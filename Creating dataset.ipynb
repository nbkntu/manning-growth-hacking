      "\n",
      "What made me give this headset the worst star rating is the fact is made of cheap plastic the same as the other Turtle beach I've owned, it broke after some use same as all other Turtle Beach I used.

      "Red Dead Redemption is a strong candidate for Action Game of the Year 2010. A sequel to Red Dead Revolver, this is an open world gun-slinging game set in the Old West.\n",
      "\n",
      "Atmosphere: 10/10\n",
      "Red Dead Redemption features one of the best settings of an open world game.  Visually, the environments are stunning, but they're also living.  As you ride through the plains, you'll see coyotes hunting rabbits, wolves chasing deer, wild horses running free, buzzards circling the dead.  As you progress through the game, the world changes.  The railroad extends through the countryside and the towns grow.  You'll see more buildings, more people, advancements in technology, and clothing styles change with the times.  The characters also go about their daily business.  In the daytime, the shops are open and the citizens perform their daily routines, at night, the saloons are packed with drinkers, gamblers, and adulterers alike.  I'd say Red Dead's Atmosphere tops Assassin's Creed 2, Fallout 3, and Oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story: 9/10\n",
      "You are John Marsten, a bounty hunter hired by the government to bring your old gang to justice.  You need to deal with a cast of misfits and shady characters to accomplish your mission.  Aside from the main story, Red Dead also features some background dialogue and themes that really set the tone for the Old West.  There's also some interesting social commentary that relates to the USA of modern day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphics: 10/10\n",
      "Red Dead is a beautiful game.  From the sunsets, to the landscapes, to the towns, to the animals, and character designs, this game is visually amazing!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Gameplay:  8/10\n",
      "Most of the game involves shooting enemies.  If you move the cursor close to an enemy, and hold the Left Trigger, the cursor will lock onto their bodies.  On Normal Mode, the cursor snapping is extremely generous, so the gameplay feels almost too easy for fans of shooters.  The game also features a resource based, Dead-Eye shooting mechanic which slows time and allows you to fire with pinpoint accuracy.  If you want more of a challenge, Red Dead has an Expert Targeting Option which makes the game much more difficult.\n",
      "One criticism about Red Dead is that the enemy types are very shallow.  Most of the enemies that you face are armed with a gun, they take cover, pop up, and shoot, then take cover again.  Some shoot at you while on horseback.  But they all feel too similar, and at times the action feels like a BB gun shooting gallery.\n",
      "This game really could have used more enemy types:  Enemies that throw dynamite with a 5 second fuse to get you to move away from cover, enemies that lasso you from horseback, stealthy tomahawk wielding \"Injuns\", would have all been welcome additions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red Dead also features a bunch of mini-games:  Texas Hold'em, Blackjack, Arm-Wrestling, 5 Finger Fillet, Liar's Dice, and Horseshoes.  These are fun, but most of the games use the most convoluted, overly complicated, control schemes that I've seen.  Why does it take 4 buttons and 2 triggers to play Poker?!  Why do you need 2 camera angles, an analog stick, and some buttons to throw a horseshoe?!  As I played Horseshoes, I thought that it would be easier to hit an enemy submarine with a depth charge using a sonar at 100 meters, than get a ringer in this game.  Although the controls are overly complicated, you can learn them quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Missions\n",
      "Most of the Missions are fun and feature interesting characters and witty dialogue.  They range from killing guys to killing more guys and then there are some where you kill even more guys.  There are also missions where you collect items, escort people, defend areas, assault trains, defend stagecoaches... usually while killing guys.\n",
      "Aside from the 57 story missions, there are also 25 Stranger Missions, Hunting Missions, Random Encounters, Treasure Hunting Missions, Sharpshooting Missions, and Gambling Missions.  Rockstar is still releasing Downloadable Content with even more Missions...\n",
      "\n",
      "Sound:  10/10\n",
      "From the ambient environment sounds, the classic western sountrack, to the gunfire, the sound really ads quite a bit to the already impressive atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiplayer:  9/10\n",
      "There are several different Multi-player Modes, too.  Capture the gold, Eliminate an Enemy Team, Free for All Shoot em up... etc.  As you play Multiplayer, you gain Experience which you can use to upgrade your character and get new horses, weapons, etc...  One good feature about Multiplayer is that if you are a Level 1 character, you can loot the corpse of a Level 50 character and use their guns.  This makes the Multiplayer Combat more about skill, than grinding to get better equipment!\n",
      "\n",
      "Replay Value:  10/10\n",
      "Although, the main story is linear, you can play as good or evil...  but the game rewards you much more for playing as good.  With a 40-100 hour Campaign, dozens of side missions, collectibles, multiplayer modes, etc...  You'd be hard pressed to find a better bang for your buck.  There's about 200 hours of entertainment here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maturity:  M\n",
      "Red Dead features sexual situations (but not sex), harsh language, drinking, and heaps of violence.  It's pretty much what you'd expect from a regular day at High School if everyone wore Cowboy Hats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall:  9.7/10\n",
      "With an incredible atmosphere, fairly easy gameplay, excellent graphics, and a good story, Red Dead should satisfy anyone with a hankerin' for the old west.\n",
      "Buy it if you like the Old West.\n",
      "Buy it if you like Open World Games.\n",
      "Buy it if you like Rockstar Games.\n",
      "I can't recommend renting it, unless you have 50-70 hours to finish it.\n",
      "Avoid it if you don't like violence or foul language.\n",

      "No More Heroes 2 Desperate Struggle is an odd game, just like its prequel. Its a game with violent, sexual humor that parodies the video game culture that has arisen in recent years. While it has many things in common with its successful prequel, No More Heroes 2 ultimately falls short of the original, and for 3 large reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "NMH2 is a much slower game. Not in story progression, and not in frame-rate, but in overall fighting controls. For the most part, Travis swings his beam sword like an old lady. His swinging animations takes much longer to come to a close, and his dodging animations take another while to respond. Also slowed down is the finishers; instead of a motion followed by slash instantaneously on screen, the finishers have an awkward second or two that detaches the player from the satisfaction of a \"slash\". This combination of elements completely ruins the fast paced feel of slashing perfection that made the original so fun to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue (touched upon by other reviews) is the disastrous camera. While not broken by any standard, it is definitely a pain that could have easily been avoided. The original game had a better automatic camera that, combined with manual control, erased any qualms anyone would have with the camera. Not only is the camera control removed from NMH2, but the automatic camera itself is actually worse. The game uses a \"stylish\" low set camera for many occasions, including when \"locked on\", that is designed to \"swivel\" and turn easily as one circles an enemy. This low set \"swivel\" camera is very difficult to handle since the game constantly uses narrow hallways and pillars that threw off the auto cam.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original game was praised for having fun and creative boss battles, and all though NMH2 has MORE bosses, it doesn't mean they are better. In fact, ill say only about half of the bosses are \"fun\" or \"creative\", and much less are BOTH \"fun  and creative\". Mosts boss characters lack a soul and personality, and some are flawed technically and frustrating to fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "NMH2 is still a good game, but it not great. The terrible camera, lame bosses, and slower game mechanics make the game a few notches below the original. NMH2 does do some things right, such as improved graphics and a more streamlined experience, but the core gameplay that made the original so great has been changed for the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bear in mind, however, that those new to the series will find MUCH enjoyment from a very solid game. I whole heartedly recommend NMH2 to anyone looking for a funny AND fun game, but veterans returning to Santa Destroy may be disappointed. My review represents the thoughts of a fan of the original, though my score is indicative of the game as it is, and not as a sequel.\n",
