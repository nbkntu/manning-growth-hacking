The control is a manufacture copy of the control provided with the console at purchase. It worded flawlessly with not issues. I did not experience or see any defects on the product.,5.0

"First of all, I'll simply say that I love this game.  It's not perfect...with the exception of maybe Chrono Trigger and Super Metroid and A Link To The Past, no game I've played is what I could call perfect; but it's a very good game.  However, I notice all these new Skyrim games coming out for PS4, and now Switch...I for one would like to see an updated Oblivion game, maybe with updated graphics, etc.  Personally, as nice as Skyrim was, I think Oblivion was a better, and more in depth game.  All the guild quests in Oblivion seemed to be a bit deeper, and the main story in Oblivion seemed to have a bit more depth.  Not knocking Skyrim...just saying that Oblivion was an AWESOME game, a game many feel was better than Skyrim.  With all these remakes for newer systems...I like to see them put out an updated Oblivion game.  Furthermore, I'd love to see a new Morrowind game...not the new Online game...but a remake of the old Xbox Morrowind.  Pretty sure I'm not the only one who'd love to see a remake of those classics.",5.0
"My favorite Wii game! So incredibly fun. The boxing workouts are sort of Guitar Hero-like in that the fists come down from the top of the screen and in keeping in rhythm with the music, you have to punch when the fist reaches the proper spot. Look for videos on You Tube if that does not make sense. There are other elements to this workout as well that are just so much fun. It's an oldie for a dated system now but still ranks as my favorite fun workout. I even bought an extra copy to have in case my disk ever breaks/malfunctions and I can't find a replacement.",5.0
"""Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude"" is the first LSL game in about 8 years, and also the first to cross over from the personal computer to home video game platforms on the Playstation 2 & XBox. As a fan of old Sierra games (even though I was too young to have played the early LSL games), I was incredibly pleased to see the series resurrected and brought to new heights!

Important note: ""Magna Cum Laude: Uncut & Uncensored"" has now been released for the PC, and it features full frontal nudity and none of the pesky ""censorship bars"" that are present in this version.

Obviously, nudity is the main selling point of this game. Anyone who says otherwise is trying too hard to justify his or her purchase. The college co-eds are voluptuous, they are animated in a sexy, often provocative, ways, and the main quest of the game is to get Larry laid. Because of the time and attention put into creating realistic (though cute in an almost-anime way), this game is more titilating than any of the ""Dead or Alive"" series of fighting games, more fun than any of the WWE wrestling video games that feature the strip matches, and the females are more desirable than Lara Croft ever has been.

The women are mostly stereotypical ""college girls"" -- we have the head cheerleader Barbara Jo Bimbo (B.J. for short), the Italian castoff from ""The Sopranos"" Analisa, the Russian exchange student Zanna, the hot but nerdy college professor Beatrice, and so on. Chasing after each woman requires different approaches, and the result is never the same twice. And no, Larry *does not* get with all these babes. I hate to spoil it for you, but he only has actual intercourse a few times during the entire game. But every encounter is sexy, funny, and most importantly, packed full of eye candy!

The gameplay is fun. It is not very involving and has been criticized for being mostly a string of ""mini-games."" That is true; however, the variety of the games keeps it interesting as you progress through the storyline. The script is absolutely hilarious, and the comedy is equal to the nudity as a selling point for this game. If you are a guy, or even a gal who likes to laugh at guys, you will laugh at Larry and the things coming out of his mouth. He rambles on a lot, gets off-topic, tries horrible pickup lines, lies constantly, and even staggers around drunk and farts. If you've ever known a man who made you laugh simply because he was, to quote Steve Martin, ""a wild and crazy guy,"" then you will enjoy the story of Magna Cum Laude. And the voice acting is wonderful; there is not a bad actor or actress in this entire game.

Now a few words on the Mature Audiences rating: This game is about sex, (...) drinking, jokes, and other things guys find enjoyable. For some people, this is disturbing. Those people need to get a life. I can play Grand Theft Auto, in which my character is able to walk down any street and at any moment cut off the head of a pedestrian with a sword. Or gun down dozens of policemen, only to enter a cheat code and get away with it all at the last possible minute. Yet somehow, the ESRB (game ratings board) finds Larry's girlfriends more offensive when they drop their shorts. Give us a break! Violence is much more detrimental to society & to teenagers than sex is, and yet we still can't get over our fear of pixelated private parts. It's ridiculous!

All in all, I give ""LSL: Magna Cum Laude"" a totally positive recommendation to anyone old enough to purchase it. It was definitely one of the best games of 2004 simply because it is like nothing else on the market today: a fun, sexy romp through college life. 5 stars! 2 thumbs up! Just buy it!",5.0
"E3 2004 came and went and AstroBoy Omega Factor was there and waiting. It played like a classic space shooter with power ups and loads of enemies to blow away. The game looks very sweet on the GBA hardware and is being developed by Treasure, the same guys that did Ikaruga and Gunstar Heroes, and the coming soon: Guardian Heroes for GBA. The hype starts here for this soon to be classic.",5.0
"StarFox Assault is quite simply the most (as in #1) action packed game on Game Cube and I have played and beaten many action packed games on Game Cube like Resident Evil 4, TimeSplitters Future Perfect, and Medal of Honor European Assault.  All of the above games have also achieved greatness.  StarFox Assault has three levels of difficulty:  Bronze, Silver, or Gold.  The single-player game does not last only three hours like so many reviews may suggest.  The single-player game lasts more like 10 hours on one difficulty.  Those of you who have beaten the game on Bronze have not beaten the game on Silver or Gold.  And if you beat it on Gold, then you can choose the option of Gold Survival, in which you have no continues or ability to save the game.  Basically, you have to beat the whole game without losing Fox's last life.  The graphics, sound, and environments are nothing short of spectacular with absolutely no slowdown in framerate at all.  True, while the Landmaster missions are a bit slower than the Arwing missions, they often require more strategy than the Arwing missions.  The ground missions by foot are excellent because you have the most diversity in choice of weapons to use during these missions.  I especially like the sniper levels.  True, Fox can run quite fast and leap really high without a humanly sense of physics, but he is a Fox and he needs to jump that high to get the job done.  If that is the only gripe one can find with the game, then that is ridiculous because nearly every game lacks physics in some respect or another.  Some of those ground missions get really hectic on Gold and are a lot of fun.  Other complaints about StarFox Assault that critics have given are that your allies are useless, while this opinion is not true, your allies frequently do need your help.  It is an intentionally installed part of the game.  Appreciate its brilliance.  The intent is to give you an extra objective to pass in a given amount of time while you are being swarmed by attackers.  These events of your allies needing your help arrive at believable times when swarms of attackers are around.  It makes things much more challenging for the experienced gamer and those that enjoy challenges because you are being attacked while you are trying to save your allies.  Ultimately, you need to be able to eliminate attackers and save your allies at the same time, which is not an easy task.  It takes quick reflexes to do so.  The game also has pretty good multiplayer options, but they are somewhat of an afterthought after the single-player game is finished.  However, this game has much replayability in trying to beat your high scores and collect all the red flags during Arwing missions.  StarFox Assault is definitely a game to own if you own a Game Cube and is my favorite game on Game Cube.",5.0
The 1st Gears of War was great and all this one did was improve on it. Loved the survival mode. It got wicked hard and kept me and my friend playing for a long time. It kept us on the edge while trying to take out the massive enemies. The story line was excellent too. The story was deep and kept suprising moments all throughout the game. I Highly recommend it to anyone who loves shooters. One of my top XBOX 360 games. The only downfall is that they didn't bring back the creatures that attacked you in the night. The missions for them last time were innovative. I feel they could have done so much more with them. But the new weapons made up for it.,5.0
"First Off I've Read Lot Of The Reviews For This Game And I Gotta Say, Stop Hating! You Guys Have Lost Your Minds. The First Suffering Game Is Amazing. It's Unique, And Has An Awesome Story Line. That Was The Introduction To The Madness, The Introduction Of Torque. This Game In My Opinion Is A Really Good Sequel. Yes I Have Seen It Skip A Few Times But (Seriously What Video Game Doesn't Freeze? They All Do) The Weapons Are Awesome, Details And Graphics Are Good. Also It's Very Gory. So Do Your Self A Favor And Pick This Game Up. It's A Fun One. It's Messed Up Though lol. Get It You Won't Be Disappointed :)",5.0

"I just got a Wii and was searching around for cheap Gamecube games that I could plan on it and found this title.

This is one of the funnest games I've played in a long time.

The 2D to ""3D"" switch when Joe transforms is really amazing.

They put some serious thought into this game.

It's like I've been transported into a cool 80s cartoon or something.

I don't see how anybody could not love Viewtiful Joe!",5.0
"To begin, I should say that watching the movie before you play the game will make it much more fun.  Unlike most games based off of movies, this game is a prequel to the movie.  It takes place three months before the beginning of the movie and you learn how the Warriors began and see the characters from the movie evolve.  It's an ingenius idea and the game is terrific.

The graphics are great, the sound is great, the plot of each mission is great.  It has the feel from the movie, too.  The music comes straight from the movie score and dark feel, the movie carried, continues in this game.  Playing, you get an opportunity to look into the background of the Warriors and the other gangs introduced in the movie.  It's outstanding.

In all honesty, I have so much good to say about this game, I'm having trouble keeping my thoughts in order.  All I can say is play it, and if you haven't seen the movie, rent the movie then play the game.  I'm telling you, you won't be dissapointed.",5.0

I got this game because I heard something about it on a game show called xplay.  It was only $19.99.  I got it home and started playing it and I looked and an hour had gone by.  The game is very fun to play and once you start time will go by and you won't even know it.  I got a ds lite and my mother and I have played and she loves it as much as I do.  It is wifi and only 1 game is required so if you get it you can play against your friends or family even if they do not have the game.  For the price and the fun this game if surely worth the purchase.,5.0

"the vita is not exactly capable of matching the graphics of the PS3, or the soon to release PS4. as a handheld, it never would have and never will.
that being said, this is a BEAUTIFUL vita game. it almost rivals Dragon's crown in the looks department.
in mercenaries, you play a merc participating in the events in Killzone 1 and 2. with the fighting taking part on vekta and Helghan, and with you accepting contracts from both the ISA and the Helghast army, as the fighting becomes hotter and more brutal. this game also shows that there is no ""good guy"" in this fight as you see, or hear of brutality committed by both sides. you receive new weapons not by picking them up, but by buying them from blackjack the arms dealer with money earned from looting ammo, completing contracts, and not dying.

-contracts is another word for story mode chapter as you switch sides because the story says so.
-no bots mode for multiplayer (word is it will happen via patch)
-the difficulty on easy is a bit too hard.

+Beautiful game, crafted with the same engine used in making Killzone 2
+each gun acts and sounds unique, with there own individual stats.
+full use of the twin stick controls, touch screen, and shoulder buttons, and they are remarkably responsive.

All and all, this is a MUST have for fans of FPS, killzone, or action gaming in general. it is an essential part of the Vita library.

What an amazing accomplishment!! I have only been at this for 12 hours give or take but this game has certainly met my expectations!  This game is not for everyone.  This not some action packed space shooter but rather a game centered around exploration and discovery.  Do I feel that this could be so much more? Sure I do!  Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to build settlements and interact (trade / fight) with other players? I believe so.  With that being said I love this game! The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is fun and relaxing.  While not for everyone I would certainly recommend it to those looking to embark on an epic quest to the stars.,5.0

"It seems that Buffalo Technology is the ONLY brand that makes quality USB NES and SNES controllers. I bought one set of the Super Famicom controllers and one set of the Famicom controllers. Both are absolutely fantastic products! I should have turned to the Japanese from the start when I needed USB controllers. All the Chinese junk I bought and returned was a big disappointment and a waste of time.

So enough complaining. How do these controllers compare to real SNES controllers? They compare very well. I have two lightly used SNES controllers and 4 decently used SNES controllers plus one heavily used controller. The A, B, X, Y, L,R, Start and Select buttons feel just like the buttons on my real SNES controllers ( the lightly used controllers I have). They have a click to them when you press down but its not a cheap stiff click. Its that familiar smooth click that feels just right.

The D-Pad on these controllers does have a different feel compared to the real SNES controllers. First the D-Pad sits higher, second it has a longer travel and third it feels slightly tactile, but not stiff. Even with those differences it doesn't affect gameplay what so ever. I'm able to control every game I've played so far with no issues at all. The D-Pads on these Buffalo SNES and NES controllers actually work! I can't say the same about the junk USB controllers I bought before these.

The Turbo Features on these controllers come in handy and do what they are supposed to do. Just pause the game ( so you don't die), hold down the turbo button and then simply press whatever button you need to have the turbo function. To clear just hold down the clear button and press the button you programmed to have the turbo function.

Overall I can't recommend these controllers enough. I was actually smiling the whole time I was using my emulator. It feels good using a quality peace of hardware.

I would really like for Buffalo Technology to make controllers for my NES, SNES, N64 and Sega Genesis consoles. Its getting hard to find good original controllers for the older consoles. If Buffalo Technology can make USB controllers this good, then I know they can make reproduction controllers for my old video game consoles.

One more thing Buffalo tech should also consider making a USB six button Sega Genesis controller. The larger six button controller not the smaller version.",5.0

"So, one day, I just got the craving for some nostalgia.

It feels better than the Nintendo SP and the two screens really ads something new, I'm glad I bought this. I recommend this to anyone.",5.0

"Okay, the word Disney on the cover scared a lot of people, we all know it's history with kiddy games.  However, this mesmerizing team-up with Squaresoft has produced an amazing Action/RPG title.
The characters, Disney and Square alike, come together to perform a striking drama, humorous at times, that tells the story of a young man and his will to live and protect those who he cares about.
The gameplay is surprisingly fast-paced and challenging at times, making it very, very addicting.  This is one of those rare gems that you can sit down and play for 4 hours straight, wondering where the time went afterwards.
Truly a memorable experience, for Final Fantasy fans, or fans of the genre.  With a sequel in the works already, Kingdom Hearts is a game that you should definitely buy.",5.0

One of the best games in all of 2008 and even the 2000's. Much better then the WII version of this game. It has much more mathces and a better & harder career/story mode then the WII version. The sample c.a.w wrestlers in this game are still the best. The best part of this game in my mind is the ECW Extreme Rules match because it has more weapons to choose from. I forgot to tell you that the wrestlers hang on longer then the ones on the WII one. I give this game a 10 out of 10.,5.0
"Must have for Wii users. (The monoprice cable is great too, I have both!) whether you've turned your WII into an emulation machine(Google ""Wii soft modding and letter bomb"") or a casual Wii/gamecuber this cable is for you.

Like I said, this and the monoprice 480p cable give you the best picture your WII can offer. YOU DO have to go into your settings and switch to EDTV/HDTV 480p mode to see the different otherwise you'll be stuck on the blurry 480i mode.

"This is one of my favorite war games for the ps2. It has many missions to keep you occupied and within those missions, you swap back and fourth from both of the sides. Each time you complete a mission you get rated on how well you did ""accuracy, abjectives, time, team player, etc.."" The better you do, the more stars you will achieve at the end. Some missions are very hard to beat especially towards the end of the game. You will find this game different at first if you are used to Call of Duty or Medal Of Honor because the controls are a bit hard to get used to. Like when you switch weapons it displays everything in your invatory. Plus, this game is a bit more tactical than the average FPS. To actually do good, or beat the missions you have to switch through people on your team. After you play the game for a while you will find yourself switching at good times and fast to get better positions or different type of weapons that each class has. This is an important role in the game. Another good thing is that if you die, you just spawn into the closest CPU you were by and continue on. The Graphics are like how i would say dark. They a kinda dull and not too detailed, like same color and so on but EA did a good job at the general graphics thoughout the game. The only flaw is how much the people look like dolls when they die, even though it is funny to see. Say you have a shotgun and shoot an enemy from say ten feet. It acts like a nuke just hit him and you see the body fly twenty or so feet or even out of the map sometimes. There is also some mini missons that you can do after beating the campagin. They are very fun yet difficult to beat though. So for how less the game costs, and all of the missions plus online, it should keep you busy for a while.",5.0

"Months ago I tried the demo for Conception II and my first taught was: ""Wow, this game just looks like an ecchi Persona game"". But after that, I keep playing it and I make my mind that this game is a must have for any otaku that likes anime-like games.

Keeping the anime desing apart, the gameplay is just awesome and the characters are just well-designed. When this game was released, people from Costa Rica's game forums just got crazy, but not in the good way, they keep saying this was just a machist excuse for otakus to play something. But in fact, there are many girls also playing it that tell them it was pretty cool and told them to try it before taling about it.

Awesome RPG and it will be appealing for any anime lover out there, Maybe it's not a must have, but sure it will be a good piece for a collection.",5.0
"Don't be too quick to judge.

A $19.99 game in which you fly around (and are unable to leave) one island in a dinky plane that doesn't seem to respond well to controls may not win you over at first.  However, after getting a sense for the island, discovering all of its carefully programmed nuances (you can fly through train tunnels, dip under bridges, skim the water, etc) and taking on a few of its missions (you choose which missions to undertake when, much like the sandbox style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Theft-Auto/dp/B000HKP88C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Theft Auto</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Endless-Ocean/dp/B002BS47L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Endless Ocean</a>), you'll discover that you can upgrade to many other aircraft (all of which respond to controls with a lot more precision than the intentionally clunky one you were given to start with) including Bi-Planes, Tri-Planes, Seaplanes, Helicopters, jets, and even a flying saucer, and (best yet) you can actually move on to two other meticulously programmed islands in the game once you've completed all the tasks for the previous one, and both have their own unique feel and qualities including a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Goonies/dp/B000QFW7UA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Goonies</a>-inspired Pirate Island plagued with pterodactyls and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Galaxy/dp/B000FQ9QVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Galaxy</a>-inspired island in the sky.  In short, this game has a lot more going for it than it may initially let on.

The only real reference point I have for explaining this sandbox-style first person flight game is to compare it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilot-Wings/dp/B000035Y21/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilot Wings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilotwings-64/dp/B000FEUHAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilotwings 64</a>, comparable simulators from earlier generation Nintendo systems with similar looks and designs.  I've been a die-hard fan of Pilot Wings 64 for years and was disappointed when Nintendo dropped its plans to produce one for the Wii.  As it turns out, however, Kid Adventures: Sky Captain maintains nearly all the strengths of the Pilot Wings franchise and adds a lot more to top the previous games.

PROS (compared to Pilot Wings and Pilot Wings 64)

- Wii motion controlled.  You move the controller to move the plane.  Granted, it doesn't simulate how you actually fly a plane at all, but the motions are far more intuitive and fun than the old thumb-stick interface. Once you upgrade to the second and third planes, the wii motion controls prove to be surprisingly precise for a budget game.

- Better designed maps.  There's a lot more to see and do.  You can really have fun exploring every inch of the island without things feeling too repetitive and, since this is a sandbox-style game (unlike Pilot Wings) YOU choose when its time to move on and start a new mission, as well as when you'd like to spend more time exploring.  With the exception of sheep that seem to have the physical properties of concrete walls, the islands are very well mapped.  You rarely find glitches, oversights, or bland areas that the programmers clearly didn't want you to observe.  Every inch of every island has been lovingly programmed for you to explore.

- Greater variety of vehicles.  While you have to earn your way on to other vehicles (you could choose them from the start in Pilot Wings), you get a lot more to choose from, as mentioned earlier on.  I still can't wait to see what the flying saucer is like!  Additionally, I find the helicopter in this game a lot more maneuverable than the gyrocopter in PW.  I do miss the difficulty of the hang glider, but you get a lot of the same charm with the propeller planes.

- Better graphics.  This should go without saying in a newer generation console game, but the graphics in this game are quite charming and aesthetically pleasing, even while they're hardly elaborate.  The appearance does an excellent job of matching the tone of most of the core Wii games.  In fact, the first island reminds me of the running island from Wii Fit.  Very beautiful and interesting to look at.

- Better music.  The music in this game is nothing short of impressive.  What begins as soothing without seeming repetitive quickly jumps into a Danny Elfman inspired film score as soon as you undertake a challenge, and the little dings and alerts the game offers to let you know any number of things are charming and never obnoxious.  The tone manages to stay calm and relaxing while adding the appropriate level of excitement during missions.

- More to do.  There are a lot more challenges in this game than in PW, and while many are similar, none ever bore me and few are ever frustrating.  The same was most certainly not true of Pilot Wings, in which certain levels had the wrong balance of boring and frustrating, leaving me to walk away from the console for several days at a time.  These challenges are rarely boring and rarely take a long time.  Really, my only criticism is that the level of challenge isn't as high, though this comes with the whole sandbox aspect to the game.  There's almost no penalty for crashing, which encourages you to play, explore, and experiment more, but it also removes some of the challenge.  Of course, if you choose to pursue the optional achievements, those can be a lot more difficult to execute.

- Water cannon.  In addition to being able to take pictures like in PW, you now have a water cannon, which takes on a variety of uses in different missions, from putting out fires, to watering crops, and even to shooting out barricades blocking tunnel tracks and knocking an opponent off course.  Kid-safe weapons are fun!

- MULTIPLAYER MODE!  Where the heck was this in Pilot Wings?  It's LONG overdue.  I only wish there was a battle mode.  Instead you co-op and compete with another player to finish missions, which is still very fun.

CONS (as compared to Pilot Wings and Pilot Wings 64)

- No hang glider nor rocket pack

- Not many gauges.  You have to visually determine how far you are from sea level, there's no overhead map for determining how far you are from your intended destination, and there's no fuel gauge because your fuel never runs out.  All in all, the absence of these gauges rarely affects my enjoyment of the game, but a veteran Pilot Wings fan will find it unsettling to operate without these gauges at first.

- Level of difficulty.  As mentioned previously, the level of difficulty is a bit lower than in PW (though this does not decrease the fun much at all since the emphasis is on exploration, experimentation, and mechanics, not mission completion).  The only real loss is when it comes to photography missions. In the old games, you were graded on the quality of the pictures you took in flight.  In Sky Captain, you can take a picture at any angle (distance and centering don't matter either), and you do well as long as you snap the photo.  The only issue is how long it takes you to get the pictures, not how good they are.

- Game Saves/Customization.  As another reviewer mentioned, you can only save three games at a time, and there's no option to personalize your character or change the name (you are given two pre-made choices).  The personalization issue was not a big deal to me since you never see the character in the game, but they are addressed by name whenever they receive a new mission, so not being able to choose your own is a small disappointment.  All in all though, I think the game was designed with the intent of an entire family working together to explore and compete missions, not individual family members customizing their own characters and playing on their own.  This is suggested by the fact that, once you complete a mission, you are encouraged to revisit that mission and beat the top score at any given time, so mom may want to go back and destroy dad's best scores hours later in the game.  Besides, the game is nearly as fun to watch as it is to play, so we naturally chose to have the whole family play and switch off on one game before we even realized that doing it any other way wouldn't be as practical.  You can really get in some meaningful family time while playing this game, and a lot of that would be lost with each member having their own personalized game to play and save.

- Short game.  I suspect this is the reason why a game this strong sells for so little.  I've already gotten to the third and final island, and I approximate that I've been playing for about 7 hours (I kept playing after the rest of my family moved on with their day!).  I suspect other adult gamers might complete the game even faster (families and younger children will inevitably take longer to complete missions and compete for better times/scores).  The game is too much fun to put down but, as a result, you finish it FAST.  I'm honestly sad that I've already made it to the final island, so I'm stalling and holding off on completing it for as long as possible.  Fortunately, there are still MANY challenging optional achievements to unlock on each island (combing every last inch of an island to gather all 100 red rings has been particularly interesting) but, while working on achievements and earning new skins for your aircrafts is still fun, some of the newness and sense of discovery wears off once you've made it to all three islands and unlocked all of the aircrafts.

All in all, this is an amazing update of a classic console series that I've been missing for years now.  Whether or not you've ever even heard of Pilot Wings, if you like limitless exploring and experimenting in a game, if you enjoy flight simulators and innovative game mechanics, or if you're simply looking for a incredibly exciting, yet entirely unstressful game the entire family can enjoy, then this is absolutely the one for you!",5.0

"When Sony decided to go into the handheld gaming market, I think they wanted to appeal to the same demographic as their big brother console. And that means attracting a more mature audience. Nintendo tends to capture the ""family"" market, which isn't a bad thing.

I say this because if there's any game that truly defines and epitomizes what the PSP is all about, then Syphon Filter Dark Mirror is that game. This game represents all that the PSP is capable of. It is to bad that other developers have not pushed their resources for their games to be this good in so many ways. Everything from graphics, controls, to the all-important fun factor is on point with this title. The storyline is engaging, the levels are beautifully rendered, and the missions are diverse. You really do feel like the character you're controlling in the game, that's how good it is. I have read complaints about the boss characters not being so over-the-top like in other games. That doesn't matter so much to me, because as you go up against them, it still requires skill, patience, trial, and error to beat them. That's the challenge and the fun of any video game. If anyone gets a Sony PSP, then this is the first game they should buy.",5.0

You can, actually, get a half an hour of game play and complete one part of the game nicely.",5.0

It's all about preference really...

This game is now my favorite PS4 Game!!!,5.0

"The best shooter I ever played was Battlefield Bad Company two and the expansion pack Vietnam. But I didn't enjoy Battlefield 3 or Battlefield 4. I especially hated Hardline. So while I always wanted to go back and play a WW I or WW II in a DICE game. I held my expectations in check due to the fact Battlefront was a shallow puddle of a game. I also can't speak for anyone else, but the future based shooters are extremely boring for me. So this was the only option for me this year. Outside of Gears 4 which I had always been a fan of since the beginning.

I fired this game up and man did it remind me of Battlefield 2, which to me is an underrated masterpiece. This game has depth, breathtaking graphics and interesting game modes that offer hundreds of hours of fun. My favorite game mode is War Pigeons, I have already been in some great heart stopping matches. With classics like Rush and Conquest you are set.

He is the secret weapon of Battlefield 1. The campaign is amazing. With great actors in them. It is the only shooter campaign I have ever played all the way through and loved. This game is Band of Brothers Battlefield, I realize Band of Brothers was WW II but you need to know the feel of the campaign and entire game. For me this is the best shooter I have ever played, and I have been playing since the original Doom.

Battlefront, I said was like trying to play a beautiful photograph but was a very shallow experience. I am glad DICE crafted a game to match it's amazing game engine. This and Dark Souls 3 are my games of the year. With Dark Souls 3 slightly losing out if I had to pick.

Only small gripe I have - if I had to find something wrong. Is the RNG nature of Battle packs. After each match players are randomly selected for a battle pack which can contain rare weapons or skins. I wish there was a currency system apart from the option to break down doubles of items. A currency we could grind on to unlock packs ourselves - like Warbonds. But I just hate RNG after my years of WoW but this doesn't bother me that much.

Pros
- Graphics
- Depth
- Gameplay
- Music
- Game Modes

Cons
- RNG nature of Battlepacks. (If I had to find something)

Grade
A+ Game of The Year

Conclusion
Battlefield 1 does everything right, which is something shooters haven't done in years - it brought us back to simpler times and apple pie dinners. For too long other shooters pushed the modern angle, with annoying future tech that overall ruined gameplay and messed with the flow of games. There is an emotional attachment for many when it comes to World War II and I later periods can't match.
The multiplayer is a masterpiece but the real shocker is the top flight campaign that is like playing Band of Brothers WW I. This game simply has no weaknesses and for me is my 2016 game of the year.",5.0
absolutely perfect.,5.0
"The original Rayman is perhaps one of the finest platformers that ever came out. There's a reason why this game has been re-released for some times (Not as much as Rayman 2, but still). That reason is...everything.

The game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to in a video game. I can tell there were LOTS of effort put into this masterpiece. You can even put the game into a CD player and it would play the music!

Before there was Ly, Lums, Razorbeard, the Rabbids, or even Globox for that matter, there was Rayman, the fairy that created him, and the evil Mr. Dark. This was a platformer that just suddenly improved upon everything people loved about platforming games. It had great gameplay, catchy music (as noted), and amazing graphics that reveal hugely detailed environments.

As you start the game, you only start out with the basics: Running and jumping. But that as you progress through, you get newer powers, such as being able to hang on platforms, THROW your FISTS at enemies (Man, that's cool), and >GASP< being able to fly for a short period of time! Sure, later games have these powers as staples to Rayman's character, but back when this was the only game out, you have to work your way to get these....and you would have fun doing it.

The problem is that younger gamers may be put off by the game's difficulty. Yeah, it is challenging, but some find it to actually be TOO challenging. Nevertheless, this is a gem that you should buy in case you have a Playstation lying around.",5.0

"THE ABSOLUTE BEST GAME ON EARTH?

Well, folks....I'm not going to go into every detail here, because there's already 125 reviews.....BUT, I will say this:

If you don't have this game already, then I ask, WHY NOT?????? Simply put, this game is prob...I MEAN, it's THE best game for PS3. HANDS DOWN! Actually, I'd say it should win best game of 2010. I'd also say that the entire G.O.W. Trilogy should go into the video game hall of fame!

PROS:
Serious gore, mayhem, anger, violence, destruction, bloodshed, MANY upon MANY demonic bad guys, awesome ""weapon power ups"", some very challenging puzzles, wicked kill moves, challenging gameplay, and did I mention blood & gore? Also, this game sports some of the most beautiful environments I've ever seen in a video game. Kudos to the designers, and kudos for their commitment on some of the smoothest gameplay, as well!

CONS:
Get your thumb ready for some SERIOUS button mashing! (really, I ain't kiddin') By the end of the game, my thumb fell right off!

"This review is for people who have played The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.

This game is much like Morrowind, it's predecessor, but they have fixed the serious gameplay flaws of Morrowind.

The monsters now level with you, so you don't have a walkover once you get to a high level and you now get fun battles up through the levels.  They have thus solved the problem of balance while still letting you do whatever you want.

It no longer seems possible to be able to make super powerful potions using alchemy and intellingence potions.  I believe that you can only have 4 potions affecting you at once.

Fast travel, that is just clicking on a place on the map to go there (if it's a city or you've been there before) greatly reduces the amount of walking required.

Quest markers, marks on the map that tell you where to go for the next part of the active quest, greatly ease doing quests, though the wonderful, colorful, and thick strategy guide is still well worth buying.

These with the other improvements like better graphics, better AI of non-player characters, people who each look different, and voices with lip-syncing for all non-player character dialog  make this a much more polished and perfected game.

However, there is a bug in this game that almost made me give it up until I found a fix on the forums.  The bug only affects some players for some reason.  If you can't get the Bravil recommendation quest, press the '~' button and then type in

'setstage MG03Illusion 100'

"I have owned the CH Products Fighterstick for a little over a month now and I am now ready to compose a full review. I have been a MS Sidewinder force feedback2 user for years. I was very happy with that stick but when I started playing Lock On I decided that it was time to step up to the plate and purchase a real HOTAS system. At first glance the fighterstick appears to be built to last. It is constructed of very heavy gauge plastic and all of the devices seams are sealed properly. It is not flimsy or fragile in appearance or feel.

The stick only comes with an instruction sheet. There is no owners Manual or software disk included. The new owner must download the drivers and CH Control Manager software from the CH website. Setup is a very simple operation which involves plugging your stick into it's own USB port and running the drivers software. Setup was completed without a hitch and I did not miss the absent owners Manuel. I then proceeded to use the CH Manager software to configure the stick for the first time. It was at this time that I encountered my first and only problem while using the software. While attempting to configure the Y axis I noticed that the stick's signal would jump from one end of the scale to the other with very little movement from the stick itself. I could not figure out what the problem was on my own so I called CH customer service and they told me to be sure and center the two trim wheels before configuration. Sure enough after I corrected the position of the two wheels, the configuration process was completed without a problem.

Next, I ran Lock On in order to put the stick through it's first flight trials. The Fighterstick fits my medium sized hand very well. My only complaint is the fact that button #2 is located very high on the stick and is hard for me to reach without repositioning my hand. I believe this is due to the fact that this stick is based on the design of the F-16 joystick configuration. The problem with this choice of design styles is that the real F-16 stick is mounted between the legs and at about waist height inside the cockpit, where as the CH Fighterstick will be mounted on some ones desktop. This creates an ergonomic problem that the F-16 design was not meant to handle. Beside my issue with button #2, I have experienced no other problems with manipulation of the stick ingame.

Stick response and accuracy are very good. I can pull all kinds of high ""G"" maneuvers, fire all kinds of weapons and deploy my counter measures with a level of speed and accuracy that I have never experienced before. All the buttons work as programmed and the x/y axis is very smooth. Some say that the springs in the stick base are very lite. I don't feel that there is anything unusual or loose concerning the feel of this stick. I am very comfortable with the level of tension in the stick. Keep in mind that I have been working with the Sidewinder up to this point and that this may be the reason why I don't have a problem with the level of tension in the stick.

CH Control Manager is a wonderful program that gives you the ability to adjust all of the sticks important settings. It also allows you to create your own personal button program maps which can be loaded or saved for future use. CH Control Manager does not come with a tutorial so you will need to consult with an experienced user in order to fill in the blanks left after you have read the online user guide, as I did. After asking a few questions on an internet user forum I was ready to begin programing the stick for the first time. Once you know how to use it, CH Control Manager is a joy to work with. However it is not as intuitive as I would have liked it to have been.

The CH products Fighterstick is considered the top of the line PC flight controller. Unlike Thrustmaster's best stick it doesn't have any outstanding quality control issues. The Fighterstick has an excellent maintenance record and I am confident that it will last me for many years of flight siming fun.

Update: I stand corrected on the position of the stick in the real F-16, however I stand by my criticism of the feel of the stick when used in the desktop position. Thanks to the PC cockpit I now use, I no longer experience this problem.",5.0

"This game is really crude and simplistic by today's standards, being just about 10 years old. A total of three weapons, and three primary enemies (with a handful of bosses), 320x200 resolution, 8-bit funky, plunky music. (Great rendition of the Nazi anthem and a lot of good mood music, given the limitations.)
Originally, the id designers had something more elaborate in mind, and then stripped it all out to make a pure action game. And as such, it still manages to offer a few visceral thrills, with Nazis jumping out from behind you, rabid German Shepherds leaping for your throat and the like.
Wolf3D, of course, was the seminal modern First Person Shooter, having countless spin-offs and reintroducing the first person viewpoint to the PC (which used FP consistently only for things like flight/space sims).

"""Goldeneye 007"", at first glance, looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated ""First-Person"" shooter game genre. The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.
In a word, ""Goldeneye"" is amazing. It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth, fun, and challenging adventure. You assume the role of James Bond, the secret agent who needs no introduction. You run through various missions, which tie into the movie, and solve various problems and perform various tasks. What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight. As expected, you have a number of weapons at your disposal, from the silenced pistol and machine gun, to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives. The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game, with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond's charm.
The graphics are phenominal, with smooth movements and amazing scenery. This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures. The music is right out of a Bond movie, and adds a nice edge to the action. The controls, usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller, are easy to manage here. After a while it becomes like second nature.
For parents considering this game for their children, they should be aware of the violence. Much of the game is spent killing people, and the realism is striking. It is up to you, but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictive.",5.0

"This game was a very beautiful game. I love action games and this one is quite the hack n slash, but it also requires some skill as well. Some parts in the game are quite hard and are very challenging. Especially some of the bosses and also the parts where you have the 'aim' the arrows using the six axis. That was a very cool, unique, and fun element which was added to the game.

The reason I gave this game 5 stars is mainly based off the soundtrack and voice acting. Dont get me wrong, the game play was awesome as well, but the soundtrack was VERY nicely executed. The soundtrack is somparable to a major motion picture and the voice acting is bar none the best voice acting I have EVER seen in a video game and possibly even better than most CG movies made to date. It made the storyline very believable which really engulfed you into the game. You don't realize how big of a difference this makes until you play this game. I was kinda hoping this would raise the bar for the gaming creation community as far as really getting a games 3D models to portray accurate facial expressions and lip synching, but am still disappointed to date with even the newer releases of incredibly high budget games such as God of War 3, which is one of my favorite games of all time, but the voice acting is no where in comparison to Heavenly Sword.

I borrowed this game from a friend, beat it, and had a hard time handing it back to him. I highly recommend this game and think I will just have to buy my own copy for keepsake even though I've already beat it. +++",5.0
"Works like a charm! Had an issue with controller but was straighten out ASAP by company :) Interface is a tad different from what I am use to and the voice function is not ironed out yet but will be soon enough... One more thing, games take forever to install as they have massive updates (10 gigs) that need to install first and the Xbox network is a tad bit slower than their rivals. No fear, as there is a work around..

Disable your network connection while installing game and its a breeze, sure you will not have it updated but if you cant wait... This will work. After play, enable it and hit the hay! Done and done.",5.0

"some pointers before you begin
1. This thing is heavy. If you drop it it may cause serious injury
2. This thing is big. Even though this is a toy, it makes feel the others like toys
3. You need to put some muscle into moving it. If you have not tried it yet, you will notice a huge difference with what you may be used to by now. I did not find stickiness (though I have not tested every single one that has came out of the factory), but may be that what other people call stickiness is part of its size and the force you have to use to move this. Even so, once you pass the surprise, this is what becomes natural, and the others feel like plastic sticks (though they are)

The movement is quite fluid and precise",5.0

"Excellent game. Really is a great action zombie open world playground. Varied enemy types, cool day/night cycle. We've got a really great atmosphere here in Dying Light and it really goes a long way. Graphics are great, the gameplay, mainly the melee combat and parkour system are great. Sound and music are also top notch.

Aside from some technical issues, where the game falls short a bit is the main story and characters. I went in knowing not to expect much so I actually kind of enjoyed it a bit. I also liked a few of the characters. It's a shame cause it could've been better, but overall it's really not that bad. The side missions, although short and straight forward, are fun. They are just enjoyable and quite a few are either really creepy or really funny. It's mostly a serious game but the fact that they took some time to add a little humor and character to the game is greatly appreciated. 4.3/5.",5.0

"[...] I found my kitten. They act just like the Nintendo Dogs except they meow. You can pick your choice of kitten face at the adoption house. Then you get to get to trust you, you always have to look at the bubbles that tell you when they are hungry,need water & use the little box. They meow,purr just like kittens & cats. You don't have to wash them like the dog's or buy leashes,go for a walk. Also I noticed that you can't add extra kittens in your home, so they have some one to cuddle with.
 That you can do with the dogs. You need to earn extra coins to go shopping for the cats clothing,food & water. So you'll need to teach the cat to run fast, jump,leap,etc. If your cat gets sleepy then you 'll hear them and see the yellow ZZZZZZZZZZ.

"Video Game adaptations of cartoons are hit and miss, but South Park: The Stick of Truth is spot-on, just about perfect.  I haven't watched South Park in years, but I played this with my girlfriend's little brother and we had a great time. The humor is still outrageous and biting, there are a lot of references to South Park ""lore"" (can you use ""lore"" for SP?), most of which I didn't get because I haven't watched the show, but the diehard player next to me delighted in it.  The controls are surprisingly decent, for someone who has played only PC games the past few years (i.e., me), and from a graphics standpoint it looks exactly like you're in the show.  Fantastic showing for the South Park game, I hope there are more to come.",5.0

"I am a 70 year old gamer and bought my first console December 2016 - the Xbox.  That unit served me well so with new enhancements to the Xbox X I decided to sell my regular Xbox and buy the new Xbox X (Scorpio Edition).  I also purchased a 4 TB Western Digital Passport External Hard Drive (WDBYFT0040BBK) for $99.00 which is working out great and was very simple to connect.  I have had the new console about a month.  I am loving it and, so far, have had no problems with either the console or external HD.

I have the Xbox X connected to an older LG TV.  An unexpected surprise was how much the graphics quality of my games increased even though my TV is not 4K.  I had also planned on purchasing a 4K TV but, with the graphics increase, I may just save the money.  It loads non-4K games slightly faster and seems to create a smoother gameplay.  I also like the reduced console size.  Packaging was good, protected the unit well, and has a pleasant appearance.

Several reviews indicate a variety of problems with the new console.  I have not had any issues with mine (knock one wood).  I also never had any issues with my Xbox One console. I was looking at also purchasing a PS4 Pro (because I like some of their  exclusive games) but there seems to be many problems with that console according to their verified purchase reviews.  Also Sonys tech support appears to be non-existent according to many of their reviewers.  Bottom line, no matter what tech product you get, some are going to have problems.  My Xbox 1X works great so far and I am very pleased.

Also, I paid $499 for my unit.  Not sure Id pay $620 for any console!",5.0

"She says it is just like the TV show and she loves being able to play as her favorite character Pacman. Some parts she finds a little difficult to conquer, but all in all she is very happy we got her this game for her birthday.

From an adult perspective, I think this is very much a kids game and not too challenging, so not for the teens and up really, unless they are big into Pacman.

Would also like to say we have the Xbox version - a friend has the DS version and we didn't like that version at all - so if it comes to a choice between the 2, I'd choose the Xbox game.",5.0

"After missing so many pokemon games in between, I recently played pokemon X and most recently omega ruby. After completing both of these games, here is what thought of omega ruby.

*************************************************************************PROS*************************************************************************
Combat/level up gameplay: This is the number one reason to play the game. It offers strategic combat and rpg like leveling system. I find such gameplay to be highly addictive. I like the ideas of unlocking new moves by leveling little monsters and creating a unique team to overcome a variety of challenges.

Evolution/Mega-evolution: This is what really got me into the pokemon series. Not only you combat and level up with your pokemons but many of them evolve into meaner and tougher creature as combat and level them up. I really love the design of some of them. I also like the the concept of mega-evolution. It pumps the combat with even more energy.

Story/Journey: I found the story/journey of this game to be the most fun of all the pokemon games I have played so far. I especially liked the ending scence after you become the champion. With me exploring as much as I can on my own, this game has lasted me 80 hr plus.

Post-game bonus story: As if the story was not enough, this game offers a post game story called delta episode where you dive even deeper into the main story while combating new foes and catching rarer pokemons. Love it.

Variety of pokemon: This is perhaps one of the strongest suit of this game. It offers a huge variety of pokemons. So most likely you will find some companions you will enjoy through your journey. And if you are collector, you will find yourself playing this game for a very long time.

Legendaries: This game has a decent amount of legendaries. Some say that is too much. I say there is no such thing as too many legendaries. I enjoyed catching all of them.

Open world/rematches: Like previous game, it is an open world system that you gradually unlock. Liked the idea of re-visiting places and having rematch with different in story players.

Graphics: Big improvement in graphics compared to games before pokemon x/y. Definitely makes playing this game more rewarding.

Timing(the good): A lot of things such as mega evolution and certain legendaries are unlocked relatively early in the game. A big plus!!

Online component: Online battles, trading etc. is also a plus.
*************************************************************************CONS*************************************************************************
Missed opportunities/Timing(the bad): I feel that after so many generations, they should start unlocking things even earlier. For example a huge variety of regular as well as legendaries are not available to you till near the last gym. I feel that is too late. I say after 4th gym is a good time to unlock variety of pokemons. That way player can play with pokemon of their choice. Towards the end you do end up getting access to these pokemons but then there is relatively less to do with them (still this game is better than X/Y in terms of the post game activities.) Also not every journey needs to start with new novice character. After so many generation, it may be time to have an experienced character start the game and have early access to things such as mega-evolution.

"I have been seeing KontrolFreeks for a while now out in the stores, but was never interested until I saw these Destiny themed ones. Many others that I saw were a bit too tall, and looked like they would be uncomfortable to play with, I even ended up buying something cheaper to grip better with instead of the KontrolFreeks that I saw in store, while they work, they catch sweat too easy from my hands and that can be uncomfortable. But down to the good stuff, these Destiny KontrolFreeks are the best for the PS4 controller, they don't raise the height an insane amount, they just feel right. While I've only tried them on Destiny, I'm sure they would work pretty well with other Shoothers plus these look great. I ended up buying 2 pairs just because I liked the look of them so much, but getting to play with them, even better!",5.0

"I played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it. I was not that in to the 64 back then. But now i think it is very fun and entertaning. The graphics r good for the 64, including that it was the first game ever for it. That is why almost everyone who has a 64 has this game. If u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game, which is only a couple years apart, these graphics seem life like. It has a great adventure but its weird that Luigi is not in this game. It adds much more new items,charecters,and levels. I like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios. Ever since this game most marios have been first person view.

"Maybe its just me, but I love the game.  I was 4 when I got my hands on it, and I'm 14 now but the game is good for the both age groups.
The MP system is redone in the past, which clearly is the last of the [Each Spell takes one point] system.  FF2j (Only in Japan) was the first to introduce the system of Magic Points and such (Cure takes 5 and Meteo takes 80, complicating).  Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is probably one of my favorites simply because it was easy to understand and the storyline was actually understandible (FF4 confused me).  The music was some of the best, and I couldn't stop playing the game.  I used to stay up until 2am playing the game.
FFMQ is no FFX or Lufia 2, but it specializes for the younger ons, such as myself.  I still play the game to this day, but then again if you're in the Adult ages I'd consider you to rent it (then again it'd probably be cheaper to buy since it came out TEN years ago).  It was the game of its time, and it truly is the beginning of FF's sucess; clearly a GREAT start to new RPG'ers to the RPG systems of today, and a good way to bring up the confidence in yourself.",5.0

"Correct me if im worng but MML1 recieved controversial hysteria from those few who knew about it, it was dissed and trashed for not following the 2d blue bombers previous exploits, but when i playerd it, i loved it even though i had played MM's previous Gameboy,Playstation and NES games, and i was not dissapointed by MML1 (megaman legends 1) at all, it was pretty large and the fact that you could make weapons from scrap parts found in ruins was icing on the glorious 3d cake. and so when megaman legends 2 hit shelves i ahd to check it out, i will say this now, Play megaman legends 1 first if you can since A. its incredibly great and B. you cant really understand this whole thing if you haven't played and beaten 1, though its not required. but in MML2 the blue bomber is back in all his plated glory, this time the gorup continues their search for the motherlode on a strange icy tundra island, once there you fight hordes of Reaverbots and eventually meet a mysterious young lady, this all takes place after the wicked opening cut-scene which is sure to please all. i won't go too deep into the story since its pretty hard to understand even if you ahve played the game. but Megamans little friend Data (a dancing monkey creature) is back to give you advice,Save your game and refill your health and special weapona ammo,all of which you'll need for the vicous boss fights, but more on that later. then theres Roll who is megamans best friends (and love ineterest?). she is a mechanical genius and flies the flutter and makes special wepaons out of worthless junk you find in ruins (more on these later too). she is on a quest to retrieve the motherload and find her long lost (apparebntly dead) parents. and megeaman is the brave and willing digger (people who search ruins for treasure) who's role goes much deeper than nyone would've expected. then theres the countless pirates who you basically need to play 1 to understand at all (they're back, the bonnes i mean) they are also joined by a new pirate friend, Glyde and his caste of Birdbots and then theres Klaymoore and Bola somne f the coolest badguys ever, Klaymoors big and mechanical with lots of guns while Bola is sleek and fast with a cool sword and pincer arm. they sonstantly try to thwart megaman on his digger quests. now on to the ruins and world etc. this world is double the size of MML1 which is a godsend for those who didn't want the first one to end (me being one of them), there are many islands to explore now each full of a city, mini quests and games and lots of ruins where you scrounge up junk for Roll to make into special weapons which can devestate just about anything later on, this adds a huge bit of exploration to the game. bosses are huge and hard, alot of them are huge reaverbots and pirates in this game with multiple strategies and attack patterns making them difficult but not overly so, these bosses are numbering far above the teens in number so don't expect to see a shortage of these fun and sometimes hilarious bosses who stay on a good path of hard but not frustratingly tedious. and the graphics are very niucely done for a playstation game, they are very anime-ish with the occasioanl Jaggy and megaman looks cool, so does Roll and the rest of the cast (my favorite characetr is Bomb Bonne though, HEH =P), the towns and cities are nicely rendered but the ruins sometimes look very similiar and hallways are almost always alike. these ruins are also too few in number and the ones you HAVE to explore (involved in the main quest) are sometimes too large and long to cope with particularly Ninos ruin which is very tedious and takes like 30 minutes to beat, all in all however this game is great for anyone who is a fan of the blue bomber and great for first timers alike, in one word, think of Zelda, thats the best way to describe this game, Zelda for the PSX.",5.0

"Note this review is supposed to be for the original ""PSP 1000"" a.k.a. the ""phat"" model. The main reason I like this device is for the hacks and mods you can easily do to it. If you know what you're doing you can down grade the firmware all the way back to version 1.5 and from there load any number of ""homebrew"" applications. Yes, this can be used for illicit purposes but there are actually legitimate reasons. Personally I buy all my games and play them in between various fun homebrew applications. For instance there is one called PSPTube and another called PiMPStreamer.

With PSPTube you can search YouTube videos and play them directly on the PSP. PiMPStreamer allows you for streaming over wifi of existing media stored on a local PC in flash video format. Installing and setting these two functions up may not be for the faint of heart, especially downgrading firmware from any version 3.51 or higher, but these just two examples of the great home apps that can be used.

If you're not interested in all that extra stuff that requires voiding your warranty and/or ""bricking"" your PSP, the system itself has a lot of impressive features. For instance you can bring up a screen with a bunch of streaming radio broadcasts (assuming you have wireless internet access). You can also subscribe to RSS feeds, though I do not like how they set it up, and a built-in web browser.

The web browser has obvious limitations and a visit to the wrong site will result in an ""out of memory"" error. I have noticed in at least one example a page formatted for the iPhone seemed to work pretty well for the PSP's browser. Of course, you can hardly blame the PSP for a lack of mobile device-friendly pages on the internet.

Then there's playing videos and audio off the memory stick, displaying photos and the great UMD games you can get. My favorite right now is PuzzleQuest. I don't know if it's any better/worse than the DS or any other version but I think it's really fun.",5.0

I don't like that you can't use them on the first system but my son is happy that they came out with the super hero's on the 2.0 system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night.,5.0
"now at first i was thinking that this would be a kiddy game like recite the alphabet for points. However the thing that got me to get it was that squaresoft did it found that it had final fantasy in it. Now, I hadn't owned anything from them before but knew that they had done final fantasy. When i got the game, I was blown away. and i'm going to say it again I WAS BLOWN AWAY. i am not a big fan of ps2 but i owned it. It is worthwile and there is talk of a sequal. at the start you get a movie, and it's above average, I'm still trying to find where i can get that song when sora's on the beach but here's a preview of the start.

"BioShock Infinite is by far one of the best games I have ever played. I am an experienced first-person shooter on the PC. I bought a copy for the PS3. Switching over was very annoying since I'm not good with analog sticks, but with the auto aim ability, it made it a more enjoyable experience. I breezed through on hardmode and only at the very end of the game it got challenging for me. The story and music in this game are top tier. I would highly recommend this game.

Getting everything in the game can be about a 12-16 hour play through while speeding through everything can be done in about 6 hours. I would say it doesn't have any replay value after two play throughs.

I do admit the fully 3D interface is tricky to get used to esp. after games like Simcity and Roller Coaster Tycoon.  But with a little time I liked it.  The graphics are really good with a highly textured lunar surface and fairly well rendered buildings.  The map is quite big allowing for a large colony with plenty of room for expansion.  You first need to build a control center then ""inflatable homes"" for your colonists.  You also construct oxygen plants and power production plants.  Everything is connected via either above, or below ground tunnels.  As you progress thru the game more buildings become available due to ""research"", a common feature of games such as Starcraft and Roller Coaster Tycoon.  You make money thru mining and exporting as well as tourists.  You can trade goods with Earth or aliens (yes aliens).  The game takes place in 2021 and Earth is in crisis as it runs out of natural resources.  The game is refreshingly original and I recommend it to any sim fan!  Check it out!",5.0

"Fantastic collector's edition! The Pip-Boy is plastic, but makes for a great display and the fact that it's actually wearable makes me all kinds of happy! Also the tin case is a nice bonus.

Despite its shortcomings, Fallout 4 is a great game that should not be missed. The world is detailed, the environments are quite varied, the combat is fantastic, and the writing is solid. Definitely more shooter than RPG which is a little disappointing, but overall it plays well.",5.0

Not much you can do to Dexter, but you better pay attention to what he said. The game play is great and the graphic is wonderful. And other reviewers are right, there is no load time, well almost no load time. It gives me a feeling that it is a fast pace 'Final Fantasy' game. I recommend this game to everyone from 6 to 36.",5.0

"I thought I wasn't going to like the Kirby Series Meta Knight Amiibo as much as I like the Smash Bros series Meta Knight. But now it's a toss-up for me. The Smash Bros Meta Knight has really awesome wings. But the Kirby Series Meta Knight is slightly larger, has a better paintjob, and has much shinier paint.

Either Meta Knight Amiibo will work with Smash Bros. Either Meta Knight will unlock the sword costume in Planet Robobot. But this new Meta Knight also gives Kirby a Meta Knight Mask. This is the only way to unlock the sword mask costume, but you can get the sword attack with other Amiibos and in game.

But I don't see myself using the Amiibo often in my copy of Planet Robobot. It's not like you need extra help in the game. I just got all four of the new Kirby Amiibos because I think they look cool on my shelf together.",5.0

"Legend of Legacy features key development staff from Square Enix's ""SaGa"" series, including composer Masashi Hamauzu (SaGa Frontier II, UNLIMITED:SaGa) and illustrator Tomomi Kobayashi (entire SaGa series). The game was developed by a relatively new studio, FuRyu (previous work includes Unchained Blades), and published by Atlus. Much like a traditional SaGa game, you can choose from one of seven characters for your first adventure. Each character has a chief motive driving them into the game's overarching narrative. For some characters, their motive plays into each and every change, each and every dungeon. For other characters, their motivations merely provide humor and flavor text as you go.

No matter what you do, one thing you will notice is that this turn-based RPG (per SaGa standards) is *hard.* But, you cannot grind your way out of it. In SaGa games, including LoL, you will need to grind smart, not hard. It is important to balance which offensive, defensive, and support stances you learn, as well as what skills you develop. Will each of your three party members learn one of the three elemental charm spells, or will you have one character who learns all three elemental charm spells while another character focuses on physical attacks, and a third on defense? You have a lot of options, and those options will determine which mandatory (and optional) bosses you can easily topple, and which ones will become monumental struggles.

From an aesthetic experience alone, Legend of Legacy is great. Its mechanics are rough around the edges, but still solid. I very much look forward to this game's sequel, ""The Alliance Alive.""",5.0
"Pac-Man has had his fair-share of Ports. Including:
Atari 2600
Atari 5200
NES
Game Boy
Game Gear
Game Boy Color
Game Boy Advance (Pac-Man Collection)
SNES (Pac-Man 2 Arcade)
SEGA Genesis (Pac-Man 2 Arcade)
and on older and Modern Systems in Compilations.

The NES Series for GBA showed us what certain Games were like on the NES , which was likely where you would get the best Ports for that time. The ""problem"" people have with this is the fact that the NES Port of Pac-Man wasn't explosively different from the Port already available on Pac-Man Collection.

But , seriously , you guys are starting to sound like IGN.

You complain if a Port of Pac-Man is too different (Atari 2600) , but then you ALSO complain the Port is too similar , claiming it's already available! So this Game is already doomed , even though it is amazing.

I personally own a Front-Loading NES and Pac-Man for it (the one Published by Tengen) and , I must say , for once , a Game on the Game Boy Advance has been perfectly Ported.

The only differences are that the Tengen Logos have been replaced with Namco Logos , but the NES Cartridge published by Namco likely had this. Also , the part that explains who the Ghosts are and there character , there is a small difference from the Port released by Tengen. But , it also could have been that way on the Namco-released Cartridge.

Everything has been perfectly Ported , more-or-less , but there's also 2 Extra Menus that can be accessed by holding L and R Bumpers/Triggers (one at the Main Menu , and one when the Game is Paused , displaying ""Player [1/2] Ready!"" , or when a Cutscene is showing). Even the Ghost Patterns seem to be exact. There's still the slowly-rising Main Menu , the transparent Ghost Eyes (For example , if one Ghost floats over another , you will see one or the other's color through the Ghosts' Eyes).

I truly love what Nintendo/Namco has done here. A GBA Port of the NES Port of Pac-Man? That is an amazing idea. Honestly , if they would do something like this with the Atari 2600 Version , people could see how different they were and how it still retained the fun factor. 'Course , people would probably complain about that too.

I hope you guys understand this Review and see how truly amazing this Game is. If you can get it for a good price , you oughta give it a shot.

Thanks for reading , GOD BLESS!!",5.0

"In this game, you can build your own dream park with lots of rollar coaster, shops, merry-go-round, beautiful games, etc. You can design your own rollar coaster with any colour and can design your own park.

You can build a non-finish rollar coaster and then start it, when the rollar-coaster-car reach there, it will throw away and 'BOMB', all the people in the car will die immediately!

"Lets face it the last 2 call of duty titles  (advanced warfare and ghost) were the worst of the series. This one is a keeper, the jet pack system is a supplement to the game not the main focus. You can wall run like something out of a matrix movie. You will find most levels are not very big and most action is close up and personal. There is a lot of vertical movement in the map designs which utilize the jet pack ability. Overall the multilayer game is refreshing and the graphics are great.

First time loaded up into your system you are greeted with a 2.5 Gb patch and the servers have been laggy in addition to adding too many people for the lobby to handle.  The zombie mode puts you into a lobby of way more that should be in the lobby, i have been in 16 player lobbies when only 4 should be able to join.

First few days of a game usually have some kinks, you impatient customers wana throw a fit when things don't go right. Relax and give it some time.",5.0
"This game is not without its minor issues. Such as trying to jump from building to building to find schematics for combos can me a bit tricky. Sometimes zombies don't load properly and there are a few hiccups.

Other than those few things I could not stop playing this game. I beat it 3 times within the first few weeks of launch and have completed pretty much everything (minus the challenges that require you to kill several hundred thousand zombies) and I could beat it another 3 times with a friend. I thought the first two games were great but this one is massive, hundreds if not thousands of zombies on the screen at any one time. The combo weapons and vehicles are hilarious. The new Survivor system is awesome. No longer are the survivors totally helpless and a pain to save. Multiple safe houses make it easy to save lives.

The only thing I would have liked to see is more Psycho battles. There seemed to be more time to get things done than previous games but most of the time I was just wandering. Overall this is one of my favorite next gen games and I'm sure with DLC it will stay that way.",5.0
"A few reviews complain of limited ammo. Yes, whille this is true, it is the very point of the game.  When you run out of ammo, you find a pipe, a piece of wood, a wrench, theres all kinds of things to pick up, and you go in and get close and personal. THAT is the thrill of the game.

When  you do get a gun, you don't take it for granted, you savor your ammo.  You save it for a rainy day.

I can't play this game alone.  You *shouldn't* play this game alone.  Although the box says one player game, it is not, in my opinion.  At my sister's graduation party, playing it I had a room full of people terrified yet being pulled more and more into the game.  This is something not to be wasted.  Play this game with a room full of people.  The screams of the audience just help to pull you deeper.  This is when to play the game.

"In the late 80's, Nintendo ruled the world with its NES. Countless games had been released and created many memories for gamers around the world. The Mega Man series were running full steam thanks to the underground buzz of Mega Man and the breakout success of Mega Man 2. Revered for the classic shoot and jump game play, memorable Robot Masters and awesome music, the games were a joy to play through and Capcom had to keep up with the demand for more Mega Man games. After releasing a Mega Man title for the Game Boy, they headed back to the drawing board for 1990's Mega Man 3. It was at that point that many felt (including myself) the NES Mega Man series reached the highest point.

The story for Mega Man 3 goes like this: After being defeated twice, Dr. Wily decides to be a good guy and help Dr. Light create a new peace keeping robot for their world. In order for it to be fully powered, they send Mega Man to get energy crystals. Just as he leaves for his journey, robots go crazy and threaten to halt the introduction of the new robot. Now, Mega Man had to get the energy crystals and find out why the robots went crazy. Of course, in the end, Dr. Wily was behind the commotion and stole the robot so he can use it to take over the world. Surely, Mega Man stopped him......and found out that he had a brother, Proto Man.

The premise of Mega Man 3 is the same as the previous two entries: Choose one stage out of eight stages filled with enemies and a Robot Master. Get the special weapons from all Robot Masters by completing all eight stages. Next, you moved on to the next set of stages (four ""Doc Robot"" levels where you face off against robots ""possessed"" by the spirits of the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.) Finally, after you clear one extra stage, you reach Dr. Wily's castle and this time it was made up of six stages. By the time you beat the game, you would have played through 19 stages, the most in a Mega Man game out of the entire NES series. There were new additions first introduced to the NES Mega Man series: the ability to slide through narrow gaps between walls, Mega Man's new sidekick (Rush the robot dog) who came with his own adapters that transformed him into various objects, the ability to save up to nine energy tanks and Proto Man, Mega Man's brother who first appeared in disguise as Break Man to test Mega Man. The password system returned to help save your progress so you can continue your game later.

The PROS: Mega Man 3 perfected everything that the Mega Man games were known for: a good story, excellent graphics, superb music, good sound effects, perfect controls and a difficulty level that wasn't too easy nor was it too overbearing. Capcom hit all the right notes with new Robot Masters (for the first time one of them was based on an animal, portraying a hint of what has yet to come), new stage layouts, appearances from Mega Man 2's Robot Masters, new abilities, new characters and the longest Mega Man game to grace the NES.

The CONS: While it was mentioned in the story, you never ever picked up the energy crystals so it was kind of weird. Some gamers noticed that with this game, the Robot Masters were more prone to receive damage because they didn't have a grace period between hits. This was weird to see but it was just a small fraction against the game since you still had to memorize the robot's attack pattern and avoid touching it.

Many gamers agreed that Mega Man 3 was another fun game to play starring the Blue Bomber. It sold very well and ensured that we would see him again. There are good reasons that Mega Man 3 in particular was and is still fondly remembered. All you have to do is play the game. For Mega Man fans, it was awesome. If you weren't a fan by the time it was released, then this game wouldn't sway your opinion. For those who missed out on any of the NES games, you did miss out. Get yourself a copy of this game through any of these methods: the actual cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection disk (PS2 or GC) or download this game for the Wii from the Virtual Console Cartridge for US $5.00 (500 points.) Any way you choose is worth it. I highly recommend it.",5.0

"Yes, you heard me. Final Fantasy VII...
...is
...NOT...
...overrated.

Stay with me for a minute though. That's not to say the game is perfect. Final Fantasy VII is not the Citizen Kane of video games. There are games out there with better stories and better characters. And in terms of gameplay, it's certainly not the best JRPG ever made, either. One could argue that the party size's reduction from four to three members streamlines the battle system, but a pessimist (or purist) might call it a detrimental simplification. After all, the last time a Final Fantasy game made the leap to a new, more powerful platform (Final Fantasy IV), they increased the party size and introduced the ATB mechanic. The only thing this game's battle system introduces are Limit Breaks, and those aren't even really new. The Materia system is a dumbed-down retooling of Final Fantasy VI's Magicite/Relic setup, and helps to make Final Fantasy VII the only installment aside from III to make differences between party members virtually nonexistent. In the first and fourth games, characters were set apart by the skills and attributes tied to their classes, which could sometimes be upgraded but never changed. Party members in the second and fifth installments start out virtually identical, but gradually evolved into distinct characters with exclusive capabilities as the game commences. Final Fantasy VI combines these two approaches by pairing set character classes with Magicite and Relics. In Final Fantasy VII, however, Limit Breaks are the ONLY major difference between characters, and with a few exceptions, most of them do the same thing.

But as I was saying, Final Fantasy VII is NOT OVERRATED. But it IS over-hyped, and often for the wrong reasons.

My initial impression of Final Fantasy VII was slack-jawed stupefaction at how incredible it looked. Today's gamers who are accustomed to BioShock, Odin Sphere, and HDTV consoles with 1080p or 4K display might scoff at the comparatively blocky and clunky graphics of Final Fantasy VII's iconic opening FMV. But in 1997-- back when FMV itself was still a novelty and kind of a big deal-- the general reception of the first two minutes of Final Fantasy VII was eye-popping astonishment. I can almost guarantee that anybody who played Final Fantasy VII when it was first released-- even people who bash it now, as FFVII-deprecation becomes more and more in vogue with the upcoming PS4 remake-- was shocked into silence during the game's first half-hour. Even if their interest tapered off further into the game, I don't think many players can honestly say the their first hectic glimpse into Final Fantasy VII's world didn't knock them off their feet. If Final Fantasy IV's dynamic opening sequence was pretty impressive to players who grew up with the series 8-bit iterations, Final Fantasy VII's introduction was nothing short of mind-blowing.

Before moving on with the graphics, let's examine what most people consider the games' greatest narrative strength (and why they're incorrect).

~THE CAST~
The game centers largely around a group called AVALANCHE (yes, it's officially spelled with capital letters, and no, nobody knows what it's supposed to be an acronym for) which was originally a terroristic cabal founded and led by Barret to combat the global energy conglomerate Shinra, Inc. After undergoing a drastic roster change and getting drawn into the events regarding Shinra, Sephiroth, and the search for the fabled Promised Land, AVALANCHE changes its mission. In addition to saving the planet from Shinra's economic stranglehold and planetary life essence-sucking Mako reactors, it is resolved to find Sephiroth and put a stop to his mysterious designs, at which point the leadership reins are passed from Barret to the main character, Cloud.

Cloud Strife is one of the most recognizable faces in video games today, in addition to wielding one of video games' most iconic weapons. He is also a snarky jerk, certifiably insane, and, in true JRPG protagonist fashion, is better than everyone else in the world at everything, including snowboarding, chocobo riding, and sustaining multiple shotgun blasts to the face. Even with a more mature perspective, I still can't help liking Cloud. He remains consistently interesting all the way up to Act 3, which is about when he loses the attitude, sorts out his mental luggage, and become another vanilla JRPG hero. The big revelation regarding his identity in Act 2 is right on par with FFVI villain Kefka and his apocalyptic hijinks as one of the most genuinely shocking twists in a video game narrative.

Barret Wallace, the original leader of Final Fantasy VII's most notorious terrorist group, is portrayed with a boisterous, short-tempered disposition that often comes just short of racial caricature. It also doesn't really help that he's constantly outdone by everyone's favorite spiky-headed Aryan every five minutes. All things considered, he's treated pretty fairly when compared to someone like Sazh from FFXIII, and remains one of the most likeable characters in the game. He's more human than Cloud, less whiny than Vincent, and not as much of a misogynistic bastard as Cid.

The other initial AVALANCHE member is Tifa Lockhart, Cloud's childhood pal, expert martial artist, and Midgar bar hostess. She spends most of Act 1 pulling on Cloud's left arm, trying to wrench him away from Aerith, who has him by his right. She bothers me today for the same reason I don't fancy Celes in FFVI the same way I used to. For the greatest martial artist on the planet, Tifa proves totally incapable of taking care of herself when Cloud isn't around. There's a scene in Act 2 in which Barret chides her for falling completely apart over Cloud's absence. I appreciated that line as something of a little self-aware nod the game made about itself. But then I remembered in Act 3 how Tifa spouted the exact same line as Rosa did back in Final Fantasy IV: ""I WILL REMAIN BY YOUR SIDE BECAUSE NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN TO ME WHEN I'M WITH YOU!!"" And then I cringe.

Joining them is Aerith Gainsborough, best know for being the Final Fantasy chick who dies. Aerith is a flower girl from the slums who also happens to be the very last of the Ancients-- until she is murdered by Sephiroth. Though she is fully dedicated to AVALANCHE's new cause, Aerith seems a lot more interested in her passive-aggressive duel with Tifa for Cloud's affections, which she loses by default when she dies. Her affection for Cloud party stems from his peculiar resemblance to her old boyfriend Zack, who is dead, just like Aerith is by the end of the first disc. Unfortunately, Aerith never finds out the full story behind Cloud and Zack, because Sephiroth runs his sword through her guts before it comes to light. Before she dies, Aerith sets a plot device in motion that becomes the Planet's only hope for stopping Meteor. And then she dies.

(The previous paragraph may have contained minor spoilers, by the way.)

The rest of the cast isn't nearly as extensively developed as other reviews would have you believed. Red XIII's only real function in the plot is to get the party to Cosmo Canyon, and I'm willing to be Square created him almost entirely as an excuse to demonstrate that their new 3D modeling witchery could be used to make all kinds of new player characters possible. Cait Sith barely contributes any more than Red XIII does (Can someone explain to me what exactly is supposed to be happening to him in the Temple of the Ancients? Did he somehow gain sentience, or are we seeing Reeve get a little too wrapped up in his performance?). Cid is a criminally underused character whose only real purpose is to allow the party access to the airship (god I wish his stint as team leader in Act 2 lasted longer). Depending upon who you ask, Yuffie is either an adorable little scamp, or the most obnoxious brat ever attached to an HP bar, who stars in one single interesting world-building sidequest. And I should probably mention that I have never played Dirge of Cerberus so I have no idea what it has to say regarding Vincent's backstory. But if it isn't revealed within Final Fantasy VII-- as this game was originally conceived to be a totally self-contained story-- then as far as I'm concerned it is irrelevant.

One of the biggest problems I have regarding this game is the primary antagonist, Sephiroth, the most overrated video game character ever-- but I'm jumping the gun. He was once Shinra's top-ranking operative and probably the single most dangerous man on the Planet, who seemed content to dutifully carry out his orders. Two years before the start of the game, events during a routine mission made him question his own origins. He read into it, didn't like what he found, and went insane. At first he sounds like he's sporting an Oedipus complex for his ""mother"", Jenova, whom the reports he uncovers incorrectly identify as an Ancient. Believing himself to be Ancients' heir, Sephiroth resolves to travel with her to the Promised Land and make humanity pay for squandering the Planet the Ancients passed on to them. But sometime between then and the start of the game he abandons the whole ""Mother!"" shtick, forgets about the Ancients and the Promised Land, and decides he wants to become a god by dropping a giant rock on the world and absorbing the energy gathered by the planet to heal its wound. Why the change of heart? NOBODY KNOWS!

No one knows what his motives are. He spends the entire game frozen in a crystal while his black-coat flunkies and Jenova's severed pieces do everything for him. He rips off Kefka's fallen angel performance. And not to sound even more nitpicky, but wasn't his plan to be at the center of the planet's Meteor-inflicted wound, because that's where the energy will be gathering? Meteor is hovering over Midgar. Sephiroth is stuck underground in a crystal at the north pole. Is this a tremendous oversight on Sephiroth's part, or does he have some other power I'm not aware of because the game never bothered telling me? Ambiguity is one thing, plot inconsistencies are another. You should not have to consult the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega Guide and/or retconning DVD releases to have this stuff clarified.

What makes this worse is that this game wasted a truly engaging and frightening antagonist in Jenova in favor of this guy. Even though Jenova is the single most important figure in the story she ends up playing second fiddle to a pretty boy in a black cape. Maybe it's just the Lovecraft fan in me, but an ancient cosmic being whose undying cells can eventually reunite and bring it back to life, and who can manipulate humans to its own insidious, unfathomable ends by projecting illusions and false memories into their minds seems like a much more deserving of the ""primary antagonist"" designation than Norman Bates with prettier hair and a longer knife.

But moving on...

~LOCATIONS~
Final Fantasy VII's character models, overworld map, and battle scenes are now three-dimensional, but the series hasn't fully made the leap into 3D just yet. The town and dungeon maps may no longer be made up of flat, tiled grids, but they're all still two-dimensional. The 32-bit Final Fantasy games are unique for their pre-rendered environments. Whereas the 8- and 16-bit games' environments were confined to tilesets and the more recent installments are still limited to a finite number of textures and skins that can be displayed at once, the only limitations on the PlayStation-era games' environments were what could be produced with a pen and the artists imagination.

The greatest narrative strength of Final Fantasy VII isn't its characters or plot. It's the SETTING. The player might be controlling Cloud, whom the game's events revolve around, but more often than not Cloud is just a tiny purple and yellow speck on the screen as he makes his way through a gigantic Mako reactor or trudges through a sweeping stretch of wilderness. The Planet itself is Final Fantasy VII's star, thrust into the center stage by the game's immense beautifully-rendered environments.

Here's a list of-- in this fan's humble opinion-- the game's seven more memorable locations. #1 should come as a surprise to absolutely nobody.

7.) The Great Glacier
The largest ""dungeon"" in the game (this place is HUGE), and the farthest away from Midgar Final Fantasy VII takes you before handing you an airship and making you revisit the places you've already been. Barret, likely delirious from hypothermia, goes off on a tangent about how the northern tundra is like the antithesis of Midgar, and I think he's on to something. The path of Cloud's journey to find Sephiroth begins in a place that has been totally co-opted by humanity, and ends here: in a pristine wilderness completely under nature's domain, where humans are incapable of sustaining themselves for long. I guess the message here is that what's most desirable is a middle ground between the two.

6.) Cosmo Canyon
Ah, hello there middle ground. I'd guess Cosmo Canyon is more than a little derived from an idealized portrait of the American Southwest and its indigenous peoples. But in any case, it's what every commune wishes it could be, and in all honesty, it's where I'd be posting this from if it actually existed. The jolly and wise Bugenhagen most represents the place's spirit: humanity, nature, and technology existing in balance.

5.) Wutai
Forced to disarm after its humiliating defeat in a war with Shinra fifteen years ago, Wutai now peddles its ancient and unique culture to tourists from the very lands that defeated them. It is a land of many deities, but most of its inhabitants no longer believe in them as strongly than they used to. Much generation friction exists in Wutai over the war and adherence to custom and tradition. Wutai is also full of pagodas, ninja, and giant Buddha statues. If you haven't already guessed that this place is an almost perfect analogue to Japan (and most of Southeast Asia), well...

4.) Nibleheim
Cloud and Tifa's hometown seems more like the setting of a psychological horror film than a JRPG village. Nibelheim is where you'd end up if you took a wrong exit while driving to Silent Hill. It's the backdrop for Final Fantasy VII's most disturbing events and lies at the very core of Cloud's delusions. Even scarier is the notion that somebody could watch their neighborhood burning and their friends and family slaughtered, then come back two years later to find everything standing exactly as it was before, populated by strangers who insist nothing ever happened.

3.) The Forgotten City
In keeping with the H.P. Lovecraft references, this place is hugely reminiscent of At the Mountains of Madness and The Shadow Out of Time. The utterly alien City of the Ancients is deserted, bewildering, and more than a little unnerving in its strangeness (a quality enhanced by its ominous exclusive BGM). This place is a cornucopia of mystery, and everyone who might have been capable of unlocking all its secrets is dead. The Forgotten City has a kind of eldritch beauty about it that makes you glad to depart and reluctant to return. Even modern 128-bit games have trouble being this atmospheric.

2.) The Gold Saucer
Glitzy and gimmicky, often cheesy, and always expensive, the Gold Saucer is Final Fantasy VII's Disneyland. There isn't a Square fan on the planet who can't identify the Gold Saucer theme within three notes, as most of them have spent more hours here than anywhere else in the game. It was awfully considerate of Square to consolidate virtually all of Final Fantasy VII's minigames and endgame sidequests into one (semi-) convenient location. It is curious, though, how the Planet's premier playground for rich people is located right above its largest prison and can only be reached by first passing through the world's most poorest and most destitute region. Some sort of masked commentary, perhaps, or just a coincidence?

1.) Midgar
I said you wouldn't be surprised. Midgar IS Final Fantasy VII. It's as much a cyberpunk's idealized city as Blade Runner's Los Angeles, only Blade Runner doesn't give you the freedom to explore the city on your own. When most people discuss what they remember or enjoy most about Final Fantasy VII, the answer more often than not pertains to Midgar. It's also no coincidence that the game gradually becomes less engaging as you are lead farther and farther away from the city, then picks up again once the party leaves the Northern Crater and starts getting drawn back towards it.

Most pre-1997 console RPGs and adventure games' prevalent themes were along the lines of ""power of hope, love and friendship"", ""absolute power corrupts"", ""elemental"" crystals, mystical jewels, and/or mana seeds are best left alone"", with the occasional, ""hey, don't trust Christianity."" Most of these games took place in medieval storybook lands inhabited by elves, knights, fairies, dragons, princesses, and talking trees, and their stories were usually about a small band of misfits defeating an evil wizard or king so the world could live happily ever after and abolish all wars forever. Then we get to the PlayStation era. Final Fantasy VII might not quite be that generation's ""Great Gatsby"", but it captures turn-of-the-century Zeitgeist like no previous game could and which few games have been able to surpass.

Evil empires are a mainstay of RPGs and adventure games. To most gamers, they are things of the distant past. So Final Fantasy VII gives us Shinra, a mega-conglomerate that has dominated the world's market to such an overwhelming degree that it has become the Planet's most influential entity. Shinra is technically nothing more than a business firm operating in (what appears to be) a capitalist system, and yet it has grown so powerful that it has superseded the government of the country in which it has based, takes over other cities (like Junon), and even maintains its own military force. I'll assume you are able to connect the dystopic dots yourself. The themes of this company carry through the rest of the game. Not only does it come complete with it's own evil castle in the form of a corporate high-rise office building, but it's rare to pass a town that doesn't have it's own Mako reactor, indicating that Shinra has the world's energy market in a ball-grip. The parallel's between real-life oil companies on planet Earth are too strong to ignore.

JRPGs and other video games have had environmental messages before (Global Gladiators, anyone?), but Final Fantasy VII is a hardliner on the issue. Bugenhagen explains that the purpose of the White Materia and Holy is to induce the Planet to purge itself of anything threatening it. This not only means it will repel Meteor, but a very real possibility exists that humanity will be erased in the process. I'm used to hearing poets and environmentalists tell me that the world would be glad to see us gone, but this is some pretty heavy stuff coming from a video game.

One of Final Fantasy VII's outspoken messages is that a post-industrial society like Midgar's (which isn't such a far cry from the cities of today) is degrading to the human spirit. Midgar is spreading. The blight to the land inflicted by its Mako reactors creeps outwards, and Shinra's economic and technological influence is changing civilization. The old ways of life are dying out as more people adopt Mako technology and conform to Shinra's ways. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, technology's role in human life continues to grow unchecked, and a whole lot of people are getting concerned about the globalization trend. If there's a point Final Fantasy VII is making somewhere at the heart of its labyrinthine story, it's that such developments are not in people's best interests. Once again, this isn't the kind of statement you'd expect from a video game back in 1997, especially coming from the folks whose company name you probably last saw stamped on Secret of Evermore and Super Mario RPG.

All of this and I've hardly gone over the gameplay at all. What is there to say? Its battle and party development mechanics are fun, even if sometimes a little too simple. The thing is, thanks to the PlayStation's better hardware and new format, Final Fantasy VII offers a much more multifaceted experience than its predecessors-- an experience whose ATB battles and character maintenance are overshadowed by its other aspects. Final Fantasy VI performed a successful balancing act between gameplay and narrative, even if the scales occasionally tipped more towards narrative. If the last Final Fantasy on the SNES marked a change in direction, then Final Fantasy VII was a wild sprint in that new direction. It builds on much of what made VI successful, but somewhere along the line, the balance was totally thrown off. Final Fantasy VII is about narrative. The battles are fun, but they are certainly not what sold over 11 million copies.

I don't think Final Fantasy VII is overrated. Almost twenty years later, it's still the game every JRPG tries to be. It actually broke the genre. It now exists as a standard that cannot possibly be met. The next successful JRPG will be the one that manages to break as much ground, sell as many copies, and stir up as much of a popular and critical tidal, and that's about as likely as Street Fighter V resurrecting the American arcade scene. In other words, at our current trend it's probably never going to happen.

Ignore the hype. Final Fantasy VII isn't perfect. Don't expect perfection, because you shouldn't anyway. For better or worse, this is one of the titles that helped push video games into their current identity crisis. It was a forward stride in the evolution of a genre and a medium, and the next step will occur when the genre is able to get past it.

So, Final Fantasy VII gets a perfect score. For all its imperfections and hype, it offers too memorable and inimitable a trip to deserve anything less.",5.0

"we are flooded by FPSs these days but this game stands out from the crowd. The graphics are exceptional and while the story is pulpy the environments are very well designed maximizing the carnage for everyone`s pleasure. The designers really spent a long time programming the game`s sceneries, making it well worth your hard earned cash. The expansion Reborn is tougher (yet short) and it`s worth picking up as well-cheap these days.
As we gamers say, `gg`, a good game.",5.0

"It is very fair to say that Syberia was the game that got me back into adventure games.  I picked it up off the shelves on a whim shortly after it was released, thinking that it looked like a good game, but half expecting it to be a mildly dissapointing experience.  People have been saying that the adventure game genre is dead, but that is most certainly not the case.  Syberia was an amazing accomplishment, as much a piece of art as it was a game.  Given from what I've seen of this sequel, I have no doubt in my mind that this one is going to astound and amaze me as much as the first did.  If you're feeling depressed about adventure games, play this series.  Then you'll just feel depressed about there not being a Syberia III to look forward to.
The sequel is in some ways shorter and easier than the first one, but the writing and graphics were immersive enough that I found it difficult to hold it against the game.  After all, it didn't prevent me from moving the story on, which was all I really cared about after a while.  And even though it is a sequel, it is easily capable of standing on its own (but shame on you if you haven't at least tried to get your hands on the original first).
The music in my opinion exceeds the original in many ways, and instead of an endless loop it comes on only sparingly, though I wouldn't have minded if there had been a bit more of it.
The story is artfully executed and greatly enhanced by the use of the pre-rendered cinematics, evoking enough emotion to actually bring tears to my eyes in several places.  Yes, there are a few factual errors concerning penguins, but there are factual errors in just about everything these days, and if necessary their presence in the North could be explained by a well meaning but fairly dim zoo keeper trying to return his charges to the wild.  The fact that it is short in no way cheapens the game play, as it would have been a crime to try to draw out the plot, which is always at the forefront of the game, any further as it would only have ruined the story.  Also, strong performances help bring every character in the game to life.
In short, brilliant acting, cinematography, writing, and visual aspects all help this game live up to its astounding predecessor.  If you're a fan of old style adventure games, you simply have to play this series before giving up on the genre.
Even shorter: PLAY THIS GAME.",5.0

"I already own a fat PS3 and since it is in my living and my family uses it for Netflix i bought this so i could have it in my room. I don't see why people are slamming it with bad reviews.....it's a normal PS3 just smaller...if you bought it thinking it had better graphics are a better processor you are a moron, seriously. Everybody is saying ""It's cheap, it feels cheap"" What do you sit there and feel up your PS3? It just sits there and plays games so why does it matter? It has a nice design and since i have it on my computer desk it's a nice fit and size for a PS3. I personally like the simplicity but as always there are cry baby's and bring down things for no reason when they are perfectly fine.

Some have even been crying about the sound. This thing is quiet as a mouse, especially with your TV on it's unnoticeable unless you literally sit with your ear next to it. Mind you it's on my computer desk hooked to my monitor so it's literally like 4 inches away from me and i don't hear it.

In short if you want a new PS3 this is the way to go, small, good price for what it comes with, good design all that good normal PS3 stuff.",5.0

So I am quite saddened that this company no longer will be doing these games the Dark siders games are such a wonderful addition to my ps3 collection. However I must say that I prefer the second Dark siders over this one because I enjoy the story line a bit more. It is quite sad to see the 1 and 2 star reviews because honestly this is such a great game ad I play GOW and Prince Of Persia and yes there are a LOT of similarities and that is why I also enjoyed this game so much!,5.0

"More and more lately there have been great AAA games available for the DS, and quite a few of them are more adult oriented than the usual kiddie fare. This game is sweet! Offering quite a bit of sophistication for the system and displaying some of the best graphics seen to date on the DS, the story will also hook you and pull you into the world of Altair, a much feared assassin. I've never felt so immersed on such a small screen. I feel like I AM Altair every time I play this. Excellent!",5.0
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting the Audio Controller with this.
I always boost my Bass and Treble, so the Settings I used were Preset 4, Surround mode 4 on the audio controller.

- Microphone is very clear. With the Audio Controller, you can adjust the input/output microphone on the fly.
- Great design, feels great on my head, not heavy, very comfortable for long gaming hours
- Cross-platform, Xbox, Playstation, PC
- Very well made, EXCEPT for the little orange rings that other reviewers mention. They're right above the ear cushions. They seem a little flimsy, so just don't go dropping it too many times. I've probably dropped my headset about 10 times so far from 3 1/2 feet, no issues yet.

I can't think of anything negative at all, except those little orange rings",5.0

"This game is going to be on my hard drive for a long, long time.  The only thing it lacks is a random map generator, which I think will be added in a patch or an add-on later.  If you're a turn-based strategy fan, this game  is a must have.  It blows Heroes of Might and Magic (an already superb  series) out of the water with more detail, better combat, and just plain  better everything (even better MUSIC, which was very hard to beat!).
If  you don't love this game, you're not a gamer.  (Either that or you're just  a twitch gamer, which is allmost as bad. :-)
In all my years of PC  gaming, this is my favorite turn-based game (tops Master of Magic and even  X-COM! those two games held the ""longest on hard drive"" awards up  until this one came along, and I know it will unseat them).  It might  actually be my favorite game of all time, bar-none, but that remains to be  seen in the test of time.

"I was sitting in my discrete math class one day and had this Urge to Play a Sim City, this was really odd.  I was looking online for the Original Sim City.  You know the one, everything was black and white, residential buildings where Labeled with an R, while Commercial sectors where Labeled C.  I later discovered you could play it online for free, so I did not buy it.  However I did find Sim City 4, and Wow, it was a shock, it was amazing what Will Wright has done with this Genre.  Zooming in on my little happy city (Bob Ross reference) there were cars with headlights driving around!  And not to mention all the people walking around!  It wasn't long before i started to wonder what these simple pixelated city inhabitants where having for breakfast, before their long commute from the residential peninsula to Commercial Boulevard, where they work at their white collar job to feed their pixelated families.

"I loved Hot Shots for PS2, so this was the first game I bought when I picked up my PSP.  I was at first a little disappointed in that I had to win items rather than buying them, but it works out well as there are just too many costume pieces/equipment upgrades to keep track of.  There is a large enough assortment of characters to make playing a new experience each time, especially with all the outfitting combinations.

I have several PSP games now, but constantly find myself popping them out to squeeze in just one or two short courses for fun.  Each course has its own pros and cons, but the Dino Park course is so maddening that you feel compelled to return to it even though it frustrates the daylights out of you.

I have yet to experience any freezes in game play like I have with other games (Battlefront II, Lord of the Rings:Tactics), and the graphics are as tight as the full-size console versions.

If you're looking for a game with a high replay factor that you may want to occasionally hand off to a kid to keep them quiet for a while, this is the game to get.  Easy to learn, always a way to challenge yourself.",5.0

Filled with the charming art that makes me love Square-Enix, and a unique story and game dynamics The World Ends With You is one of a kind. A game that truly shows the capability of the ds. Once you've played it you'll never forget it. Neku and his friends will have you fighting to win the ""reaper game.""",5.0
"This game sat on my shelf for many months while I played GTA4. I didn't even realize it was made by the same company, so when I got around to playing it I felt like a fool for not playing it sooner. Red Dead Redemption has one of the best stories I have ever experienced. It is on par with Hollywood movie writing in my humble opinion. I have replayed it many times and eventually will again. The western setting is pristine and I wonder why it hadn't been done before, except of course for the predecessor Red Dead Revolver. Revolver was a very linear game but enjoyable. Redemption is basically GTA western style and the quality is no less an achievement than Rockstars' other blockbuster games. I love this game and recommend it highly.",5.0

"This is my first fighting stick, and so far I haven't had any problems whatsoever. The fight stick should be used for fighting games, such as, MK vs DC Universe, Soul Calibur 4, and of course with any Street Fighter game. I feel relieved that I don't have to use PS3 controllers anymore, because it's easier to do combos and my thumb doesn't hurt anymore.

 FYI, when you insert the Street Fighter 4 disc into your PS3 make sure you go to -> ""Options"" -> ""System Settings"" -> ""Install. This will improve load times and online play.

I was fortunate to get this FightStick at retail price($149), because I pre-order this product in early December. However, it's unfortunate when third party sellers are trying to sell the Street Fighter IV tournament FightStick at triple or quadruple from the original price. If MadCatz decide not to make anymore I recommend to look elsewhere. For example, I believe Hori came out with the Playstation 3 Real Arcade Pro. 3 Fighting Stick, or a company called, Arcade-in-a-box. I heard both of these company's fight sticks are well made--do a Google search.

Having said that, this is a top quality stick and you won't be disappointed.",5.0
Very impressed with this product. The batteries last a really long time and they charge very quickly. We were so impressed we actually ordered another set. The kids love playing on the Wii and Wii U. This saves a lot of money on batteries. I would highly recommend this product. We have Wii brand we bought almost 5 years ago and they do not last as long as these do. The charging stations also charge much faster. I would recommend this to everyone and plan on purchasing a few more in the future as each kid has their own Wii and set of controllers. We would like to have rechargeable batteries for every controller.,5.0

"I played this game in early 2016, nearly a year after it came out in May 2015.
I had never played The Witcher or The Witcher 2. But I had seen and heard about them.
So there I was, I dusted off my copy of The Witcher 3 and read a little bit of the basic plot from the previous 2 games on several wiki sites.
Read about the choices to be made in those games, the main characters and was ready to go.
I loaded up the game, watched the intro, and began what was my play through of one of the most gorgeous, engaging and immersive gaming experiences I have ever had.
Learning the gameplay and controls, and combat, and leveling up was a bit tricky, The game is so huge. It is like an Elder Scrolls game in the sense that it can be a little overwhelming at first. (Its 20% bigger than Skyrim)
But I kept playing, and inevitably, I quickly became addicted.

66 Achievements, 4503 kills, 205 deaths, and 295 hours later. I had finished The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt along both of the fantastic and well priced DLCs.

This game won the overall Game of The Year award in 2015.
The Polish developer is the small and humble CD Projekt Red, which also won Developer of the Year in 2015
The story is based on the series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.

The Witcher 3 had a total budget cost of $81 million USD. For perspective, GTA V cost $265 million, and Destiny cost upwards of $500 million (including the marketing involved).
This is a incredible accomplishment from a small developer in Poland with 370 employees, which has only made 2 games prior to The Witcher 3.

The characters, game environments, in-game details, the controls and combat, the looting system, the writing and dialog, the story and the fast traveling and menu are all so well done it is hard to put this game down.
Geralt of Rivia is one of the most badass and likable characters of any game I have played.
Right up there with Master Chief and Commander Sheppard.
The Witcher 3 is one of those games I picked up just because it looked good with the graphics, but in the end, it was one of the best I have ever played overall.
The Witcher 3 is one of those games that has made a history for itself in the videogame industry.
The Witcher 3 is one of those games you will never forget.
Still to this day, a year has gone by since I finished it. And two years since its release.

It is in my opinion, still the best game you can play on the Xbox One or Playstation 4, if you haven't already.",5.0

"This is the absolute best game on PS2. I've always wanted to play a realistic espionage game for a console system, and this is it. OK, there's a little bit of unrealism, but most of it can happen. The story is that Solid Snake gets news that there's a new type of Metal Gear, which is amphibous, and he must get photographic evidence. That's all i'm gonna say about the story, since there are so many twists. The sneaking behind walls is great, and so is the 1st person view. There are some great stratigies in this game to get around people. Rolling, hiding in a locker, firing a fire extinguisher, strangling, and just plain shooting. Also, the graphics are great.

"Replaced a Razer Naga that I owned and died due to a static zap, after a few years of use.  It has more customization when it comes to weight, compared to my 1st edition Naga.  I like the ridges on the buttons on side of the mouse it makes locating the number you need easier and without a sticker or something, compared to Razers design.  Its very well designed the lighting is cool looking, and color is changeable.  I am very happy with it and its cheaper than the Naga.  I recommend this mouse",5.0
Just perfect!! I bought this as a training aid while working towards my private pilots license. a lot has been said on whether using a game simulation is good or not. I don't have any notion that a simulation is going to replace actually flying but where it shines is training your mind for what you need to be doing during your flight. Monitoring your gauges is the same as if you were actually in a real plane. What the plane does according to your input is the same. Throttle back and you start to descend. Throttle forward and you climb. Same with trim. All these things you have to mentally be thinking of. This all came together yesterday when I was up on a training run. I havnt been up flying since I bought this. But I have been doing simulation flights. I found that after mentally training my mind on what I need to be doing while in the cockpit. I was much more at ease when actually in a real plane.,5.0

I found the ""trick"" levels more fun than the ""racing"" levels, but they both had their certain highpoints. The game is appropriate for younger kids, but is great fun for adults. The game has plenty of replay, and is a good investment.",5.0
"Heavy Rain is easily one of the greatest games I've ever played. Simply put. It's unlike anything else you have ever played. You play as four different characters; Madison Page, a journalist that is very interested in the origami case, Scott Shelby, a retired detective that has made somewhat of a comeback to help with the origami killer case, Ethan Mars, the father of the child who gets kidnapped by the origami killer, and Norman Jayden, a cop who is thrown right in the middle of the origami killer case.
The game plays out in different sections mixed together beautifully. It starts out very slowly, but it will really help you feel connected to the characters. The main story is as follows (WARNING! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS): After a tragic accident where Ethan Mars' son, Jayden gets killed by running out into the middle of the street and is struck by a car, Ethan divorces his wife. Things go down from here as it's reported that the Origami Killer has claimed his eighth victim. Ethan takes his other son, Sean, to the park. After Sean wants to ride the carousel, Ethan wanders off and is unable to find Sean. It is later implied that Sean has been kidnapped by the Origami Killer. Ethan now has to complete five trials, ranging from driving in oncoming traffic on the freeway, to cutting off a section of finger, to killing another man, to get the clues to where his son is.
The story is incredibly deep and quite disturbing at moments. It's a very mature game, that at moments will shock you and make you feel unsettled and sometimes even scared. The characters are all great, though one feels a bit weaker and less fun to play as than the others. There are characters that you will meet that are incredibly messed up and drive the story even further.
The best way to describe this game is an interactive movie. It's a very story-driven game. You will be able to control almost every aspect of the game, and the decisions you make will greatly impact the way the game ends. There are roughly 20 different endings, and it will take you a long time to see all of them, though I don't recommend it. I played all the way through the game twice, both played out very differently, and after the second play through, I felt like I wasn't playing as the characters I played as in the first play through.
This game is easily one of the greatest I've ever played. I'm not one for trying to enjoy deep stories, but this had me hooked from beginning to end. It's incredibly immersive, depressing, shocking, and beautiful. I couldn't put the controller down. There were times where I played for three hours straight (coming from a person who can't play games for more than an hour on the average day). If you haven't played this game, you need to stop reading this review right now and go pick up a copy.",5.0

"This is my first truck simulator.  I bought TDU2 and all the Need for Speed games, but I really wanted something I could actually drive a LONG distance.  This fits the bill perfectly.  I downloaded this off of Amazon and it's worked like a charm.  I skipped all the other truck sims because they looked hokey with graphics designed by a 10 year old.  This one, however, is awesome.  Im only on the 'Newbie' level lol, and I'm saving money to buy a really nice truck.  It works great with my wheel too.  The only thing worth mentioning is that it took a while to get the graphics right and I hate the narrow streets, but those things are minor.  Also, with everything set on max, frame rates are noticeable, but not a deal breaker.  I have an I7 2400 with a 580 GTX video card and it runs pretty good.  Overall, I would definitely try this if you like driving sims.  P.s.  The simulated weather is great!",5.0

"First of all, I have been a long time MonHunter.
I really don't think I have a big hand however after a long session of hunting, my palm hurts. There are other similar grip products, but if you truly are a Monster Hunter fan, then you must have a Monster Hunter grip. It grips firmly on your hand, Works with US version of New 3DS XL.

I'm not sure if my product is defective or not, the left 1 button feels very loose. When I play laying down, facing the ceiling, sometimes the L1 is pressed by itself. Otherwise playing sitting down works flawlessly and doesn't hurt my palm after a long session.

"I loved this game, and I have played several Adventure Games.  It has the right amount of everything.  You get interaction with characters.  Puzzels, hunting for clues and putting items together.  Story is very well played out, and the spooky factor gives it plenty of interest all the way thru.  Would recommend this game to anyone.",5.0
"No DLC, No Clan Name Registry, No pre-order bonus, Wii u owners treated like second class citizens, yet they still charge full $60 price tag. That just isn't right on so many levels. There is no reason why this could not lower the price to $50 or $40 for the Wii U version since it's so crippled. If they want Nintendo owners to support Activision and other 3rd party developers, you have to treat them fairly and give them value for their hard earned money. Don't charge top dollar for an inferior product. Some companies recognize this a do something about it. When Batman Arkham Origins was released on the WIi u, it did not have online multiplayer, so what did they do? They sold it at $50 instead of $60 and Amazon did the awesome deed of offering an additional $10 Amazon credit for all pre-orders of the Wii u version. That was totally great and fair price at only $40 for the game. I applaud them for doing it since they didn't really need to do it. I wanted to get this game because I really enjoyed Black Ops II on the Wii u, but until the price decreases to a more fair amount and Wii U owners are treated more equally, I will find other entertainment.

Update: Recently got Call of Duty Ghosts for only $40 on Amazon, nice Black Friday deal. The game is much better than expected. Certainly very happy they decided to bring the game to Wii U. Graphics and gameplay are very engaging and fun. Controls feel better than Call of Duty Black ops II. Overall, this is an improvement from all other Call of Duty games. I would recommend for all Wii U owners.",5.0

"Could not wait to get this ever since I saw it was coming out.  Both my kids are avid Basketball players and thought this would really be fun and improve their game.  I can already tell it will. You have to dribble with your head up...100% of the time, look down and your are going to miss something.  I am also VERY impressed with the Kinects ability to tell which hand you are dribbling with, and don't even try to get away with trying to fool the Kinect into believing your crossover was a behind the back dribble...it knows!  The Kinect can tell if you are doing the trick correctly almost 100% of the time.

The game has 3 difficulties (rookie, pro and baller) and you try to time your dribble to the beat with either your right or left hand.  Staggered throughout there are also 'tricks' in between dribble beats that you must perform to get multipliers.  The tricks on rookie are limited to crossovers/around the world,dribble under leg/pump fake and side pass.  Rookie mode is a great warmup, I find Pro to be quite challenging and fun.  There are 30ish tracks and none available yet for download, but I hope some are coming soon.  As long as new tracks keep coming, this game will be in heavy rotation in our house!

FYI- the ball they give you is not ideal, very 'bouncy' and difficult to control.  I thought the ball originally had some sensor or something, but actually you can use any ball.  We use my son's evolution ball and it works great, but any ball would do.",5.0

I haven't played Jake Hunter but I started Ghost Trick right after playing Last Window - two very different mystery stories indeed!

In Ghost Trick, you're desperately seeking clues to your identity before the sun comes up and ends your existence forever - but around every bend is some damn fool getting killed that needs your help, and it quickly becomes apparently that you are going to help these recently departed if you ever want to find out the secrets of your past!

Ghost Trick is very much a spiritual (no pun intended) successor to the Ace Attorney series by the same creator. Quirky characters with spiky hair, high-energy females who love to eat, and a little bit of the super natural tossed in with a rousing mystery at the bottom of it all - this game will really have you hooked! The Ghost Trick puzzle mechanics are a really refreshing type of puzzle, and the story is engaging enough to keep you at it no matter what. Another addictive series, but unfortunately it seems to be only a ""stand-alone"" story line that will keep you guessing until the very end. The first thing I said at the end was ""WHAT THE *BLEEEP*?!?"" immediately followed by ""YOU GOTTA PLAY THIS GAME!!!"" to anyone who would listen! Pick it up now!!",5.0

"This game is just so intresting game to play. Loving the disney characters and a fanatic for the final fantasy series especially FF7. Seeing Cloud in this game was SOOOOOOO..........Cool. Playing as Sora, You travel through the worlds of Disney Characters. Sure the fighting may have gotten a little annoying but you quickly forget about it once you are on your way to the new world you are about go to. Overall, the graphics were SWEET, storyline even better, and the voices along with the intresting atmosphere really made this a great game that should be all gaming collections.

Highly recommended:)",5.0
"I recently purchased an xbox one, and this was one of my initial purchases. Needless to say, I was not disappointed in the least. An open-world zombie game where the player can actually mow through the zombies rather than getting subdued by one or two weak ones. DR3 is the zombie game we as gamers need AND deserve. I bought Dying Light and returned it, and was very let-down. I bought DR3 and have not had one moment of disappointment. The graphics, weapons, sounds, and comic content are all great. This is a must-have title for zombie fans and for those looking for a great title to enjoy.",5.0
"Pros:
Smooth UI/Menu navigation.  Good graphics.  Great story.  Just about endless gameplay (even after you beat the main game and end game).  Very easy to beat if you understand some simple strategies that this game requires.  And it puts a major emphasis on force multiplication rather than simply mindlessly wiping out the opposition.  AI is pretty impressive towards the end of the game.

Cons:
Has one sick part in the end that Kojima would probably describe as a ""necessary evil"".
Also, some button action options and MB coins.

This game is pretty much the culmination of what made all the other MGS games great.  If you like any of the previous MGS games, there's something in here for you.

What I didn't like about the game was the way that there doesn't seem to be a predictive button action feature.  Something that would learn your patterns when there are multiple interactions available in the same geographic location such as having the choice to Fulton extract an enemy, or pick up his weapon because both are in the same spot.  This makes it so that you have to restrain from pushing and holding the button until the screen displays the option you're sure you want to enact.

Something else (which is inherently greedy) is the MB coin aspect. Why pay actual money to speed up the FOB component of the game?  And once you enable the FOBs, GMP is divided and shared, and in a way that pushes you to want to advance the online parts more than the actual side ops.  The result is that you either have to wait patiently for more daily free MB coins, or you have to fork out some cold hard real world cash to Konami.

Still, this game is very easy, very fun, and very well done.  I'm now looking forward to what Kojima does next (Death Stranding), however, I don't know that I'll want to play MGS Survive since it has a high likelihood of showing even more of Konami's greed for users to purchase MB coins and other nonsense.

If MGS Sruvive ends up being a well-made game, then I'll be all for it.

Also, I didn't use it for the main game (I use it sometimes to get quick inventory when I need supplies), but there is a ""chicken hat"" feature for those of you who think this game is too difficult.  It's basically a funny way to rush through stocking up if you don't feel like wasting too much time sneaking around.  I definitely DON'T recommend using that hat for the main two game parts (unless you're completely new to this franchise and want to learn the ropes).

But once you figure out the psychological aspect to the way these games work, it'll become a lot easier for your muscle memory to kick in and speed through the game in a very enjoyable way.  You can even get the opposition so scared that they'll run from you.

It's definitely not a shooter anywhere near as much as it is about puting some thought into your actions.  If you prefer to just point and shoot, then buy something else.  If you like having to outsmart the opposition while also thinking several moves ahead of the game by carrying out things like sabotage detonations when you're exfiltrating an area, and also stealing enemy supplies, then this game is definitely for you!  It remembers enemy utilities that you've previously destroyed.  Sometimes those utilities are replaced, but going in ahead of time to sabotage an enemy base can make earning an ""S"" rank on primary missions a lot easier.  It's one of my all time favorite games.

Also, if the game says to destroy enemy vehicles, just Fulton extract them instead.  It'll help you in the long run.

This game definitely isn't for most people, but ever since the first MGS, I've been hooked.  Kojima made sure that each iteration of MGS was more intuitive, had better graphics, and utilized system resources more effectively.  Here's to hoping the team at Konami keeps with this tradition when making future MGS games.",5.0

"Marvel has had a lot of success in the video game industry, and a lot of failures too. I'm a big Marvel fan, and what I can say about this game is that it's the best damn Marvel game you're gonna play. Of course, I don't expect you to be a fan of ALL of the characters in this game. I haven't even heard of a lot of the characters in this game, especially the cheesy enemies. But you can really learn a lot about the Marvel Universe just by listening to the dialogue and learning from your mistakes in the trivia. I've learned a lot about all of the different characters after beating the game. Now I can understand the segment in Robot Chicken about the Watcher. It is VERY fun to play with more than one person, because you can team up with the computer or just stick to two/three people, or even play with FOUR people. Marvel fan or not, this game is way too awesome not to own. I can't wait for the second one, and if you're reading this when Ultimate Alliance 2 already came out, then I definitely have it!",5.0
"The characters, plot, mechanics, everything is perfect about this game.

"I have played this game since it came out when I was 4, and it has never gotten stale. The graphics are wonderful for this era of game, and actually are comparable to some of current times.
Whether you are a die-hard Spyro fan and just missed out on this game, or you just heard of the series and are looking for an ideal game for yourself or as a gift to another video gamer, I highly recommend this game. As a child I enjoyed the colors, sounds, and smooth gameplay; as a young adult, it is fun to challenge myself to completing the game. The replay value is pretty high, in my humble opinion; I've completed this game numerous times and still play again, and again. This is one of the three Spyro games I've found to be truly enjoyable (the first, Spyro the Dragon, and the third, Spyro: Year of the Dragon, are the other two - all of which make up the Spyro trilogy for the PS1), as the later games just don't meet the bar of excellence these three games meet.
Whether a seasoned video game player or someone looking for a great gift, Ripto's Rage will deliver.

"Yes the game feels like roaming in paradise. It is a great beauty. Controls are perfect. Every aspect of the game is implemented with so much care, bar for racing/action games is raised to a new high.

"Great Upgrade from Madden 25, Feels more like I'm playing in a real game, Madden 15 Challenges you more than 25.
I think the graphics are a little better and I love knowing the knowledge of the game, and it teaches everyone with the skills challenges.
Offense is great in this game, You just can't score 60 points a game like you could on 25 and when you score if feels more rewarding. You have to put more touch on the ball when passing, You cant just throw bullets or they will be intercepted.
Defense is the biggest upgrade from 25 to 15, Playing defense is fun and the hits and the pass rush are better than 25. Playing defense in 25 just seemed worthless.",5.0

Tales of Phantasia is a tale of the past, present and the future.

For the first time in the USA, Tales of Phantasia is gracing our shores with a quest of revenge and time travel. This is the first installment of the ""Tales of ..."" series from Namco.

You start out as Cress, a young boy, and his friend go on a hunting trip, only to find that when they get back that their town is in ruins and everyone is dead.

This game has been the most fun I have ever had with GBA system. Tales of Phantasia has enough action and adventure to keep you glued to your GBA for 70+ hours.

The battle system takes some getting used to. You must assign your special attacks to certain button combinations, for instance: up, down, left or right plus B or B by itself will perform the special attack that you have assigned.

You can assign the same move to all the button combos if you want to. For standard attacks you will press up, down, left or right plus the A button or the A button by itself.

You can stop the action in the middle of an attack to give your team orders. Like you notice that you are almost dead, so you stop the action to tell your healer to cast a spell that heals your wounds.

Scores:
Graphics - They are great for the GBA, 8/10.

Sound and Music - The voice acting in the beginning of the game hooked me in for the long haul 70+ hours of musical bliss, 8/10.

Gameplay ? Battle system is perfect. Puzzles were tough enough for you to rejoice after you figured them out, 10/10.

Overall ? The most enjoyable game to grace my GBA, 10/10. Perfect score! Run don?t walk to get this game.",5.0
"I check this site almost hourly waiting for a pre-order, and still no luck.  Wish we could design our own packages.  I already have the Star Wars item on order, and would prefer more controllers.  It will definitely be worth the wait.  I purchased both the SNES and N64, on their release dates for 199.99, only to have the price drop several months later.",5.0
"This expansion / DLC is a must-have for Civ 5.  It makes the game a lot better and should have really been included with the game when it came out, but I would say that about any excellent expansion.  Don't get it for a new game experience, but do start out with it on the first day you play Civ 5.  It adds a lot of details to the game.",5.0

"It's a wonderful thing when you favorite game is for an obsolite console and it gets remaid for your gamecube better than ever! This wonderful game is a must by for anyone. The story mode is expansive and identical to SonicAdventure, exept for slightly altered voice acting to impove quality. Did I mention they also fixed the graphics problems? They did, and now it looks beautiful! I can't explain it, you have to see the difference for your self! Plus there's the all new mission mode in which you run around the adventure field completing tasks, after you've finished that characters story of course. Plus, every 20 emblems you collect, you unlock one of the original sonic games to be played from the Mini-Games menu, which apears when you unlock the first game(Sonic the HedgeHog).
Even if you have to sell you bed to aford it, if you a sonic fan this one is a need not a want.",5.0
"I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons (paper and dice game) since the late 1980's, and I can tell you that this computer game is the closest thing to the old-school version.  The world is overwhelming, the cities are full of people, The storyline is excellent, the graphics and magical effects are breathtaking, and the 3-D world can bee navigated easily with a camera mode that the player can control, including rotating 360 degrees and zoom in/out.  The game is similar to the Baldur's Gate series (also Forgotten Realms), so if you've played those before you will easily learn Neverwinter.
The game can seem extremely complex at first, with all the character sheets and inventory menu screens, but with time anyone interested in these kinds of games should have no problem mastering the basic controls and concepts.
I was going to give Neverwinter Nights one star because of its horrid performance on my P4 1.5Ghz 256mb RAM computer, but then I realized my computer crashed a year ago and I had forgotten to load my vdeo card driver software.  Even still, this game requires a hefty amount of hardware to run.",5.0

"O.K. I am too dumb to play without a copy of the walkthrough...so I saved a bit of time there. I had been impressed by a ""night scene"" in Egypt 2, but when I made it to the ""Night Scene"" in the Kingdom of ISIS...I was actually blown away by the breathtaking BEAUTY ....I actually closed the game just so I could revisit that Beautiful Island for about 3 days and whenever I has a minute I just ""sat"" there and looked up at the sky!
The graphics are MUCH better than Egypt 2, and the characters much less cartoonish. The story line is O.K.the puzzles not too hard....I sometimes asked myself ""Is this the kind of thing that other adults are REALLY spending time on??""....but then I find I just HAVE to do a detour to sit by the pool at the Temple, or admire the Land of Isis, and I think ""WOW!""...how do they PUT all this Dream stuff onto a little bitty disc?",5.0

THIS IS SUCH A CLASSIC GAME! I bought this because I used to play it all the time when I was a kid and I wanted to bring back some old memories.

"I had the chance to play this game when it was first released, and jumped on the opportunity to own the game at a super discounted price. While this version forced me to register via Origin (yuck!) I had loved playing this game, as the combat was just beautiful and remarkably engaging.

Basically this game is a one direction 3d platformer, where you take on the role of Alice as she has grown older, exploring both the real world and Wonderland in its unusually dark and bloody state. In this pack, you are able to don different costumes throughout the game, as well as override the choices with your own bonus costumes (with different perks as well)
The environment is one of the most beautiful and creative settings I have ever played in a game, and it's a pity that the game is so dark because I would have loved to spend more time exploring through such a world if it had been more of an RPG rather than a one-track platformer.

This game is extremely tough to get running flawlessly, especially with the oil slicks, so I play with PhysEng set to low, while everything else is still maxed out.",5.0

"This is an awesome thing to purchase if you have a Wii, no matter if your an adult or a teen.
1. I'm a teen, I wasn't sure if this would be for me.  But it sure is, you can play it for hours because its so fun and let me tell you that the balance games are addicting!
2. You lose weight.  Me and my friend played it for about 2 days?  I think I lost about 5 pounds?  I was super happy!  I mean I surely gained it back soon but I mean this thing works if you use it for a set amount of time each day, which I don't
3. As you go on playing and exercising you can unlock new games and exercises.  Here are some of the things you can do in aerobics (I think) and balance games:
  - you try to block the soccer balls
  - you try to balance yourself and go across the tightrope
  - you try to get the ball into the hole, without the ball going over the edge (it sounds confusing, but its not) and they keep adding more balls
  - you can ski jump
  - you can do the ski slalom
  - you can take a run (two player or one)
  - you do this little step on the board step off, kinda like guitar hero but for your feet and without music
  - you can hula hoop!

"Very good game. Best one out of the whole Pet Vet series. You start out with 500 bucks. You have to earn a thousand to advertise your place and such, and you have to complete all of the tasks that it gives you. For example, when you first start off, somewhere along the line it tells you that you have to heal a rabbit. Then it will tell you to heal a guinea pig or something. It's really fun, and you even get to own your very own horse when you get some more dough. A horse costs 5,000 bucks, so save up! You can also get a loan of 5,000 dollars. It's really great for starters because it only costs you 300 bucks a day and it keeps adding up until that 300 turns into 5,000. Its not like theres a dead line when you have to pay back your 5,000. You just keep adding up the money every day. It's like a bank account. But anyways, it is really cool because you get to care for 5 different types of animals (it may be six but I'm pretty sure it's five) . If it is very ill, you get to restore the animal back to health in one of the animal houses until the owner comes back. There are no faults for this game. I love it! And you will too. :) All you have to do is buy it. Go ahead, you'll love it!",5.0
"Great with many ways of beating the game. At first I did not like this game very much. It is somewhat boring in the beginning. Then I started building up my character and figuring out the mechanics of the game. You get a crap load of possible skills.

You can beat the game in the following ways:
1. combat
2. stealth (you can one or more to get around: invisibility cloak, high jump, blast walls, silent running, silencer on weapons, improved radar)
3. combat & stealth
4. persuasion in conversation
5. non-lethal only (you unlock something for doing this)
6. Hack bots/turrets
7. Use several different guns which you can upgrade. Guns include pistol, silenced pistol, shotgun, machine gun, rifle, rocket launcher, sniper rifle, tranquilizer, dart gun, nonlethal sniper rifle, typhoon.

"Note: I going to concentrate this review on the ""extras"" found in the Collector's Edition. My reason being that if you are thinking of purchasing the Collector's Edition, you probably are aware of what the game is like.

What exactly is Dark Souls? It's a spiritual succesor to Demon's Souls, and in reality it might as well be called Demon's Souls II. The game is very atmospheric, very beautiful, eiry, and of course very challenging. As in Demon's Souls, dying is something that is a natural part of Dark Souls. The game is meant to be challenging, and if you played Demon's Souls you know exactly what to expect. If you did not enjoy Demon's Souls, there is no point in purchasing this game. If you did not play Demon's Souls, you might want to purchase that (it's only $20) before purchasing the more expensive Dark Souls. Now, for those of you who are definitely going to purchase Dark Souls, is the Collector's Edition worth the extra cost? The answer, it depends...

First, if you pre-ordered this game, you got the Collector's Edition at NO extra cost! So in that sense, yes this is clearly a wonderful bonus! If you missed out on the pre-order (the Collector's Edition is now sold out), should you pay extra for a copy? Well, here is what is found in the Collector's Edition:

1)First thing you'll notice, it comes in a beautiful and large steelcase (or steel case, steelbook, whatever you call it). Note that it's not real steel of course, but most likely tin. Nevertheless, the case is very well done, and holds the game and arbook.

2)Limited Edition Artbook: it's nice. I'm not a huge fan of game-related artbooks, but this is a nice hard cover artbook. It's not the size of a ""normal"" book (I consider normal the size of a sheet of paper or 8.5"" x 11""), but substantially smaller. Still, it fits snuggly in the steelcase.

3)Mini-Strategy Guide: this is available as a DOWNLOAD only!! Boo... I hate download only items. I would much rather have had the strategy guide be available in hardcopy and have the artbook as a download. I don't know who decided this should be a download only, but I would not give that person/people a high I.Q. rating...

4)Original Game Soundtrack: this is available as a DOWNLOAD only!! What? the beautiful soundtrack...download only?! Yes, that's right. Another ""brilliant"" move by marketers who are oblivious to what their customers want.

5)Behind the Scenes Video: this is available as a DOWNLOAD only!! Yes, yet again, you are left stranded with a donwload only.

6)A Card to Redeem items 3,4,5.

So there you have it. The items that in my opinion truly make a collector's editions special (special strategy guide and game soundtrack) are download only! I consider this very lame. Yet, I gave the game 5 stars... why? Well, because I can't deny the fact that all these bonuses were given for free! This collector's edition did not cost (originally) any more than the regular edition. The regular edition is a 5-star game in my opinion, and the collector's edition is the same thing with FREE bonuses. So, it's up to you to decide whether these extras are worth the ""extra"" cost (since you likely will not find the collector's edition for the original price any more). Also, keep in mind that prices will vary. You might be able to find the collector's edition at only a ""little"" more than the original cost, and other sellers will ask 2-3 times the original cost. As I said, it's up to you, but hopefully this review has helped you decide one way or the other. Either way, let me say that the game itself is still fantastic...",5.0

"With each new entry into the Castlevania Series on GBA it only gets better.  This is by far the best entry of the Castelvania Series for GBA.  THe story revolves around SOma Cruz who is a high School student who during an Eclipse get trapped in Draculas Castle.  Inside he meets Arikado (ALucard) J. (a Belmont) Grahm (Born at the Moment Dracula was last Slain) as well as others who have had ties to Castlevania in the past.  Soma somehow is given the ability to absorb the souls of monsters.  He must use this ability (along with a vast array of Weapons) to explore and eventually escape Draculas Castle.
The reason this is the best of the GBA titles is that it combines the best of both games.  It holds the mass expanisve castel qualities that both games held, more Difficult that HoD but easier than CotM.  THe fights are varied (although some still return Death, LEgion).  The real uniqueness to this is the soul absorbing system.  By doing this Soma gets over 100 new abilities that he can customize for the situation.  One moment he may need extra Defense, the Lightening attack, and the ability to walk on water, the next he needs the Fire Storm, Extra Offense, and an Imp as backup.  The possibilites are endless.
Overall this is the best entry thus far.  It is not as hard as CotM was (which was very BArabaric) but it is not as easy as HoD (which was laughably easy).  This is definatly a must have if you have a GBA.",5.0

"Atlus rarely disappoints their fans. Whether with the ""hardcore"" MegTen/SMT gams or the supposed ""only slightly less hardcore"" Persona series, Atlus knows how to craft relatable characters, intriguing settings, and interesting plots rolled into amazing, and very addicting, RPGs.

Over the years of course things have ""streamlined"" and while arguably maybe not so much as Bethesda, or just like Bethesda depending on where you stand, you can see the differences that began to change with SMT 3: Nocturne and the other ps2 SMT games(and while technically the off shoot Persona games may not be part of the SMT ""line"" of games, there are obvious connections that have that series branch off from SMT, much like the not-so-distant relative to the MegTen franchise that started in the 80s before SMT was even in the picture).

Soul hackers is a great middle ground for those who wish to see that progression without having to be brutally destroyed by trying earlier S/MT...which I highly recommend at least trying after getting through Soul Hackers.

The difficulty of DS:SH can be ""hacked"" in either direction( high difficulty, low difficulty, or ""off"" for a normal setting) which is mighty helpful for everyone without punishing anyone.

As far as gameplay goes it is as engrossing as any SMT game. You follow along a cyberpunk, technologically advanced society with connections to the occult...demons. There have been many comparisons to Pokemon, but the similarities pretty much end at ""collecting demons/monsters"" and grinding to level up. However in both this and earlier SMT games, the demons do not level up, at least in the traditional sense

There is very rewarding loyalty system which usually ends(from 1-5) with your demons both respecting the orders you give and giving a nice(most of the time) bonus to damage given. Usually this is seen with a ""loyalty"" skill. There are different demon ""identities"" that affect how they react to you and how their loyalty raises. Without spoiling too much, a great example is the ""wild"" demons tend to prefer physical attacks, while ""dumb"" demands would rather you let them choose their attacks(watch out for demons with suicide/last resort skills...they are ""dumb"" demons afterall). As you play the game you'll find other types of demons and learn their idiosyncrasies. The game will also give hints along the way.

In addition to this you have the common demon fusion system where you'll most likely be fusing and discarding demons at a higher rate in the game instead of grinding certain demons(beyond raising their loyalty).

Another feature is the Zoma demon, which basically you craft yourself, and is somewhat similiar to the later games way of choose which skills a demon gets, and while you don't exactly pick and choose the skills a Zoma gets when you fuse it with another demon, it will absorb the skills of that demon. As you play you'll find other interesting ways the Zoma can be useful and there are many guides online dedicated just to the Zoma itself!

Whether you are a newcomer to the entire series or have only played the ps2 era and beyond, there are some others things to keep in mind, this maybe considered a spoil to some....but the MC does not use magic and previous games followed this same formula. You can still put points into the magic skill(along with Str, agi, Intel, etc) but I wouldn't go beyond 10 or so and would especially focus on Strength and Endurance, and perhaps a few points into intelligence as it affects magic defense. The Female partner is the primary magic user(besides the demons of course) and was common before SMT III.

In addition to the difficulty hack, there are other options to help new comers breeze through the game a bit more easily, such as the automap, however it may be more rewarding to do it yourself like in other dungeon crawling games...but totally up to you.

I could go on. The story, by game standards at least, is very interesting and helps keep you playing in addition to the rewarding battle, fusion, skill system.

I highly recommend this to any SMT fan! If you haven't played this or earlier S/MT games, but are waiting impatiently for SMT IV: Final or Persona 5 this could be a nice distraction.

And to someone entirely new to SMT, but a big rpg buff I suggest taking a crack at it and join the MegaTen club.

"I went through a couple of high bass headphones before I found these.  I was looking for something to use with ""Battlefield 4"" when I was broadcasting to my Twitch. TV Channel.  These were the first pair I could clearly hear shell casings from the ""AWS"" LMG hitting the ground just as cleanly as the rounds leaving the barrel.  Most of the headsets had great bass, but weak or muffled treble.  These were the first pair that let me hear every without loosing any detail or treble.  I can hear the every shell casing hit the ground even as I lay down suppresing fire on the RPGs flying past my head in the tower on ""Op Locker"" in BF4!!!  ^o^

 I now use them exclusively when I'm broadcasting.  I can keep them on for a 4 hour broadcast and they're still comfortable!!!  @_@

What's more now that the ""Simple Background Music"" App is out for my XBOX ONE I've had a chance to hear my Twitch. TV playlist through my BF4 matches.

"Zelda Ocarina of Time for N64 was by far the best game I've ever played. The Zelda games have been lacking ever since then. I bought the 3DS XL primarily to get back into Zelda - this was the first game I have played on the system.

All I can say is wow! That Zelda feeling of great design, great game dynamics, and quality are here. I've been having a blast revisiting old memories, exploring - and the dungeons are fun. This has that Zelda classic figure it out/puzzle aspect that is definitely just the right amount of complexity. Some are challenging but it's well fit as to easy would be so boring.

One thing they could improve upon is detail in the maps - I feel like they could have added more scenery in dungeons and complexity in the world in terms of look. However, still 5 starts as we don't get to many games for adults in the 3DS library.

Keep them coming!",5.0
"I want to give a nod to NFS:HP for the weather effects in the game.  Racing in a night-time thunderstorm is just too cool.  And there's even snow and fog as you climb up into the mountains.  Very, VERY pretty scenery throughout the game.  The wet pavement is gorgeous.  And if you want a no-stress drive through beautiful scenery, just go into free-drive.  Nothing to worry about except traffic.  Seacrest County will become a place you'd like to visit for real.  A nice rural, coastal, mountain area, with nary a house in sight.  Just the occasional motel or gas station, or lighthouse, or airstrip.  Look for the waterfalls!  Pretty, pretty, pretty.

The frame rate is very high.  Seems like 60fps.  No motion-blur here.

One other thing: though there are plenty of shortcuts in this game, there appear to be no jumps.  The game is about going fast, not getting airborne.",5.0
"New technology, desire for on-line play and changes in interface preferences (less overhead point and click of several characters) have led to substantial changes in the later games produced by bioware.  Nothing against the later games, some of which are excellent, but BG 2 still stands out as one of the great games of all time.  The graphics are excellent and the story moves well.  Further, there is a strong range of NPCs to choose from and lots of excellent subplots for each that the player can follow.
The depth of the story is perhaps its strongest feature.  This is high fantasy at its finest.  Continuing from BG I, the story follows the player as a Bhaalspawn, with great potential for good and evil.  Players can choose which trach to take and which alignment they want to associate with.  Want to be a Paladin paling around with a good cleric/wizard?  Can do.  What to be an evil theif with an evil mage companion? You can do that to.
The depth of the maps of the game are excellent, though in a few places you can get stuck because it is unclear what path is available.  The game also includes several great improvements, like the character getting the chance to own a keep with its own special quests, based on which class you have.
The Throne of Bhaal addition brings the game to a great creshendow.  I don't want to give up too much, but other planes and the possibility of godhood are in your future if you play through to the end.

"First off, the graphics are phenomenal.  No jaggies, no slow down, good framerate, beautiful weather effects, and camera views that are just like real broadcasts.  Most F1 games are only for diehard F1 fans but this one adds all sorts of Driving Aids to help newcomers adjust to the gameplay.  Since these can be turned on and off however you like, the difficulty suits you however you're comfortable playing.  Another huge feature is the Virtual Racing line, which is helps to let you know when you should brake, slow down, and accelerate using different colors and also shows the best position for making turns.  This can be turned off as well.  The online is addicting and features 22 cars with half being computer AI to add more realistic racing.  You cannot crash into the AI cars so you are basically in direct competition with live people.  The career mode and the World Championship mode are pretty much exactly what a real F1 driver goes through in a season.  You can adjust every aspect of the car including fuel, gear ratios, tires, parade laps to warm up your tires, adjust oversteering, etc.  The career mode is more the F1 enthusiasts but newcomers will enjoy the WC and Quick Race mode.  It has all 18 official F1 courses, and drivers.  The only problem is that the roster is out of date for the upcoming 2007 season.  The game is a showcase for the PS3 and is a must buy for any true racing fan, or any PS3 owner looking for something new.",5.0
"The Genesis-exclusive sequel to the arcade classic, Golden Axe II plays almost exactly like its predecessor, but with new layouts and enemies to deal with. I'm not complaining, though; the beat 'em up gameplay of the original is back in full force here anyway! It's still a lot of fun to beat down the slew of incoming baddies with either my weapon or an animal I can ride. It's especially satisfying to have them tossed into bottomless pits or killing giant boss enemies!

Returning from the Genesis version of Golden Axe is The Duel, which turns this game into a fighter where you fight one enemy, and move on to the next one (or ones?) after claiming your victory over that enemy. It's an interesting, fun take on the beat 'em up formula that serves to add to the overall package. And I believe it does that fine.

If you've played through the first Golden Axe, you won't have any trouble playing through this one as well, but you'll at least still have fun doing so.",5.0

"When you look at Call of Duty now a days, you think of a multi million selling franchise that is stale and is hated. However, let's rewind time back to 2007, when Call of Duty 4 was released, and think back to those glorious days in 2007. Call of Duty 4 was and is a fantastic game, with an expertly designed campaign with an intense story and engaging set pieces, while still feeling fairly realistic, and some of the best multiplayer ever in a first person shooter, and Call of Duty 4 was acclaimed as one of the best shooters of all time. I still stand by this opinion today. Call of Duty, after this game was released, either tried too hard or they simply didn't change their formula. However, that doesn't detract from this fantastic game.

Without going too much into detail on the story, the story revolves around the United States Army and the British SAS as you travel around the world playing as two different soldiers trying to hunt down a terrorist who has caused world wide terror. Unlike Call of Duty games before it, the narrative was one campaign, where the paths of the soldiers crossed, and not everyone made it out alive. The story was not only improved because it was connected, but the modern setting made the story not only refreshing, but it was also presented in a gritty and realistic matter. Modern Warfare really nails the gritty feeling of war and the battlefield, and the set pieces are appropriately thrilling, without detracting from the realism of the campaign. The characters were also memorable and likable, and you really cared about what happened to them at the end of the campaign. With all of these components combined, the story in Modern Warfare is fantastic, and the campaign is the best in the series because of it.

Graphically, while Call of Duty 4 doesn't look quite as great as most games on the market, back in the day the technology was revolutionary, and the game still holds up well today in terms of graphics. The textures were great back then, while looking somewhat underwhelming today, but the game still has some awesome effects, the levels in the singleplayer really look realistic and some of the set pieces are gorgeous. Online, the game runs incredibly well at 60 frames per second. The game runs well and there is never a moment where the visuals aren't on par with the rest of the game.

The sound design is also impressive. The voice acting both in singleplayer and multiplayer is excellent, with a sense of realism and likability to the characters to keep you engaged. The sound design of the guns is also fantastic, and you really feel like you are doing some damage with the assortment of assault riffles, sub machine guns, shotguns, snipers, and pistols given to you during the game. The sound of all of the gun shots, explosions, and terrorist shouts give the game a sense of realism, intensity, and urgency that is rarely seen in other shooters. In addition, the original score is fantastic, being memorable and explosive when it needs to be, but also dark and eerie to match the mood set by the game. The sound design is overall fantastic and adds a lot to the game.

Call of Duty 4's gameplay is the best in the series, and is nearly flawless. To start, the mechanics remain similar to the Call of Duty games before: Aiming down your sights with your weapon and auto aiming enemies in the campaign with a fairly linear design and smooth controls. However, Call of Duty 4 was even faster in terms of how the game ran, and this made the battles more intense and made the mechanics even smoother. The controls also feel the most responsive out of any Call of Duty game, making running, going prone, aiming, and throwing back enemy grenades feel smooth and effortless. The campaign action is also much better than in the other games before. The enemy AI and friendly AI are both much better than in the previous games. Your friendly AI actually fights realistically and will save your lives, while the enemies take more flanking positions and perform more tactics to take you down. The AI isn't exactly perfect, as sometimes there are a few dumb terrorists who run at you, but overall they are pretty smart and provide a good challenge. The levels are also expertly designed, giving the player plenty of option in how they want to take down their enemy. In addition, the grit in the story creates some awesome set pieces and intense moments in the campaign, such as a hardcore sniping mission where you need to actually use the wind to judge how you want to shoot your bullet, some helicopter turret scenes, and an eerie mission where you take down enemies from above using an AC-130 gunship. All of these components add to a campaign that is short, but ultimately unforgettable and one of the best in its genre. On top of this, there are multiple difficulty settings which make the game much more challenging from level to level. There are also a couple of dozen of pieces of enemy intel to collect, which give you unlockables such as unlimited ammo in the singleplayer. There is also an option called arcade mode, where you play through the levels of the campaign, racing against the clock to complete objectives as well as getting extra points for double kills, grenade kills, ect. It is quite a nice addition to the game.

The singleplayer in Call of Duty 4 is intense, fun, and unforgettable, but the real star of the game is the incredible online multiplayer. Call of Duty 4's multiplayer is fantastic and revolutionized many shooters today. Call of Duty's smooth mechanics from the campaign transition perfectly over to multiplayer, however the real star of Call of Duty 4 is the ability to customize your load out. In later Call of Duty games, this feature is expanded, with gun ranking, more perks, death streaks, and other components that made the series unbalanced and far too over the top. However, in Call of Duty 4, customization comes in the form of perks, which give your character special abilities such as extra damage, more ammo, and the ability to drop a grenade upon death, gun attachments and camo, and unlocking new weapons. As you play through Call of Duty 4, you rank up and unlock more weapons, attachments, camo, and perks to customize your load out. Perks are special abilities that enhance your character or class, and you can customize them accordingly. You can assign three perks to each class, with three different categories. The first one is for ammo, attachments, or special weapons, the second one is more for your actual combat such as extra dammage or faster reload, and perk three is generally between the first one and the third one, they enhance you in actual combat, but they don't necessarily make you more powerful. These can be steady aim, or dropping a live grenade when you die. The perks work so well because not only do they add a dimension of strategy in your loadouts, and assigning proper perks to proper weapons, but the system is also incredibly balanced, and for every perk there is there is always one to counter it. This makes the game feel very balanced, regardless of your level. The weapons also feel balanced, no one weapon is too powerful or too weak, and depending on the type of player you are, you can use whatever you want and still do good in a match. The balanced gameplay and constant ranking make the multiplayer design not only revolutionary and balanced, but also keeps you addicted and is loads of fun. The game modes are pretty typical for a first person shooter, with your deathmatch, domination, and search and destroy modes you expect from the series, but the addition or hardcore, which causes bullet damage to be much higher and the HUD to go away, and old school, where every weapon and perk is a pick up, add a new dimension to the game modes, and makes them unique and exciting.

Overall, Call of Duty 4 is one of the best shooters on the market. It isn't perfect mind you, the visuals are slightly dated, the campaign is short, and the multiplayer does have some lag. However, these are very small problems compared to how much Call of Duty 4 does right. It's campaign is gritty, exciting, and powerful, while the multiplayer is addicting, balanced, and fun. Add on some seriously awesome sound design and an excellent frame rate, and you have yourself one complete and excellent package. If you are a shooter fan, don't hesitate to buy Call of Duty 4. It is much better than any of the Call of Duty games to come out recently. If you already own Call of Duty 4, do yourself a favor and forget about the new games in the series, and take a trip down memory lane and experience this masterpiece once again.

Final Tally:

Presentation: 9.5/10: The story is gritty, realistic, and awesome. The mood of the game is also awesome, and the multiplayer is fantastic. The short campaign is hardly a complaint.

Graphics: 9/10: While somewhat dated today in terms of the textures, the lighting, character models, animations, and framerate are all excellent.

Sound: 10/10: The sound design makes each battle feel intense and engaging, the voice acting is fantastic and makes you connect to the soldiers, and the original score adds a lot to the overall experience.

Gameplay: 9.5/10: The AI is only slightly off in the campaign, though they are mostly consistant. The set pieces are breathtaking and the campaign is expertly designed. The multiplayer is outstanding and by far one of the best on the market, despite a small amount of lag.

Replay Value: 9.5/10: While the campaign is short, it is engaging and there are things to keep you coming back to it. The multiplayer is excellent, however, and will keep you playing long after you beat the campaign.

Final Score: 9.5/10",5.0

A few of the other Smash characters have amiibo AI issues where they might not use their up special properly and fall to their death too much. DeDeDe doesn't seem to have that problem and after just a few training matches, he was kicking my butt! He will probably beat your friends too, so train it well!",5.0

"Growing up in the 80's I was a kid hooked on the NES and Super Mario Bros. Game. I still have it and play it farely often. The Mario series was solid until Sunshine (in my opinion). I didn't like Mario Sunshine much. Then Super Mario series added Galaxy and a Super Mario Bros. Wii....Those were pretty good games. Much better than Sunshine. Well, I just picked up this Super Mario Bros. Wii U game on Friday, & like it a lot! It has some old school (Super Mario World) feel to it. Some of the levels look and remind me of some older levels. It has some more recent Mario features to it that are cool too! The gameplay is simple enough. The colors and graphics are vibrant and sharp (as they always have for their times). I'd highly recommend this game to anyone that likes playing Mario games. Even those that grew up on NES & SNES Mario, may like this one a lot! You can play up to 5 players on it. I've only been running through it solo. My girlfriend started her own profile and playthough of the game too! Our son really likes it a lot too!",5.0
If you were on the fence or off put because of the bad reviews complaining about multiplayer issues they have FINALLY been fixed.

This is the best 3rd party game I have played for WII.  The graphics and storyline are done superb.  No more heroes is one of the only adult theme games that is on the WII.

If you like games with great plot and action than Heroes is a must.  Get this game you will not regret it!!!!!,5.0

D-pad and buttons seem responsive.  I have even been able to do fatalities on Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.  I would definitely recommend this for retro gaming.

NOTE: The controllers I received say iBuffalo at the top instead of Buffalo.  I have no idea if this is a knockoff brand or not as the packaging and instructions are pretty much all in Japanese.",5.0

"Assassin's Creed II is one of those games that does everything a sequel should.  It improves the on the areas where improvement was needed without straying so far from the original as to be an entirely different game, while still managing to distinguish itself from it's predecessor.  Missions and environments are more varied, combat and movement is less frustrating, and the in game environment is even better looking and more diverse than the previous version.

<<<SPOILER ALERT>>>

New Assassin and New Setting:

The game kicks off with Desmond again, and this time it's revealed that Lucy, Desmond's handler, is working for the Assassins and they escape from Abstergo.  Once they've escaped Desmond meets Lucy's team of modern day Assassins and they hook up Desmond to another Animus to once again search through Desmond's genetic memory to find what Abstergo, now revealed to be the modern day Templars, was looking for as part of the ongoing conflict between the Assassins and Templars.  This time the ancestor you will play as is Ezio an Italian assassin living during the renaissance period.  Ezio becomes an assassin as a result of a large portion of his family being executed by the ruling class in Italy, who are aligned with the Templars.  You then carry out missions and assassinations working towards the ultimate goal of revenge.  Along the way you will encounter actual historical figures like Leonardo Da Vinci , that lend a certain sense of authenticity to the game.

Diminished Frustration Factor:

The gameplay is what has seen the most improvement in this game.  Let's start with the weapons.  Weapons and abilities are improved and upgraded as you progress through the game, much like the first game.  The flashiest addition is that now Ezio is eventually able to wield two hidden blades.  This creates many new options, for example Ezio can discreetly dispatch two guards protecting an entrance.  Another useful weapon is the gun.  Fortunately, the gun is not terribly effective against enemies who are fighting you, but it is a perfect tool for assassination and adds more tactical options to the gameplay.  Money is also now a weapon.  Anyone who played the first game remembers how annoying the beggars were.  Now you can get past them by throwing a handful of change, which can also a useful distraction for guards.  Navigation in general is improved, free running over the rooftops of Roma or Venetia is great and there  is a great deal more variety in the NPC's and the environment which keeps things from becoming a bore.  Additionally, fighting when you've broken stealth is a lot more fun and less tedious thanks to some new combos that make combat less of a slog.

Auditory Enhancement:

Voice acting and music in this game also felt like a serious improvement over the first.  The musical cues when you are being chased still resonate in my mind and definitely added to the thrill of the chase.  NPC's speech is also much more varied than the first game and while there is still definitely repetition, it is not as pronounced as the first game.  The ambient music also does a wonderful job of matching the area you're strolling through.  The voice acting for the main characters is great and the Italian accents seemed pretty realistic (at least to me) and really helped boost the immersion factor.

Italian Vista:

The graphics are beautiful, even better than the first game I felt.  Renaissance Italy really came to life, and again immerses you into this fascinating world of conspiracy and corruption.  Part of what makes the game so visually appealing is a liberal use of color.  The first game was far too beige to remain visually stimulating for long.  Whether it be the vibrant blue waters of Venetia or the brightly colored and detailed decorations of Florentine the game environment is just right, not so beige and detail sparse that you fall asleep, while at the same time not being so overstimulating that it breaks the immersion factor.

A Collector's Paradiso:

There is a great variety of things to in this game once the main missions are done.  Returning from the first game are the collectible flags found all over the cities and countryside.  Additionally, you will be able to collect hidden ""seals"" on various historical building that eventually unlock an interesting video.  There are other collectibles as well, in addition to side assassination missions and the ability to add architectural improvements to your villa.  Bottom line here is that if you like to be distracted from the main missions occasionally, there should be enough here to satisfy you.

Bottom Line:

Graphics: Bella!  A vast improvement over the first game.  Certain things get recycled, but the majority of the game remains visually stimulating and quite varied.

Audio: Fantastic voice acting and musical cues, the audio meshes quite seamlessly with the story and the action on screen.

Gameplay:  While there is some room for improvement, the most frustrating aspects of the first game have largely been rectified.  Combat can still get a little repetitive, but the improved controls and combos, plus Ezio's stylish flourishes make it a generally enjoyable experience even when you've lost the element of surprise.  The new weapons are an excellent addition to the gameplay.

Story:  Personally, I felt Ezio's story is far more engaging and memorable than Altair's.  More tidbits of the overarching conspiracy story are revealed here and some questions are answered to a certain extent, but things are still left open for a sequel.  More information about Desmond is revealed as well and the present day story arc is expanded.

Overall: Fantastic game that learns from its predecessor and irons out most of the wrinkles.  Likable characters and an intriguing story make this game thoroughly enjoyable and make the story move a great deal faster than the first title.  I would recommend this as a buy for anyone the least bit interested in the stealth/action genre.",5.0

"Do not be fooled by the cheap price this game is now, perhaps it is just because some people tend to shy away from flight games in general. I like that this game makes it simple to fly and get to the action quickly vs. being a true simluation with complicated controls. For graphics sake, make sure you follow instructions for running it in DirectX10 mode to see it at its best. I have had this game for awhile and it is still lots of fun and looks beautiful. The aircraft are beautifully rendered with sun dynamically shining off the wings. The game works great with my Logitech Freedom Wireless Joystick and it is even XBOX 360 controller compatible if you have that for your receiver for your pc. I haven't had a favorite flying game like this since old Crimson Skies. There's lots of action you get to quickly with an insane amount of missles. It is incredible that this came has 4 player campaign co-op through the standard campaign. Most flying games just restore to fighting friends in a simple dogfight mode, but campaign mode is much more fun, especially if they are not as familiar with the game and you'd just be repetitively shooting them out of the sky. You can have up to 3 of your friends as wingmen to accomplish all the objectives. I feel the environments when up close could look a bit sharper and have more destructibe environments, but unless you are hugging the ground (which gives a fun sense of speed) the maps will provide lots of nice scenery.",5.0

"I remember playing ""Mario Kart 64"" once with a neighbor's kids years ago.  Not a big fan of racing games then, I had a lot fun with this game (especially with the Battle Mode) and I've been itching for a chance to experience the fun again.  Now I can, any place, any time, thanks to ""Mario Kart DS.""

Still the undisputed king of handheld racing after its 2005 launch, ""MKDS"" seems to take the best of every game in the ""Mario Kart"" series and squeezes it all into that little game card, and sticking that nice label on it.  Starting in Grand Prix mode, you choose from 3 engine classes, 8 racers, 2 karts, and 4 cups with 4 courses each.  And then you're off!  There are more cups, karts and racers hidden in the game but with no cheat codes to speak of, you'll just have to do things the old fashioned way.  A map is provided on the touch screen in case you steer off course.

While a great gaming experience, you can only have so fun just racing while unlocking stuff.  Fortunately, there's so much more to do in ""MKDS.""  Aside from racing other players wirelessly or online, you can also enter an improved Battle mode with new arenas, including an old-school Nintendo DS.  And then there's yet another mode that has you take on different ""missions"" to unlock more missions.  To sum it all up, deciding whether or not this is a quality racing game for your DS, it's a no-brainer.

This game is rated E for Everyone: Mild Violence.",5.0
"Mass Effect is one of the most impacting and engrossing story of any video game I have played in my 33 years. This being the second entry to the series. The characters are endearing, the writing superb, the universe real, and this game has become an experience, not just a game. In any medium, I recommend any gamer, sci-fi fan, reader, or anyone appreciative of art pick up these games and play through them fully. Because that is what these games are, a true expression of art in an interactive visual experience.",5.0

"Im not going to lie Madden 2005 is a very good game, but espn 2k5 is easily better. Coming from somebody who has both games, let me tell you its better when it comes to gameplay, graphics, concept, sound, you name it. The players in Madden really look deformed, they all have tiny waste, huge shoulders and all look 5'9. And the gameplay is so unrealistic, its crazy. Football games aren't supposed to be realistic, but its supposed to at least be close. In Madden, you can pass like 1000 mph and run 300 mph, for example, and the tackles and the way the players run look so fake. Meanwhile, ESPN's graphics are modeled according to their real life statures because they put those dots on all of the players to get their exact shape and size. And the gameplay in ESPN is far better. You can actually play a close game and exciting game unlike Madden where you win the game 155-0 everytime. And another reason why ESPN 2K5 kills Madden this year is cause its just 20 bucks! Thats how much video games should cost, not a fourth of the ps2 itself (50 dollars). So Madden geeks, face it, if it wasn't for Madden's 10 year history and you were to just put the two games in front of a person who has never heard of Maddens rich history that person would say that ESPN 2K5 is far better!!!!",5.0

"There is so much to love about this game that I don't know where to start! You assume the role of John Marston, a retired outlaw whose family is abducted by the government and used as a bargaining tool; John can see his family once he kills the remaining members of his former gang. John's quest sends him across the American West (specifically a fictionalized Texas and Mexico) of 1911, where locomotives are nearing their Golden Age, automobiles are just seeing the light of day, horses are the main form of transportation, and lawlessness abounds. This is an open-world game where you can explore at will, hunt, take on storyline quests as well as numerous sidequests, play minigames (like poker, horseshoes, blackjack, or liar's dice), purchase weapons and clothing, and try to bring peace to your part of the world. Marston is a lovable and complex character who likens his former-self to Robin Hood and his current-self to a simple but honorable husband, though in truth he straddles the line between the good and the bad (and maybe even the ugly when you consider the scars on his hardened face). The characters you encounter are both charming and despicable, and always full of life. You can play as a fearless justice or ravage the land with your cruel deeds; the choice is yours. Horseback-riding is a ton of fun, the visuals, particularly the open plains at sunset, are gorgeous, and the controls are fluid and easy to pick up. The story, gameplay, and exploration will undoubtedly get you hooked. And then there is multiplayer...

In addition to the single-player experience (which includes the exciting zombie-mode, Undead Nightmare) there is a multiplayer mode. Actually, there are more multiplayer modes than I can name here! You choose a character, a horse to ride, and a title that other players will see just for fun, then get dumped in a free roam session, which plays much like the regular game. From there you can carry out missions with other players, verse them in minigames or alternate modes (like capture the flag or horse races), team up with a posse, or simply try to be the last man standing. You earn money for completing objectives or killing people, and the money you earn increases your online level (up to level 50) and allows you to unlock new weapons, mounts (they're not all horses), and titles. Although the online system could be more streamlined (you have to wait until you're in a free roam session before you can enter specific game modes), it is really enjoyable and never boring because of how much there is to do!

In short, Red Dead Redemption is not a game to be missed for open-world game fans, even if you don't enjoy westerns (I didn't think I would until I picked up this title). It is hands-down the best Rockstar title I've played, and I don't remember the last time I grew so attached to a main character. I applaud Rockstar for the top-notch dialogue, voice-acting, and story, on top of the engrossing gameplay. And, with nearly 100 achievements to unlock, this is a game that will keep you coming back for more!",5.0
I can't believe I put off buying this game for years. Its poignant and I actually cared about the main character!! Buy it and enjoy. Its like the F.E.A.R games with a touch of Doc Ock's story mixed in. I'm referring Sam Raimey's Spiderman take on Oct. The Darklings are so vulgar its a pleasure.,5.0

"This game had REALLY high expectations and i think that it lived up to all of them and more.  Take control of Link and get enveloped in the great plot of the game.  the game starts off when your sister is kidnapped by a gigantic bird and you go off with a crew of pirates to save her from Forbidden Fortress.  After that the game really begins as that is your first dungeon.  i won't give anything away but after that you get a talking boat at Windfall Island and your adventure really begins.
aside from the main quest there are tons of side quests which end in ruppees, heart pieces, and treasure maps.  Treasure maps are used to dig...er fish up a treasure chest full of all sorts of stuff.  the game is over 35 hours long and even longer if you collect everything.  It has great replay value because after you beat it there is a save game + which lets you play through again with extra features.
If you are a fan of the Zelda series, or even if your not, then you should definately buy this game.",5.0

"First off let me state that I have owned the Astro A40's, and the PX5's and I enjoy this headset the most. The Astros required battery changes every so often for the mix amp which gets annoying. Its also wired which is annoying, and the sound is only somewhat better than this Sony wireless headset, which is a shame and not worth 250 plus dollars in my opinion.

The Px5's were a great headset. The Sound was pretty much on par with the Astro A40's, and they were wireless which was great! The ONLY problem/deal breaker for these headphones was that they ran on 2.4 GHz wireless channel which was a huge problem for me since I live in an apartment building and almost every wireless router runs on the same frequency which causes the headset to go in and out and lose sound constantly! Super annoying! Other than that the px5's were AMAZING but virtually unusable in my situation and I was very sad to see them go.

The Official Sony 7.1 surround sound headset is just amazing! The sound is almost up there with the Astros and the Px5's, but not quite. But it is barely noticeable. The only thing extra you can here on the px5's and astros is minor things like wind blowing and maybe some animal noises (birds and such), crisper minor details like the sound of the gun firing and reloaading , which on the battle field adds to the overall experience but is NOT something thats going to change the way you play or add any depth of skill. This headset gets the job done! You still experience amazing explosions, which places these headsets near the top of the food chain. And at this price point it is a definite steal! I would have easily paid $150 for the sound quality..but with that said the overall build is sturdy but very plastic like which I do not like. Though it makes for a super light and comfy headset (when its on I cant even feel its weight on my head) I feel like they could have made some things more durable. The retractable mic is what I worry about the most as it wiggles around effortlessly and feels super cheap. The other parts of the headset are also plastic, but feel durable and of good quality. So its basically just the mic I worry about and for that I will be buying a Sqaure trade warranty (very reasonable, and no I do not work for them, I just work too hard to have my money go to waste on something I have bought) for this headset just in case something breaks. Overall I give this headset a 9 out of 10 for sound quality and a 8.5 out of 10 for build and design. VERDICT: BUY THIS HEADSET! Its super easy to set up and the on screen notifications is genius!",5.0
"We have all collectively put over 10 hours bordering 20 into this game(and have beaten it) so i feel as though i have a good perspective on all the characters, adventure packs, etc. I would definitely recommend buying this adventure pack for your Skylander family. Ghost Roaster isn't one of our favorites but i would buy this expansion(essentially thats what it is) because it gives you an extra chapter to play in the game, and the two accessories are very handy. The elixir(on the bottom right of the packaging) gives your skylanders health over a short period of time. You can remove the elixir from the portal of power before its time is up, and use the remaining portion for a later time. You get a full elixir at the beginning of each new chapter and once its run out, you're done for that chapter. The Time Turner(on the top right) slows down time for everything in the game except for you(and your teammate). It also only lasts a short amount of time and is very useful for boss fights. Of the two, i'd saw the elixir is more useful, we use it much more often. As for the bonus level, it took us about 15 min to get through and collect all of the items. For our family, we think it was well worth the $20 since we love the game. If you're a parent buying it for your child, it isn't completely necessary to complete the game...but it makes it just that much better! Your kid will be very happy with it!

The best piece of advice i can offer if you're new to the game: GET AT LEAST ONE OF EVERY CHARACTER TYPE BEFORE YOU BEGIN!!! You need certain elements to get past gates and having all the character elements is key. This includes: Wind, life, undead, water, earth, magic, fire and tech.",5.0

"Gunstar Super Heroes, is one of the best 2D action games developed by Treasure, one of the best, most beloved, and renowned game developers in the world. Tight controls, check. Spellbinding graphics and animation, check. Crazy boss battles that require actual skill to defeat, and gaining satisfaction from said defeat? Check. This game's got it all, and then some. While the overall plot may be a bit obtuse, multiple playthroughs on the difficulty of your choice, will clarify some things. Don't expect a deep storyline because the game is not designed around that, but what it excels at the most is it's frantic and hair-raising 2D action; something Treasure is GREATLY acknowledged for. I can't think of a better 2D action game of this calibre than this game(Astro Boy: Omega Factor and Metroid: Zero Mission comes to mind) but if you want a action game on the GBA, than Gunstar Super Heroes is right up your arsenal. Not only is it one of the best games from Treasure, it's also one of the most insanely fun and ballistic entertaining video games ever made!!!",5.0

"Hello Folks,

I agree with 3D Viking's statements, with a slight tweak.

I would say that if you have the original game, getting this complete edition is really not worth it. But, if you are new to the game, this complete package is well worth it!

This game has a very simple/slick interface, fantastic graphics and sound. Don't expect this to be the COH series, where you have to base build, and take many little control points (circles). This is more of a real time tactical game. The SP campaigns are fun, but MP, especially where you communicate with your teammates, makes the game very fun. Do not look to this game for using the deep reaches of your intellect, or to have your micromanagement needs met. For that go to Men of War, and its clunky interface.

This game is really a ""keep it simple stupid"" in its interface and gameplay. Simple is not dumb, it is fun when you talk to your teammates, or are SPing, and want to relax a bit

"I got this game just yesterday night, so I played it today and there was a huge difference between this and the LEGO star wars series. Here, you start out in Barnett College with a lot of rooms to explore, and if you need extra studs, sometimes you can get a couple hundred by destroying tables and chairs. There are also a lot of characters you can unlock and it is fun playing as them. The levels are definetely challenging but only after a couple of minutes, not too long, you can find out what you have to do or how you should do it. I am only halfway through Raiders of the Lost Ark, and I already got a lot of fun out of it. Like in some cases, you can pick up chairs and throw them at people. Unlike star wars you can pick up items on the floor or left over by previous enemies. The only thing is that after a while they disappear and you can't use them for that long. These are some points on the game...
+ A lot of fun using Indiana Jones' whip and other weapons.
+ Tons of replay value
+ Never get tired of it
+ Challenging levels make it better
+ You can swim, swing, and each character has a different skill

It's also MUCH harder so if you thought yourself a pro and the first incarnation a breeze, if you have an Xbox then try this version.",5.0

"Fantastic game. Firaxis has improved on the last title in replay-ability and the strategic development between boards. I'd also comment that the game, although brutally difficult, delivers an incredibly rewarding game which balances old elements while modifying just enough of it to make the game feel unique. In particular I'd emphasize that firaxis has done a great job at making the enemies diverse in the risks they pose to your squad so that squad tactics need to be modified significantly depending on the enemies approaching your squad. Further XCOM 2 permits a significantly improved weapon and gear customization function. All of these improvements clearly establish XCOM 2 as a fantastic next installment in the gold standard of pc strategy.",5.0

"I initially purchased this game for my Xbox 360 not wanting to spend the additional money on a next gen console until the next Mass Effect game came out. That was my starting reference point for this game, where I did two play-through sessions. The graphics on previous generation console are pretty universally terrible, worse than Origins and certainly lower scale that Dragon Age 2.

Luckily Bioware makes up for it in their signature perks, characters, lore, and story. I was afraid they were going to go over board and make it bigger than it truly had to be. Regarding the PC version, I took a stab at doing a minor upgrade. Using an old Acer Tower (original retail $700) from 2009 and a $150 EVGA GeForce GTX 750 ti SC from amazon I was able to run it was high settings, 1080p and boy what a difference. The textures, the detail, they all go into the immersive feel. Skin is wonderful. Facial animations are still a little off.

Hard to say much beyond tech specs. I will say that compared to console (360 as previously mentioned and PC, also tried it one Xbox One) the load times and glitches even with updates are practically non existent. Except Krem still stands on the chair for some reason. Sit down Krem.",5.0

"Guitar Hero III was the first Guitar Hero game released for the PS3 in 2007. Once again, the game lets the player play through several famous songs from the '60s to 2006. As usual, the player can play with classic characters such as Axel and Johnny Napalm. In addition to these, the game also allows you to play with Slash and Tom Morello. The game also introduced a game mode, which is Battle mode (where you can activate power ups to mess up your opponent). The career set list is also a lot of fun to play through. You'll play everything from classic rock songs, such as Slow Ride, Pride and Joy, Rock You Like a Hurricane, etc, to modern rock, hard rock, and even metal songs such as One by Metallica and The Number of the Beast by Iron Maiden. Other popular music, such as Welcome to the Jungle, Cliffs of Dover, Through the Fire and Flames and Paint it Black, is also featured. So if you have a PS3 and have never played Guitar Hero before or are simply looking for more great Guitar Hero songs, this is a great music game to start with. And if you're still looking for more, head on over to the Playstation Store, where you can find great Downloadable songs from artists such as Boston, Foreigner, Dragonforce, and Metallica. Overall, a really great PS3 game.",5.0

"The best way to review this game would be to ask you the reader: ""Do you like tower defense games like 'Bloons Tower Defense' or 'Desktop Tower Defense'?""  If you can answer yes to either of those games, then you WILL NOT be disappointed.

It's your job as the Ole Ninja Master to setup your ninjas in various locations on the map to stop the oncoming hordes of enemies.  Your ninjas come in different styles and flavors, including fast-but-weaker ninjas, slow-but-stronger ninjas, fireball throwing, ice throwing, pick axe area-of-effect attacking styles... and more.  By strategically upgrading your ninja huts to do more damage and predicting the strength of the next enemy wave, you can keep the baddies at bay.  The game has enough levels to keep you interested, but with a little skill you can actually see the end of this fine game.

I simply cannot recommend this game enough.  Tower defense at it's best for the superb point and click style of the Nintendo DS.  A++++

"I am not a hardcore gamer like a lot of folks that might have reviewed this game already.  In fact, I just bought an Xbox 360 a couple of weeks ago and for the first time signed up for Xbox Live.

After having played both Halo 3 (first) and Gears of War (second), I must say that the game play in GoW is far superior to Halo 3.  I played both Halo and Halo 2 and found myself bored with Halo 3.  There was nothing new about it.

But GoW takes it to another level.  The graphics are great; character movement, both friend and foe, is very smooth and well done; AI is much better than any of the Halos; and the game concept itself, with duck-and-cover being the primary tactic versus blow-and-go, is much more fun to play.

I have played GoW online a few times now and the co-op play is a lot of fun with the differing skill levels of the players adding a new dimension of depth to the game.

A highly rated game.  Probably the most fun I've had with a console since I can't remember when.",5.0

"Can never go wrong with HORI brand accessories. Love this case.

I'll compare it to the 3DS XL case that I still have & use for my 3DS XL. Purchased this new case for my New 3DS XL.

The differences between the 2 cases:

This case holds 6 games, 1 extra stylus, and 1 system. It has an elastic-like band to hold the system in place. Good for if you forget to zip the case closed and it falls. System won't go anywhere. It also has a partition between the games/stylus being held and the system.

The previous case, for the original 3DS XL, holds only 3 games, 1 extra styus, and 1 system. No elastic-like band to hold the system in place. This case also has a pocket inside, which I use for game notes and the AR cards.

So buying this case you can hold 6 games and the system is more secure. The case is also slightly slimmer than the previous 3DS XL case. It lacks the pocket though.

You can also buy the previous case for the 3DS XL, if you'd prefer a pocket for your AR cards, notes, etc. The pocket can't hold too much though.

This case zippers also are a little longer with ""Nintendo 3DS"" printed on them. The previous case uses standard zippers, without any writing on them.

Both cases are great. I like that this one is slimmer. Also, both cases can hold either the old 3DS XL or the New 3DS XL (not both at the same time).",5.0

"I'm just going to copy my review of the Razer Naga Epic, since I compare the mice. I've only had this for about a month or two, so I can't vouch for how well it will last, but I've had no problems so far and I've always been satisfied with Logitech Mice. I highly recommend it for RPG/MMO gamers, or anybody who has other needs for multiple buttons on their mice. Extremely fair price considering the competition. I only hate that it doesn't swap between wireless and wired like the Naga Epic.

Razer Naga Epic Review:
Obviously a good idea for MMO players and hotkey RPG players like myself (I don't play much MMOs though). I used it a lot on Torchlight II which was really handy for fast execution of skills my frost mage. It takes some getting used to where the keys are, but the package comes with ""trainers"" - litter stick on pads for each key to help you know where a key is without looking. The Logitech G600 MMO mouse does something better by angling and separating the 12 keys so you know where the first and 2nd set of 6 buttons are. The problem with this one is after a month or so, I'd have problems where the mouse would not be fully recognized - it would move the cursor, but nothing would respond to clicks. I've had this issue multiple times even after reinstalling the driver, it fixed the issue once before it happened again. I've never had this issue with any mouse cheap or expensive before. This sometimes happens when the computer comes out of standby. This mouse has so much going for it - multiple buttons, lit buttons, software for different mouse profiles, DPI settings, interchangeability between wireless and wired mode, but this mouse cause WAY to much to have any performance issues. Get the Logitech G600, the mouse brand that I've always been able to trust, plus a better button set up and nearly half the price.

"We recently purchased an Xbox 360 game console with Kinect controller.  My wife was concerned about personal security because the Kinect camera is always on, and could in theory be used to spy, despite the fact we could turn off the Kinect controller.  To address the security concern for my wife, I turned off the Kinect and covered it with a dish towel.  While effective, the dish towel solution is not very aesthetically appealing.  So after some research, I found the Pritect Kinect sensor cover.  [...]

Delivery: I was not keen on the additional $3.99 S&H charge, but delivery was timely, arriving in just two days, despite the fact it was not an Amazon Prime eligible product.  So high marks!

Packaging: The packaging is an attractive clear round tube, with foam inserts in the end caps to keep the Pritect cover from rattling around.  The container is sturdy enough to serve as the shipping container.  Again high marks!

Product:  The version I purchased is finished in the same reflective black as the Xbox Kinect controller, though it is offered in other colors.  The cover has felt tabs on the inside that keep it from scratching the exterior of the Kinect's finish.  The cover fits over the Kinect perfectly, and covers the lenses completely.  There is a rectangular hole on the right side, so that the Xbox 360 Logo can be seen.  I give it high marks for finish quality, color matching, and function.

Recommendation: I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is concerned about personal privacy, and wants a better more attractive solution than a dish towel.",5.0

"I LOVE THIS GAME! Admittedly, the campaign is a 80% rehash of Dead Rising 2 except you play as the protagonist in Dead Rising 1, Frank West. The achievements in this game is easier than Dead Rising 2 (DR2). Although this is a rehash, this one is better because of the humor that Frank has picked up compared to the very dry Chuck Greene in DR2. There are a few more new weapons, new bosses and new ending to this one. I also like the fact that they brought back the camera in this version exclusively a Frank West item. Have you taken a 'selfie' with a zombie? You can in this one lol. Play this in Co-Op and you'll have a hell of a fun and easy time beating the game. I like this one better than DR2 also because you have Sandbox mode where you can just explore without having to do any cases (mission). Also everything you do here carries over to the main game so you can level up and get achievements. They also have Challenges that are very fun but hard. I had to look up a lot of it on Youtube but it is worth it. I advise people to get the Sports Man outfit. You can get every achievement with this outfit as I did. If you're debating between buying Dead Rising 2 or Dead Rising: Off the Record, you should definitely buy this one instead. The story is a 80% rehash but you don't get Sandbox mode in DR2.",5.0

"Suffering withdrawal symptoms after finishing GTA V -- and not entirely satisfied with Saints Row IV -- I was delighted to stumble upon this game, which had gotten a good review at IGN some time ago.

This is an awesome open-world third-person shooter with MONTHS of play value!!!

Your character is some kind of South American operative at large in a LARGE island country ruled by evil dictators.  Or something like that -- I'm more interested in the missions and random mayhem than the back story!

The more mayhem you create -- CHAOS! -- by blowing up government installations, the more missions you are awarded by various revolutionary groups scattered around the country.

The controls are spot-on, you have access to lots of weaponry and vehicles -- include choppers and fighter jets -- and the graphics are excellent.  And did I say the country is HUGE?  Well, maybe not as big as the US of A, but it's big enough to encompass a variety of terrain from snow-capped mountains to beaches to lush jungles.

At a price of under $20, the purchase of this game is an absolute no-brainer and IMO one of the best values in gaming.  And I haven't even tried the online multiplayer.

Highly recommended for fans of blast-'em-up shooting action!

UPDATE: I have put in more than 80 hours playing this game so far, and there still is a ton more to discover -- and blow up!  In fact, I saw a message stating that I had only discovered about half the locations available on the island.  That means I can expect more than 160 hours of single-player playtime in this game, and it's all killer, no filler!

IMO this is one of the most fun open-world third-person shooters I have ever played, the lack of funny radio stations in the vehicles notwithstanding.  If you like shooters, you REALLY need to play Just Cause 2!!!  And NO, I don't work for any of the developers responsible for the game...

UPDATE NUMBER TWO: I just have to emphasize my enthusiasm for this game again.  I have played a ton of video games since the days of ColecoVision (!), and I don't know when I have ever spent so many enjoyable hours playing a single game.  I have now put in well over 100 hours of game time here, and the end is nowhere in sight!  The ONLY downside is I know I am going to experience MAJOR withdrawal symptoms when I do finally beat Just Cause 2.  Fortunately I have also heard whisperings that Just Cause 3 will be coming in 2015, and I for one will be elbowing others out of the way to pick up a copy. Did I say this game rocks?  Yes, I did, up, down, over, and under, inside and out.  Scorpio!  Scorpio!  Pick up a copy, and you'll see what I'm getting so excited about.  (And did I mention I'm an old geezer who doesn't get excited about very much these days?)

UPDATE NUMBER THREE: Yikes -- I just passed 124 hours playing this game when I received a trophy ""Halfway Through"" or something like that!  That suggests that the single-player game here can consume 250 hours of your life, delivering the thrills of driving, flying, shooting bad guys, and blowing up the government installations of an evil dictatorship!  All for under $20!  What's not to like here?  And I haven't even tried the online game...",5.0

"I had a lot of fun with this game.  There isn't much I can say which trashcanman didn't cover in his front page review, which actually led to me buying this game in the first place.  My first run through took me about 60 or so hours, and I did all the extra missions and got 900/1000 achievement points. There is a 100 point achievement tied to beating the game in a certain amount of time, I believe 35 hours, which is easily doable from what I've read.

Graphics were sub par but still impressed me at some points.  I really like the character designs, especially Camilla, as she is so hot.

The music can be repetitive at times, but I found it pretty enjoyable.  It can really get you into a battle.

The story is okay, and the premise and concept of the game is very original.

The game play is like Final Fantasy Tactics set during World War 2.  Replace the archers with machine gunners, keep the magic, and there you go.  Well, not exactly but this game has a little bit of everything.  You get a arsenal of weapons, from bazookas to the famous Excalibur sword of legend.  You have a party of wolves that are battling ancient demons, vampires, and zombies.  Do I really have to go on?  Okay, well if you like strategy games and if any of that seems appealing to you then get this game, or at least try it.  One thing to keep in mind, each battle can get really long, and you won't be able so save during these battles, sometimes they go on for over an hour.  The battles are epic in scope and you will have to fight waves and waves are dark forces.  This game takes strategy, wit, and cunning willpower, but I think you can handle it.",5.0

"I had never played a Dead or Alive game before but I had alot of people on my friends list on it so I thought i would give it a go. First of all I would like to say there is a strong learning curve to the game. Having never played a DOA game before I had troubles getting through the stroy mode but i decided to stick with it. I then went online and found myself losing fight after fight so i decided to try the sparring mode. This really helped as i got to learn some combos (button bashing will only give u very limited Success) and got the hang of the countering system. The game then got very interesting and after i had completed the story mode i turned to the online play and soon started winning fights.

The online is the best part of the game although if you have any people with slow connections it does become very laggy. The lobby system is pretty unique as you can walk around as a choosen avatar and talk to other players and form tag teams before you join the fight. The ranking system is also very well done and it helps keep the fights fair although there should be an option to make un ranked lobbies.

Overall I think the game is brillant its very skillful as you have to anticipate moves to counter and learn combos. It has a massive life span (I have played for over 100 hours and am still entertained) and it is very competitive. The only critism I have is that fighting the AI can be frustrating as they will begin countering random moves that you pull if they are losing and the story mode is not exactly extensive. So i would only advise buying this game if you have xbox live or play 2 or 4 player often with friends.",5.0
"If you are considering buying your game, you cannot rely on 2013/2014 reviews. Yes, when the game was released I. 2013, online multiplayer was completely broken and unplayable.  That is no longer the case.  The game now works and plays wonderfully.

Due to the poor initial release, DICE released multiple free multiplayer maps as compensation.  They are incredible maps.

The game is simply fun.  Maps can huge depending on game mode.  Vehicles, upgrades, pickups, etc, fun fun fun.

Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 4 are the top 3 Battlefield games, with Battlefield 1 worming its way into the fray.

There are still plenty of matches to find online.  You won't regret, although the digital version (in the various console stores) has  been on sale for 1/4th the price listed here, and I think most of the DLC has been given away leading up to Bf1 release..  Either way, you won't regret.",5.0

Just found out how to get the move controllers working going to play Rush of Blood tomorrow. Played the hell out of Rigs so much fun and Battlezone is a great game as well. I just love playing Rigs though so cool and everything looks awesome in the VR playing the game.

"I just can't. Yes, this game is not without its flaws: it is a short game; the weapon arsenal this time out is limited and pretty uninteresting; and there are none of these inter-space dogfights and missions that we saw in TOD and CIT.
All of that said, this little game is an absolute charmer. The main storyline, this time with a cackling female antagonist, is tight, interesting and fast paced. The graphics are GORGEOUS, even more impressive than TOD and CIT  (I especially loved the settings for the various missions -- jungle planets, desert planets, swamp planets, all wonderfully crafted and graphically convincing). The gameplay is not much different from CIT, but there a little tweaks to it that keep it interesting (eg. several of the missions require use of a jetpack). In short, its the perfect ending to an excellent series. I would still say Crack in the Time is the best game in the series, but Into the Nexus has its place in the trilogy (well, trilogy + Quest For Booty which is essentially TOD DLC). I would highly recommended it.",5.0

"I love this chic little purse! It's so cute! I can comfortably fit my DS, and several games in it with room to spare. It has inside pockets to keep things separated so they do not scratch up your DS. It also is very adequately padded on the inside and has a nice soft interior that is black. It has a zippered top that zips halfway down the sides, allowing you to easily access your DS inside without having to struggle to get it in or out.
It has a zippered pocket on the outside front of the bag also. The bag has a textured vinyl outside that helps keep it clean but still maintain a very attractive appearance. The zipper tags are a light pewter color with Nintendo's logo embossed in them. A metal emblem of the same color is on the front with the DS logo.
I picked this up in the blue & white color despite having a pink DS and am very happy with the way it looks & performs! It was too cute not to get it! :)",5.0

"I grew up loving Pokemon, I had Red/Yellow/Silver/heart gold/pokemon snap/pokemon stadium, the cards etc. It has been a few years since I have bought/played one of these games. The last one I bought was Heart Gold, and it was just so-so. I found that I wasn't as excited as I was as a kid, which probably is a good thing since I'm a little old to be playing video games anymore. So, I bought my kids some used DS systems, and they came with some games. Pokemon White was one of them. I was sick and down for a good week and decided that I wanted to try the Pokemon White game just for some silly down time. It was like being a ten year old girl all over again, the excitement and wanting to stay up all night playing. I really enjoyed the story, I think if I would have been younger playing this I may not have enjoyed it as much as I did. I think I would have been annoyed with the opposing ideas in the game. But the story gave the game a whole new dimension it didn't have before, enough so to make me excited about pokemon again. I finished this game basically within a week and decided I wanted more! I bought the sequel...But so far it's not as I had hoped. Pokemon White so far has been my favorite out of the pokemon games, and that is saying a lot considering how much I loved Pokemon Snap as a kid. This was a fun way to reconnect to a part of my life that I thought was gone for good. It was fun to put aside my adult tendencies and be an excited kid staying up under the covers with a game all night. My kids are also enjoying that we are going back and watching all the old Pokemon shows, haha. Great game!",5.0

"I basicaly bought this game cuz of the popularity. You know ""everyone who's got a ps3 gotta have Uncharted 2"" So I bought it. I never played the first one. The first chapters of the game were kind of frustrating to me. I couldn't figure where to go or how to avoid the guards. I even thought of returning it. But once I got in the multiplayer mode and advanced the game progress... wow! Addictive Addictive!! I have just a blast every time I play the online mode. It doesnt feel like a war game, its more like a hybrid between adventure and shooting game. Here an example; Kill Zone 2 is great but it feels cold. Uncharted 2 has a cheer feel to it. I hope u know what I mean. This one will be in my collection together with GTA4.",5.0

"This game is great!  It's the only game of it's type on the wii.  Very similar to Phantasy Star Online, except you don't level up and there are no spells or anything.  Everything you have like stats, and passive abilities are based on the equipment you have on.  The ""hunting"" part is not as big as they try to make it.  It's more like Monster Killer than Hunter, but everything about this game is very well done and if you own a wii you shouldn't miss it.",5.0
"If you enjoyed Frontline this is the game for you! From the beginning invasion of Pearl Harbor the graphics are outstanding! Low flying Zeroes, bodies floating in the water, etc. The game play is interlaced with actual footage (between senarios) that keeps you feeling like you are there. The first time a Japanese soldier charged me with a fixed bayonnet my eyebrows went like way up! Game play is challenging enough (Normal mode) and there are enough save spots to keep from going crazy.
Well worth the money!",5.0
"You probably have already heard that Call of Duty 4 is a great looking game, and that it's the best first person shooter on the Xbox 360.  You've probably already heard this a million times, so I won't waste your time by writing a review about the graphics.  By now, you should already know that Call of Duty 4 looks amazing.  I do however, want to share with you a few of the great features that Call of Duty 4 has to offer.

I'll start with CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION for multiplier because this is my favorite feature for Call of Duty 4.  You can choose a preset class with default weapon load outs and perks assigned to them.  Those include Assault, Special Ops, Light Machine Gunner, Demolitions, and Sniper, or you can customize your character by using one of five ""Create a class"" slots, (which you can unlock fairly quick in multiplayer).  Create a Class is a nice feature because you can build your very own soldier with weapons and perks.  Perks are like options to further your Call of Duty 4 character and there are three sets to choose from.  You can only choose one option per set though, (3 perks total) so you'll have to decide which perk will suit your soldier best.  Here's a complete list of perks.

PERKS SET 1: C4 charges, Special Grenades, RPG-7, Claymores (mines), fragmentation grenades, Bandolier (extra ammo), Bomb Squad (detect enemy C4 and claymores).
PERKS SET 2: Stopping Power (increased damage), Juggernaut (increased health), Sonic Boom (increased explosive damage), Sleight of Hand (faster reloading), Double tap (increased rate of fire), Overkill (two primary weapons, but no handgun), UAV Jammer, (undetectable on enemy UAV).
PERKS SET 3: Extreme Conditioning, Steady Aim, Deep Impact (bullets penetrate more objects/thicker cover), Eavesdrop (ability to hear enemy chat when close), Last Stand (when damaged, players may make a ""last stand"" using their handgun), Martyrdom (drop a live grenade when killed), Iron Lungs (hold breath longer for sniper scope view), Dead Silence (less sound when moving).

RANKING up is pretty easy which is great because it allows you to unlock some of the better weapons.  You can also unlock power-ups, such as silencers and sights by obtaining a specific amount of kills for each weapon you use.  Same goes for headshots, which will unlock new camouflage for your weapons.  Complete your quota for both kills and headshots and you'll receive a golden gun for that weapon class.  COD4 also uses a numbering system like Halo 3.  65 Experience Points (XP) is the highest ranking you can get.  Once you hit the 55 points mark, you will unlock Prestige mode, which allows you to trade in your rank and start over at level 1, (you can do this up to 10 times).  What's the point of this?  Prestige baby!  Your ""prestige insignia"" will change each time, letting other players know just how dangerous you really are.

ONLINE PLAY is of course top notch.  There are many game modes to choose from:  Team Deathmatch, Free-for-All, Domination, Ground War, Sabotage, Headquarters, Search and Destroy, Team Objective, Team Tactical, Team Hardcore, Old School, Cage Match, and Oldcore.  Along with the great game modes to choose from, there are many new and different ways to engage the enemy.  For instance... Get 5 kills in a row and you can call in an airstrike, (similar to Battlefield 2 Modern Combat).  Get 7 kills in a row and you can call in a helicopter to fly over and unleash a barrage of bullets to the enemy from a side mounted chain gun.  This makes the game a lot of fun in the sense that you're not just fighting foot soldiers all the time.  It's fun to take down a helicopter now and then.

THE CAMPAIGN is very well done.  COD4 does a nice job of making you feel as if you're really there.  A teammate will blow open a door by firing a shotgun at the door jams, another one kicks it in; you blast into the room firing short bursts at bad guys from your silenced MP5... You get the idea... It's just plain and simple Call of Duty fun!

People will no doubt try to compare this game to Halo 3, Rainbow Six Vegas, Gears of war and maybe even Bioshock.  Thing is, is that the Call of Duty games have always been great games, so to try and compare it to any other game on the market really isn't necessary.  It's a different animal.  The Call of Duty series will continue to win awards and capture the eye of many if not all first person shooter fanatics.  It's one of those weird things, where you know if you go out and buy it... You'll love it.  It's as simple as that!

"World of Warcraft, now a veteran on the market, is one of the most successful RPGs of all time. In its latest installment, we're taken to a whole new continent full of a race of Pandas who are based on Chinese culture.

The Good:

1. Monks - The monk class is extremely interesting, able to fill all roles and with some mechanics that are new to WoW. A healer monk (mistweaver) is the highlight as you can actually melee things to heal your group. In fact, one of the best high-end raid strategies for a healer monk involves him spending almost the entire fight doing melee DPS while healing. This is being referred to as ""fistweaving"", and it's one of the most powerful healing techniques in the game as of the time of my writing this.

2. The Presentation - The game has a lot more speech and much better storytelling in the quests. The zones are beautiful, and the new models are perfect. The main gripe still is that old player models need an update.

3. The Raiding - WoW is still the best game out there for a MMO PVE raiding experience. In other words, the endgame 10-25 man boss fights are incredibly well designed and fun compared to the competition. The game still has a healthy raiding community with thousands of guilds vying to be the top guild on the wowprogress website. Looking For Raid tool allows solo players to see the raids in a dumbed-down version, but the content is similar enough that it prepares new players for the real thing. No other MMO on the market has a system like this. The raiding experience really sets this game apart.

The Bad:

1. Daily Quests - This is an issue that Blizzard has acknowledged, so it's expected to improve over time. The problem is that players are pushed to progress by participating in daily quest chains which are very boring. You must do these in order to unlock the vendor gear that you're going to want to be an effective raider. While it's totally possible to be a successful player without doing daily quests, it would take you a lot longer to gear up. Even though Blizzard claims they will make this less necessary, I am disappointed that the quests are so boring. They could have had a lot fewer quests and just stuck with the fun ones like the bombing runs, gunning mini games, racing mini game, and other similar quests. Right now those are diluted by hundreds of kill and fetch quests. It's not a bad thing to have to go out there and kill things, but killing 12 non-elite mogu every day gets very boring. Killing a big boss every day is much more fun.

2. Talents and glyphs - Talents and glyphs are mostly impotent these days, and do not significantly alter the way you play your class. The only reason this isn't gamebreaking is that there are so many classes and class specializations to choose from, and all of them are viable these days. While the talent tree may have felt more complex in Vanilla WoW, you could only pick one role to fill for your class in a raid. Now you can pick any role. Druids alone could fill 4 different roles if they wanted, and with success. I'm still putting this down as bad because any MMO is going to be better with more player control over their character. I would like at least a little more control over how my spec plays.

3. PVP - PVP in WoW is basically instanced battlegrounds, some of which are the same things you've been doing since 2007. I want more maps for the same game type. After all these years, we're still running the flags across the same Warsong Gulch. No thanks. WoW's PVP is not exactly subpar for the genre, but it's clearly taking a backseat to raiding.

Final Words:

In the end, I still give this game a 5 star rating. If you want a huge role playing game to play with millions of people, WoW is still the best one. Other games like Guild Wars 2 have made the questing more fun and the world more alive, but nobody tops the WoW endgame raid experience or the exceptional class design. When it comes down to it, I'd still rather play WoW for the long haul.",5.0

"If  Dead Rising , Saints Row and Jet Set Radio had a 3-sum
Sunset Overdrive would be ""there"" love child from that wild night of passion
there is nothing really like it on any other platform
I don't understand how there's less then 300 reviews on this under-rated gem  but, there are 1,341 customer reviews for Destiny
Gamer's are so clueless in the eighth generation of home consoles

Sunset Overdrive is so fun and close to perfect it's a real must play experience!

Graphics: A+ it's a flawless looking title this is the best looking game Insomniac Games has put out to date!

Story: is a strange hybrid of the Dead Rising games and the Saints Row games
the story is very sharp with smart writing
This is a new IP but, it could easily be a new long running series if the story continues down this road

Controls: are smooth, the set-up and how you do various things will take a bit getting use to  (The weapon wheel is a bit strange @ first)

you can get it for less the original SRP now so anyone with a XBOne should have this title

"My husband bought this as we both love role playing games. We LOVE that we can play together to get the storyline- we have two kids so we don't get out much but it gives us something to do together once the kids are in bed.

The storyline is okay, and I love the way the game is played- you have a scenario and you each pick a character to play. The game recommends which would be good for particular scenario. Your travel  the scenario map meeting different goals that pop up, but also trying to wipe out the enemy army. I like the flexibility to change which character I play so I can try different weapons and special moves.

My complaint with storyline is just that I don't feel eager for the story as much as the actual gameplay. Not sure if that will make sense to anyone, but I've played some games that the story itself leaves you riveted and eager to get to next cut scene. Still giving it 5 stars though!",5.0

I can't wait to get my hands on Zen Garden, don't understand why we can't?!  Like didn't they produce enuff?  Are they seriously sold out like that?  Or is it some kind of ruse to make it a ""collectible"" and jack the price up? hmmm....Anyone that does get their hands on it, I would suggest you don't let it go, it would be a nice series to have in your collection since all the games on each one are different in their own way!

"Despite only being able to hook up to a CR TV the atari flash back 2 should be treasured for as old as the system it is. Porting all the greats from the Atari 2600's time. Atari Climber Asteroids Centipede and more it has a charm that will never be matched. Before we had game systems like the Wii PS3 and XBox 360 there was tons of other game systems. ColecoVision. Intellivision, The Odyssey and Atari 2600. (As well as many many others.) If you value games from the past alot pick this up. This was the systems of the past. And for a treasure like this to creep into the 21st Century is extremely rare to find. Own it before it fades away into nothing but a memory to capture the greatness of games from the past. On another positive note, You can also unscrew the joystick on the Atari controllers for carrying them around on trips which make them very accessible for travel because the screw inside the controllers are made of solid Metal. So no easy breaking. Overall I give this console a 8.5 for design it resembles the 2600 almost exactly a little smaller yes but otherwise still as satisfying. Pick one up Its worth the money.",5.0

"I am a VERY old-school gamer and the last brand new home console system that I purchased was the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. I lost interest in the gaming scene after the Dreamcast died out. Reason being I didn't care much for 3-D polygonal games. I was bred on 2-D sprite based graphics. My very first system was the 2600 my parents got me in the early 80's. I've had almost every system ever since (between early 80's and 1999, I've had the Sega Master System, Turbo Graphix 16, Commodore 64, Super Nintendo, 3DO, Neo Geo, Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis, PS 1, etc..).

When the original PS 2 came out, I was skeptical. I knew that the eventual games being released at the time would not be of any interest to me. As it turned out, I was right. All the similar polygon-based games catering to the teenage male crowd was extremely boring to me.

However, around the middle part of the new millenium, I began noticing a nice amount of retro arcade collections for the PS 2. One example being the Capcom Classics collection. A large gathering of over 20 Arcade games for around 20 bucks. Remember, I came from a time when you paid 50 dollars for an inferior reproduction of 1 arcade game for a home console.

I also caught wind of a new redesinged PS 2 that wasn't all that larger than it's own controller. When I actually saw it, I was pretty impressed with the compact shape and looks of the new system. I still held out though. Not enough compilations to warrant the purchase of a new system.

But, several factors finally changed my mind. Additional compilations were being released, the one from Taito really caught my interest. There were even home console collections being released; I am talking about ones with a wide selection of games for a nominal price. Sony also dropped the price of the system. And finally, the release of this Silver colored system. I was sold.

I've had this system for about 4 days. First of all, looks really pretty. Love the silver color. The size is very compact. Very nice for my space challenged apartment. Of course, the system works with all my old PS 1 games along with the PS 1 memory cards. Load time for my PS 1 games is a lot faster. The controller feels nice and durable.

I've been enjoying games such as Ghost & Goblins, Super-Off Road, and Gladiator for the last several days. I am glad that I decided to purchase this new PS 2 system. Compact size, affordable price, and overall hugh selection of games. Whether you are into retro gaming or not, it is hard to go wrong with this system.

UPDATE- Just to clear up a potential confusion, despite what Amazon listed on their page for this PS 2 system, I did buy this from Amazon and the Sony Playstation 2 that arrived at my doorsteps is the North American NTSC format; NOT the European PAL version. So yes, this system plays all U.S. PS 2 games. Otherwise its been just over a week since I've had this system and I cannot wait to order Capcom Classics vol 2, Sega Genesis collection, and the Metal Slug Anthology. Keep the classics coming!

UPDATE(2)- I've had this system for about 2 years now and although the release of retro-collections are slowing down, I've had a blast with every collection that was released. SNK seems to be the last company to pump out a compilation here and there; I'll enjoy it while it last.

UPDATE(3)- 2 and a half years and I am still enjoying the system. Recently, I've been introducing my girlfriend to my large retro-gaming collection on the PS 2. She really enjoys the Namco stuff such as Dig Dug and Mappy. She also likes some of the Taito stuff. Good times!

UPDATE(4)- Lately I've been exploring the import shoot-em-ups market. Some of my favorites include Strikers 1945 1+2 and Gunbird 1+2. Still rolling with the PS2 after 3 years.

UPDATE(5)- 3 1/2 years with the PS2. Haven't had much of a chance to play recently. But when I do have a moment, I still play Mappy with my girlfriend to see who can beat the high score.",5.0

"There is an eshop sale going on until 91/14 on all ATLUS games. This is $19.99.  I HATE voice acting for anything Japanese because the English never is able to match the quality of Japanese what with its many quirks. However, SMT 4 has one of the BEST VOICE ACTING I HAVE EVER HEARD. It is God like, superb, exceeding of expectations. I would even go so far to say that it was as good as Fire Emblem Awakening's voice acting, and that is hard to top IMPO. I am not a fan of Bryce Papenbrook, but he really proves that he is worthy of his title with his character Issachar.  There is no Japanese track, but as a huge fan of Japanese subs, I am not disappointed. I seriously am in love with the English voice cast.

Speaking of love, this game! It has this dark atmosphere to it, the design, while not graphically the best is attractive after seeing it for yourself. One of the reasons, (albeit very stupid) I wasn't keen on buying this, was the look of the game. Lame, right? I am so stupid. This game is so gorgeous to me now after playing only 8 hours. Though I would like more exploration, I do understand that this game is mostly about demons so I cannot complain there.

Now from what I have heard from many who've played this, and also were SMT fans ( most notably Persona) is the complaint of the story and characters. For a newcomer to the series, and one who likes exploring deep controversial subjects such as religion, caste systems, ideologies, etc. I was in heaven. Which could also be a bad pun for this games story line and Johnathon, who I literally think is handsome, sexy, and OMG YOUSOPRETTYWHYDON'TYOUEXIST!!!!!????

I can see why this story might turn you away. However, I don't believe you can every truly judge anything if you've no experience first hand. I came into this game after getting it on sale, thinking, well, maybe it will be a good passtime. NO.  The difficulty level is very easy to scare you away, but for some reason I only died once, and never changed the difficulty. BUT this doesn't at all mean it won't be challenging to many. You literally have to save every time you battle, which I did because the demons will just RUSH at you and you freak out when you didn't see it before.

Since I am only 8 hours in and have had much spoiled for me, what I can give you is an earnest recommend. I didn't fancy this as my cup of tea, but here I am, comparing this to the glory of Fire Emblem. After I play some Persona games, maybe I will see why such hardcore fans don't believe this a strong game. However, for a newcomer who has virtually no idea what this game is about, it is the perfect entry way to becoming a fan of this deliciously dark and well-written journey with demons. Plus, your actions in this game can lead to 4 DIFFERENT ENDINGS. Yeah.

Cons: That map system....pretty bad, not the worst, just....yeah.
Cliche characters (though it is supposed to be that way)

Pros:
The characters (oddly enough, cliche they may be, it serves its role and makes it an intriguing story)
Gripping atmosphere
GREAT soundtrack and voice acting
Johnathon is just so hot. (Walter fans will heartily disagree, which I have no problem with. Walter is pretty fine)
Your decisions will lead to one of four endings
Addictive

"Probably the last Assassins Creed worth owning until Origins comes out. Sailing is a blast and finding the sea shanties to get your crew to learn other songs is a lot of fun. This is also one of the few Assassins Creed games to feature a Piece of Eden and move the meta, real world story forward in a weird but satisfying way. Would totally recommend if you are dying waiting for Origins to release later this year.",5.0

"The game reminds me of some horror movies like The Cabin in the Woods, Evil Dead, and a few other horror movies from the 90's. Storyline is really good, flows well through out the game. Graphics are really impressive, audio is amazing.
 I do love the feature of how you can have the character look around their surroundings, by moving the entire controller around, which isn't done in some games. I also like that it's similar to the choose your own adventure type of style game.
It may not take long to play, only about a day or 2, depending how long you spend on playing games, but worth the money to play.",5.0

"I love this game more than all the other godzilla games out there. It reminded me of destroy all monsters and the monster island map is great. But they should of had more monsters. Biolonte was supposed to be in this game and so was the smog monster. I feel they also should of had the origional mechagodzilla in it to. When I read that godzilla unleashed had all the monsters you would want like varan,titanasauris and manda,i was so exited it was like a dream come true. The perfect godzilla game,or so I thought. I bought the ps2 version and got so mad. They put all the primitive monsters in the ps2 version and saved all the new monsters for the wii version. And they put manda and the smog monster in the DS version. I even read that gamera,the friend of all children was gonna be in it to. But I'll save all my complaints for that review. Over all,this is a great game. King Kong was gonna be in this game to,yeah a monster that origionally WAS NOT a toho monster,but with king kong vs godzilla and king kong escapes,I guess he is.if you just want to check this game out,RENT IT.if you want to buy it,then buy the x box version cause it plays on x box 360.my persional opinion on this game is its better than all the other godzilla games.you can fly in space with mogera and its the first time you can go under water since super godzilla. If you all ready have this game,godzilla unleashed is its sequel.",5.0
"Let's face it: Size matters. Less clutter. Less bulk.

I had the original, fat Playstation 2 before owning this one, so I know all about oversized consoles (*cough* XBox*). It's hard to believe that the same (if not better) technology is in this newly redesigned slim version of one of the most famous gaming consoles. On top of that, it comes with ethernet, and the disc tray is different than the original. Loading times seem to be a little better but nothing to celebrate.

This version is worth buying even if you have a Playstation 2 already. Just sell your fat one (you can probably get around 45 for a fatty) and buy the slim one. It's very compact (the pictures don't do it justice, trust me) and it will encourage you to take your console everywhere (long trips, friends' houses, etc.).",5.0

"Acrobatic and electric, inFamous is fun from beginning to end.  After a mysterious accident gives him his awesome electrical powers and destroys most of the city, protagonist Cole must navigate his way through the ruins of the city to unravel the mystery behind the destruction and what part he played in it.  I use the term protagonist because Cole does have several opportunities to choose which moral path he can follow.  He can choose to be benevolent and use his powers to save his fellow citizens or intimidate and crush those that oppose him.  The story essentially follows the same arc regardless of which moral choices you pick but some of the subplots and side missions will be affected by those choices.  Either way you will end up will a truly awesome array of powers and the chance to roam the decimated city at your leisure.  One thing that the creators did note, and that I found on my playthoughs, is that the hero path is more difficult.  There are more defensive/escort missions on that path and collateral damage can be your worst enemy.  The tight free-running controls and intense powers make this a real pleasure to play.  Highly recommended.",5.0

"Super R-Type is extremely addictive. Unlike most space shooters, it is not insanely difficult. Some obsticles may take a few tries, but they are always fun.

"Yu-Gi-Oh: Dungeon Dice Monsters is the 2nd YuGiOh game for the GameBoy Advance(GBA). It is different than the regular YuGiOh card games, but its still fun.
In Dice Monsters, you battle various opponents in tournaments and free duels using dice. Dice can be monsters or items. 15 dice are used for each battle.
The rules are pretty simple to learn. You choose 3 dice and roll them. If 2 or 3 of them match up with the same number of summon stars, you summon a monter and ""dimension""(place) it on the field. Each dice has 6 sides, so even if you don't summon, you can still get attack crests or other ones to use later on.
Each monster is a certain type, and has 1 type that its strong against and 1 type its weak against. Very simple to remember, since there is only a few types of monsters in the game.
Your goal is to attack the ""Die Master"" of your opponent, and kill its 3 heart points. To do this, you must summon monsters and build a path to it.
There is over 100 dice in the game, and about 100 opponents in all in the game!
Opponents are fought in tournaments first, then once you beat them, they are in free duel. In free duel, you can battle them as much as you want. Each win, earns you 1 dice. You can buy or sell dice from Grandpa at the shop at anytime. Once you beat more tournaments, you will unlock more dice to buy at the shop, and even more tournaments will appear.
Alot of replay in the game, very fun for YuGiOh fans and non-YuGiOh fans also. Simple rules and pretty fast most of the time. Only downfall is some duels can last a while, the dice rolls are random and it sometimes can take a while to summon the right monsters.",5.0

"This does one thing and it does it well. It adds an extra 6 feet (1.8288 meters) to your Gamecube controller cable, which is also 6 feet (1.8288 meters) giving you a total of 12 feet (3.6576 meters,) using an original Gamecube controller. It connects tightly with the controller and into the Wii/Gamecube, if your Wii supports Gamecube (newer Wiis do not.) I used to be able to play games from only one spot on one couch but now I can play from any seat on any couch and that makes me immensely happy, something that any gamer with an all too short wired controller can understand.

"I got my Sony PSP about two weeks ago to compliment my new 60 GB PS3. I was very excited about the new Remote Play function that will allow me to access all of my music, movies, and photos saved on my PS3 via a wireless connection from anywhere in the world.

After I told my friend that I was getting a PSP, he told me that he was able to use homebrew software to run NES, Genesis, and SNES emulators! I did my homework and now I'm playing the classic SNES version of Chrono Trigger on my PSP! I can play Zelda, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario, Contra, Metroid, you name it. I'll bet your Nintendo DS can't do that...

The Sony PSP boasts, hands down, the nicest screen of ANY hand held device on the market. iPod video? Please... Microsoft Zune? Yeah right. Take a good look at the screen. It's SWEET! Movies on this screen look AWESOME. Yeah, obviously UMD movies are around the same price as DVD's and its a propriety format, but they pump out pretty good quality. I have 3 UMD's of classic movies I would watch on the road. Am I going to buy a lot more? No. But they're nice to have around. Besides, you can download movies onto your Memory Stick Duo...

I bought a Sandisk 4 GB Memory Stick Pro Duo for my PSP. That way I could fit music, movies, pictures, games, whatever...Did I mention that you can now play original Playstation games on this machine now too? Right now you need a PS3 to play them, but if you do your homework and get OS 3.03 OE-B installed...then you too can play copies of your PS One library. Final Fantasy VII or Metal Gear Solid on the go anyone?

The games for the PSP are getting MUCH better now too. Metal Gear Portable OPS, Tekken Dark Resurrection, and Syphon Filter Dark Mirror really push the system graphically. Most importantly, these games have been designed specifically within the limitations of ""portable games"". These are not LAZY PS2 ports...In fact, many of the games are no longer ports. A year after launch the games are getting significantly better in my opinion.

Yes this system is expensive. But not as expensive as you think. Here's the breakdown of what I got and how much I paid.

1) Sony PSP- $150 sale

2) 4 GB Memory Stick Duo- $90 sale

3) Tekken DR and Syphon Filter- $32 off of eBay

4) 200 SNES, NES, and Sega Genesis classics- FREE!

5) My old PS One games- FREE!

6) Nyko Theater Experience Case- $40

I paid 325 for a PSP with 4 GB, 2 great PSP games, a HUGE library of classics to play from, and a hard case with built-in speakers, stand, and 7 hour lithium-ion battery that can charge the PSP.

You can do all of this, go online, play wireless with others for free, listen to music, watch videos on the nicest portable screen around, and access data on your PS3 from anywhere (by the end of the year Sony claims). I think it's wicked cool and I think you should agree with me. In the last week I have convinced two of my managers at work to get a PSP. They, like me, are loving every second with it. In fact, I use it more than my PS3 and my Xbox 360 right now.

Potential? Ha! There's potential. Go out and unlock some gaming goodness for yourself too!",5.0

"Fun game.  Controls and moves are easy to learn, nice graphics, good story, length is fine.  Where the game really shines is in its puzzles, environments, and level design.  It seems a lot of thought went into these, especially in the Jan Mayen Island and Arctic Sea levels and the Lara's Shadow add-on (all of which are fantastic).  Criticisms that the levels are confusing are overstated IMO.  You do have to explore the area to figure out what to do next but that's part of the appeal of adventure games.  My only complaint is that the camera angles fly here and there (I would like to give the game a 4.5 out of 5 for this reason) but it's not bad enough to be frustrating (just mildly annoying).

I paid full price for the game when it was released last year and don't regret it.  At $20, it's a bargain for fans of the series or anyone who is looking for an alternative to first person shooters.",5.0

And then I'll play another round.

Hot Shots courts you initially with its whimsical charm, easy-breezy graphics, and pick up and play accessibility; however, once you slip the ring on, forget about it.  It starts demanding impossibilities; it wants you to wear clothes that are unreasonably expensive, it wants you to buy the newest clubs, even though you don't need them -- I don't need them, why do you want me to buy them??  And before you know it, you're buying pictures of people you don't even care about; music you can't listen to because it's been disabled, and time spent you'll never get back ... you'll never get any of this time back.

Hot Shots doesn't care.

In short, do you like addictive games?  Are you the person that needs to own every outfit, even if you don't play the character?  Do you like mastering gameplay mechanics that are affected by variables outside of your control?  Me too!  You'll love Hot Shots golf, even if you don't like watching golf, or playing Tiger Woods.  It's more Golden Tee and Neo Turf Masters, which is a good thing.

They're seven ranks to climb, match play, training, and my favorite, online play, where you can doll up your avatar with goofy nonsense no one should care about, or hop right into the daily tournament and see how you fair against the world's top players.  If you're anything like me, the answer is poorly.

it is an awesome game if you played the other digimon worlds it's alot like digimon world 3 and pokemon XD mixed. Gameplay is awesome it was weird at first but once you play it and get used to it it is pretty fun. A plus for me is that the digimon can become several different digimon if the person wanted kinda like digimon world 3 for example lalamon is the second digimon you get i liked it as a healer but i had to keep doing support commands to get it to want to heal anything. so later i got it to be able to become gatomon so i stuck with that. so basically if you don't like a certain digimon you can swicth for a different one.,5.0

"There have already been some excellent reviews of both the good and bad parts of this game, so rather than repeat what everyone else is saying, I wanted to point out a few aspects of the game that haven't received as much attention.

Pros:
 - Much better storytelling. I know that some people are disappointed by the lack of an overarching quest, or a main antagonist, but I love the fact that Bioware is trying something new here. This time around, the story is told in bits and pieces, with apparently minor sidequests actually laying the foundation for the bigger conflicts to come. At first it's confusing, but in the end you really get a sense of the scope of the story. Bonus points for the story-within-a-story framework, which is rarely intrusive but does create a couple of genuinely funny moments.

 - A darker plot. In Origins (which I loved), the plot could basically be summed up as ""Wow, that's an evil demon, we'd better kill it."" This time around, the goals aren't so simple. Trying to be a nice guy sometimes has unexpected consequences, and the bad guys frequently have good points to make. Your companions, too, are much more morally ambiguous - good people do terrible things, and most of the time you're powerless to stop them.

 - There are now cooldown times for potions. I know some people hate the new, faster combat (I did at first, but eventually came to enjoy it), but the potion cooldowns help to keep the battles more strategic. You can't just send your tank in to kill a dragon and have her chug potion after potion; she can drink a potion, and a mage can heal her, and then you'd better find something else to distract that dragon for a while. Generally speaking, I found the combat to be easier in this game, but when the enemies really start swarming, there's something incredibly satisfying about making your party work together to take everyone out.

 - Tactics are much improved this time around. Not only do you have more tactic slots, but you have more options. For example, you can set up your tank to activate a defensive sustained skill when there are a lot of enemies nearby, and then deactivate that and change to a more aggressive skill when the number of enemies decreases. Party members can also change tactics based on how many in your party are unconscious (dead), which is a huge help.

 - The dog is now a summon rather than a party member. Consequently, I now use the dog, which I never did in Origins.

Cons:
 - The game starts very slowly. All of your companions are initially kind of grumpy, and while that makes your developing relationships more rewarding, it also means that you spend the first few hours of the game with snippy people who don't seem to like you much. Plus, combat is pretty dull until you learn a few spells/talents.

 - Bioware annoyingly removed two sections of the journal: the transcripts of recent conversations, and the statistics page. Boo! The transcripts were pretty handy if you missed a bit of dialogue, and the stats were just plain fun.

 - The romances feel a bit rushed at the end, which is a shame because they start out very well. At the end I could ""complete"" my romance by promising to stay with my love interest, or I could dump him. Suffice it to say that by the end, I really needed an option like, ""Um, we need to have a serious talk about a few things.""

 - Reusing maps. Yeah, everyone mentions this but it needs to be noted. That said, it's not nearly as heinous as it was in Mass Effect, where the most sophisticated people in the galaxy somehow only managed to design two buildings.

 - No title cards at the end to tell you what happened to people. It made the end of the game seem very abrupt. Then again, I suspect that Bioware has learned to be wary of the end-game wrap up, because Awakenings and now DA2 contradict that information with some frequency. Yes, I am slightly miffed about the ""crazy templar"" from Origins who seemed entirely normal in DA2.

 - I got ""The Exiled Prince"" as part of my free upgrade, but trust me: you do not want to pay extra for this DLC. Yes, you get a new party member (Sebastian), but he's annoying, judgmental, and does nothing in a fight that Varric can't do better. I've heard that Sebastian can actually be a love interest, but who in their right mind would want him?

It's hard for me to score this game, because I agree with a lot of the criticism being leveled against it. On the other hand, a friend called me as I nearing the end of the game and I told him that I couldn't talk because a character just tried to give away his pillow and you KNOW that is bad news. (On a side note, my friend now thinks I'm crazy.) I don't give five-star reviews because a game/movie/book is perfect, because it never is; I give it a five-star review if it manages to temporarily transport me to another world where I care about the people and their problems. So for all its issues, this is a five-star game for me.

Update:
First I must apologize, because I wrote this review after one playthrough, during which I apparently managed to dodge a number of major bugs. If I had known about them (most notably the friendship bugs for two of your companions), I would have dropped my score. As much as I love this game - and I do, to a ridiculous degree - there's just no excuse for that lack of QA. Still, if you haven't picked up the game yet and you're worried about the bugs, you should know that Bioware has released a patch for each platform that fixes the worst of the issues (and you can now be friends with everyone), and a second patch for smaller bugs is also in the works.

Also, because I received the free upgrade, I didn't realize that the dog is actually part of the Black Emporium DLC. It's kind of lame that you don't automatically get him. I don't know what they're charging for that DLC, but if it's cheap then it might actually be worth getting. The dog is handy, especially in a few locations where you can find yourself with less than a full party. The Emporium itself is just a shop - they can stick it in your quest log all they want, it's not actually a quest - but it does offer a few interesting items. More importantly, it allows you to change your character's appearance whenever you want. This was a huge plus for me, because in the past I've re-started games (and wasted a lot of time) just because my character looked different in-game than it did on the creation screen. This is a great feature and I really hope that other games start using it...but again, I don't really agree with charging extra for it.",5.0

"This brilliant adventure game has Jen as an intelligent 21 year old woman who learns she has supernatural powers - and must use them to keep the world from ending.
There are many ways in which this game shines. First and foremost, the plot and environment in which the adventure takes place has a huge attention to detail. Jen and her boyfriend are into the nightclub scene - he's a heavy metal singer - and the way in which the movie opens really draws you in. The club they're in looks exactly like a few I've been in.
The characters are extremely realistic, smart and savvy. This isn't a brainless bimbo having to 'learn about life'. Sure, she doesn't know about her supernatural powers at first, but she's quick on the uptake and takes care of herself. This is definitely a chick that girls can look up to and that guys will want to get to know.
Along comes Scree, a fun gargoyle that gives her a hand. The combination of Jen's abilities and Scree's special powers makes the puzzle solving and adventures even more fun, as you figure out which would be better in a situation. Yes, there's some fighting. But this is NOT a button-mashing game. The intro sequence definitely sets the pace. This is more like an interactive movie in which you actively affect the plot, rather than a run-around-gathering-coins brainless activity.
There are different worlds and different characters you meet, and the PS2's graphics have really been tested in this game. The heat waves that rise from torches, the steamy breath in the wintery world, the reflective lighting, the detail on the characters - it's all extremely impressive and helps immerse you in the game.
The sound is great too. Unlike other games that feel you need an action-packed thumping soundtrack while you explore a quiet environment, this game gives you the soft noises you'd expect - very realistic ones at that. It makes the times where something is jarring - like the snarl of a nearby monster - really affect you. The Heavy Metal thumping only jumps in during battles, where it doesn't seem intrusive.
The game definitely isn't for the wham-bam-thank-you-maam type of gamer. Puzzles won't be solved in 3 seconds by jumping up platforms. You have to really examine your environment and consider what might help you out. Which is good for most gamers, but will be frustrating for gamers raised on instant gratification.
Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game is that it wasn't QAed thoroughly enough before release. The game had numerous problems with freezing up and stuttering speech, meaning that I had to save frequently to ensure lots of work was not lost. Perhaps it's understandable with a game this complex, but another month of testing and fixing would have been well worth it.",5.0

"This game has come up in my Amazon recommendations since shortly its release last year. Due to the cover art, I'd dismissed it as purely a game for kids. You know, something hokey, not very challenging, and probably more annoyance than anything. WRONG!

As I've found it increasingly difficult to get out of the house for exercise (heat wave, allergies, sun in my eyes, planets not in alignment, etc.) the pounds have piled on. So I went in search of a fun, low-impact 'exergame' to use with our Wii. The rave reviews and discussions in Amazon's forums convinced me to give this one a try. Man, I wish I'd bought it back when Amazon first recommended it to me!

The game is fun, and thanks to both the visual distractions (chips to collect and cash in on event capsules that populate your island with decor) and the rhythmic music (lots of bouncy songs), it's incredibly easy to forget you're exercising. Until the sweat starts dripping, that is, and even then the game pulls you forward in search of more capsules, more rainbow spheres, and more things to discover. It's just a blast, and yet it gets your blood pumping! Before I even realized it, I'd walked for 45 minutes to reach 5,001 steps. (Possibly more. I was having problems with my nunchuck.)

Now that I can exercise any time, day or night, without worrying about the weather forecast, the pollen count, irritating teenagers shouting rude things about my weight (assuming I work out when my kids are at school) or any of the other thousand excuses I can come up with to avoid working out.

But, as I mentioned, I was having problems with my nunchuck. I'm going to keep trying to use it for a few more days, and may try this with my Wii balance board (since I don't use it for anything anymore, LOL). Still, something tells me I'll be springing for one of those DDR mats... or maybe two, so my son can walk with me.

Well done, Konami! Now, get off of YOUR sofa and make the next release of this game!!!",5.0
"I never played the original Portal game.  I played similar game concept via Darksider and I loved it.

First of all, I am the kind of person who get sick play video games of certain engine, and Portal 2 get me sick, but this is still a fun game.

I haven't finished it yet, and the challenges are getting harder and more fun as I progress.

If you want a brain challenging game, not just the regular shoot and kill, this is the game for you.",5.0
"It's a gamecube controller what more can I say?!

I was hesitant enough to buy two of em coming all the way from japan! even though they were like $30 each I ended up buying two, and I thought I was better off doing that because ones here in USA are like about $100 for a brand new one which I thought they were out of their minds for that kind of price range. And used ones were around $20 with most of em being worn with rubber tops ripped off.

So I decided to buy these even though they came all they way from Japan, And boy I was not sorry for spending my money on these controllers. I still haven't opened one yet but i already have on the other one. Cause i already have 2 other controllers. I mainly bought these cause I wanted to play Smash Bros Melee properly cause I have another used genuine one but it's heavily worn. So if your looking for some genuine GameCube Controllers for your Wii or Gamecube then look no further and buy these babies!! :)",5.0

"Used to play this back in the day when it first came out it was amazing then and still is, if you like the blade runner movie you will love this game, takes place during the events of the movie but you play as a different character and follow a different storyline that connects  slightly to the movies events, I really think the game is way better than the movie. It also has multiple endings at least 4 wich is great. A lot of replay value and good voice acting.  Honestly I could go on and on about how awesome it is but I'll spare you.......Must buy!",5.0

"Since PS2's and PS3's use the exact same composite or component cable, I figured this would work........ guess I was wrong. For more info read this review, not typing it all again:

http://www.amazon.com/review/R11MCQ8ESC5A3J/ref=cm_cr_rev_detup_redir?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B0017O5K0I&cdForum=Fx2RJZ1HUJHT04O&cdPage=1&cdThread=Tx158CF6U8RXSNC&newContentID=Mx1SF4QCPZ70QCN&newContentNum=3&store=pc#Mx1DX5EI2D5FV5N

EDIT!!: lol ok changing my review...... maybe the red video cord wasn't plugged in all the way or some weird crap, cause I unplugged the cords one by one and plugged them back in and when I hit the red one and plugged it in again..... poof I had color. I don't know..... but holy hell what a difference on my Sony Bravia. In Final Fantasy 12, things were so fuzzy on composite cable (the PS2's OFFICIAL composite cable, red/white/yellow) it looked ugly as hell. With this? it's as clear as it is on the CRT TV we still have in the living room....  but I did go to the ingame options and turn on flicker filter (keeps it from getting fuzzy when you/the camera move)then on my TV's settings turn sharpness practically to max. But I couldn't even get anywhere near this good of a picture with composite. In fact, I'm going to gamestop right now and getting a used PS3 (since they're the same cords) component cable so I'll have this one as a spare. lol

I DEFINITELY recommend getting a component cable for PS2's on newer TV's, if not this one then another.",5.0
"Super Mario Brothers was one of my favorite games when it first came out. With New Super Mario Bros DS, you get the game fun gameplay - enhanced - in a nice portable system.

This isn't just a remake - it is sort of like how the Wizard of Oz starts out in black and white in a gritty, quiet town and then turns into multi-color, sparkling larger than life song-filled splendour. You get the NES versions of the game with similar - but not exactly the same - levels that have been updated from 2D to 3D. You get extra features like ground pounds, and mushrooms that make you SUPER large - you don't have to jump to break blocks any more, you can just walk and crash into them. Other mushrooms make you incredibly tiny, to reach places you could not before.

The combination of old style classic gameplay and updated graphic, sounds, and features is really quite good. These games were stellar in the first place, with their addictive levels that were just the right balance of challenging and fun. Add in the easy to carry with you DS gameplay, the new features and hidden things to look for, and I really found this just about perfect for an arcade game.

Yes, you could complain that you can zap through the game in a full day of gameplaying. However, this game series wasn't ever meant to be a ""month long role playing complex adventure"". It was always meant to be short, easily playable sessions that you could fit in while you waited for dinner to be ready. You could save and exit when you had to run to school, and then pick up again when you had time the next day without having to review 8 pages of storyline notes.

This makes the game PERFECT for carrying around in your DS. If you end up waiting in line for 20 minutes, you get through another section. If your bus gets stuck in traffic, that's another level you can get through.

Plus, there is replayability here, while you try to track down the hidden items and coins.

I enjoyed the minigames as well. Certainly you wouldn't buy this game FOR the minigames, but heck, if they're going to throw them in for free, you might as well enjoy them! I'm not usually one for DS multiplayer games, but it's nice that they did include that as well for those who want to play with a friend.

In general I was quite impressed with this, and recommend it heartily!",5.0
"Some people complain about the head phones feeling cheap. They're actually sturdy. The sound is amazing. I haven't tried the mic feature as of yet. I've used the headphones watching anime, playing Team Fortress 2, watching Netflix and playing other games on Steam. They've sounded great.

My only CON isn't unexpected. They're not noise cancelling meaning if someone is in the room with you and they're watching something you might hear their stuff unless you have sound coming through the headset. Also others will hear your gameplay or video if you turn it up too loud.

OVERALL, I'm happy with the purchase and recommend it to anyone on a budget but looking for a great gaming headset.

Sincerely,
Lee.",5.0

"the game-play on this GoW had a couple additions from the norm of GoW. these additons were mostly due to the gods that are defeated. however, the feel of the game remains the same: plenty enemies to kill, boss fights, the usual provocative scene with a female and plenty puzzles to solve. it is very enjoyable and educational(in terms of Greek mythology). As with all GoW's that i played, it was a work of art. i had numerous play-throughs.",5.0
"I have been a fan of the Ace combat series for ages. Unfortunatly many of them were pretty much the same game and very little new in them. That however is not the case with Shattered skies. The graphics are absolutly amazing, except for maybe the explosions which are a little dull when compared to the detail in the rest of the game. It is not too hard to learn. You have various difficulties to chose from and a large selection of aircrat and ordanence to buy. Gangs of fun. My only real complaint is that 18 missions is way too short. They could have easily done twice that many. The storyline that appears at the beginning of most missions is very interesting and can help pull you into the game. This game is alot of fun.",5.0

"This is a spectacular game. It is horrific, but it's not so much ""OH, my god! Im gonna die!"" scary, it's more like, ""If that was me, I don't know what I'd do!"" scary. It kinda gives you that chills. Resident Evil was slightly more ""BOOM!"" scary. It scared you right then and there with no expectations. But Silent Hill, the story unwravels. It's more like a mystery, which makes it so scary. It is a game of which you are able to veiw your character ""3rd Person"", but at your apartment, it is ""1st person"". When you begin the game, you wake up in your apartment and figure out that you were locked in and the clues that the ? has left in your apartment leads you to different worlds that test you skills. The first is the train station. It is very confusing, but try to cut through the two trains as quickly as possible. It is okay if you loose Cynthia, the girl you meet earlier, but you'll find her later. I can't tell you anymore, but the game has a great story, and you later figure out after the subway world that you are not dreaming, you were sucked into hell's reality after you visit at Silent Hill, and others have too (Cynthia). The game is nothing like Resident Evil, it is more scary and has the scariness of the first time you see ""The Grudge"" and the mysteriousness of ""SAW"". Spectacular game. It really should be put into a movie. I would reccomend this game for advanced players. It is tough, so get some of your Xbox knowledge stuffed in your brain, because your going to have to use it in ""Silent Hill 4: The Room"".",5.0
"I'm a huge fan of Tomb Raider, I loved the Anniversary title for the Wii. Beat that one twice just for fun. So, this game, for those who have played the other Tomb Raider game, this is a piece of cake. Sure some controls are a little different, like the ""-"" to grab things drop from ledges, etc. BUT you get the hang of it in no time. The swimming has improved dramatically, it is so easy to swim now and fast too. Just use the joystick for actual swimming and the wii remote arrows for direction. I haven't gotten that far in the game yet, but I love it. There's less fighting in this one from what I can tell, which is okay, I primarily love this game for the exploration aspect and figuring out where to go and what to do next. Exactly why I just returned the 007 game because it was too much shooting and no time for regrouping and exploration. I look forward to coming from work and playing this game. It's very entertaining and mellow! Two thumbs up.",5.0

"I have a new Xbox 360 game... ROCKSMITH! I've only been playing one week and it is fun and challenging!  I remember saying to myself years ago that Guitar Hero should have used a real guitar. Ubisoft delivers!!! I am getting back into guitar all over again from 20 years off, because my kids are interested. I have fallen in love all over again! This game is fun, challenging,  progressive (skill-wise), versatile, feature rich, made for guitar or bass and upgradable. It also acts as an amp, through the TV. That won't be a bonus for real guitarists, but it is for me. I don't play loud or demand much from guitar, YET. I bought an electric-acoustic due to its versatility and conditioning.

"A lot of people, such as myself, are buying this thing just for the dongle so that they can use their universal remotes with their PS3. There is a catch, though: Many are finding that their universal remotes are registering two button presses instead of one, at times. Those with some Harmony remotes can fix it within the remote itself, but for those of us with cheaper remotes it's almost a deal-breaker.

I can't speak for everyone, but with my $20&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philips-SRU5107-27-7-Device-Universal-Remote-Control/dp/B0026L7B8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philips SRU5107/27 7 Device Universal Remote Control</a>&nbsp;I had the same issue. Fortunately, I found a solution. I can't promise this will work for everybody, but if you own the same remote it certainly ought to.

The solution: Instead of holding down the buttons on the BluWave while using the universal remote's learning function, press and release them like you would during regular use. After a few presses, the universal remote should get the command and repeat it accurately to the infrared dongle. The only flaw in this setup is that I can't turn the PS3 on and off with my universal remote due to the BluWave not having that functionality. Otherwise, I'm perfectly happy with my purchase.",5.0
"This game exemplifies everything good about Nintendo.

Every level is designed with a passion that I haven't seen from a Mario game since Galaxy (the first one). Creatures fit their zones and the zones themselves fit their worlds. The boss fights are all cute and well designed. The music is exceptional and all the sensory responses the game elicits are perfect and wonderful.

This is a game I love to play. This is a game I love to watch people play. This is a game I love to think about playing. At the heart of it this is a genuine game. There is no cash shop harassing you. There isn't a bunch of DLC draining your wallet. It is a whole and complete experience that reminds you of the great things that can come from video gaming.

If this sort of development passion ever dies universally I will cease gaming entirely.",5.0

I find it pointless to write a review about a game with a 5 star rating already so I'll keep it short and sweet.  It seems there aren't as many RPGS being made anymore and is sometimes hard to find a good one.  Eternal Sonata was god awful imo.  Dragon age series were okay.  I really like Vasperia tho.  But my entire point to writing this review was to recommend you buy Arc Rise Fantasia for the wii.  Another diamond rated game similar to this one you're guaranteed to love.,5.0

"I have been a fan of the metal gear world since the NES days. That being said Snake Eater is a bit different compared to everything that came before it. It is also built with the very Japanese way of playing in mind, which means collection. You collect animals and plants to keep you fit and healthy, you collect camouflage patterns to help you hide. There is nothing wrong with this of course, it is just best to know before you buy that large portions of the game revolve around this.

The story is fantastic, its not as far fetched as MGS2, and it has a real gritty 70s feel to it, without being too over the top. Playing through for the story itself is worth ride. The enemies are classic MGS, but some of the best in the series. Some of the boss fights, the End for example, are pure genius. It really shows how you can push game design when so many people are just worried about graphics.

The game play can be frustrating at times, even on easy, until you find the right way to go about things. Every boss has some sort of weakness or strategy that works and once you find it you are generally fine. The weapons and equipment are great. They do very well in capturing the era and setting the game is trying to capture.

Metal Gear Solid 3 is pure MGS, without being a carbon copy of the previous installments. You will feel comfortable right of the start if you are a veteran of the series and even if new the learning curb isn't too steep.",5.0
"Muramasa: The Demon Blade is a side-scrolling action game with some RPG elements. You can play one of two characters, and each of them has a different story. As the game title indicates, the game is based on Japanese tales, and it has great elements of Japanese cultures and arts. One thing I like the most is, that there is no American voice dubbing in this game. I personally prefer the original Japanese voice acting for Japanese video games in general. Look at the Arc Rise Fantasia for example. If you had played this game before, you knew how bad the voice acting was. Anyway, this is very unique game. If you like side-scrolling actions, this will give you a unique experience.",5.0

"Great platform game with tons of collectibles, trophies, customization options, nice graphics and an entertaining and engaging story line. This one I got free on PSN when the company needed to recoup for lost network time.

Little Big Planet is a neat game that uses its star, Sack Boy, to run around collecting elements to customize himself, the world and his various costumes. Navigation and controls are quite easy to pick up, so you won't lose a lot of game time trying to figure it out. Land on little beasties to be rid of them and spend a lot of time jumping around, exploring each level. Stickers are well sought after. You can obtain them by completing levels, some challenges, and even playing player created levels. Use them to unlock items or decorate. You can even pretty up your own pod.

There is a BIG emphasis on player made content. Go to the community to see and experience levels made by other players. You can also play with friends, or other random online gamers. Get brave and produce your own creative play through. Publish it and watch how others rate you. They give feedback on difficulty, fun factor and anything else they may feel you should know.",5.0

"Incredible.  Immersive.  Replay value through the roof.  Storytelling excellence.  Voice acting that is professional and entertaining.  Hidden places.  Hidden stories.  Amazing weaponry.  A series of crafting systems that are actually FUN TO USE.

You can explore this world forever and be surprised by the hidden weapons, monsters, stories, etc.  You can start and maintain settlements.  Equip your settlers against raiders, mutants, ghouls, and monsters who attack these innocents quite often.  Explore the world with a synth, a super mutant, a dog, a robot, a drug addled warrior woman, etc.  Or go it alone.

The perks you unlock are unreal.  So much fun.  Every character you create to play through this game can be SO different.  You can play like a tank, a stealthy ninja, a thief, or a plain old lucky weirdo.  The possibilities are endless.

Combat is a pure joy.  Decapitate.  Sever limbs.  Disarm foes.  Pickpocket enemies and plant grenades in their bags.  The sound effects and visuals are perfect, gory, and sometimes very funny--in my opinion.

While the graphics are not incredibly upgraded from Fallout 3, they are very good and detailed.  The landscapes are horrific, beautiful, mysterious, etc.  Depending on where you are.  And the fast travel option makes this game a gigantic but manageable world.

The soundtrack is amazing.  Beautiful, sorrowful, thrilling--when appropriate.  The radio stations are hilarious and fun.  They bring new life an already vibrant post-apocalyptic world.

Life goes on in every area you visit, so be ready to encounter new enemies in areas you cleared.  And everyone in the game you can talk to is worth talking to.  You'll get jobs and clues and side quests from all kinds of people.

Fallout 4 is a HUGE game with a lot to do, but you are forced to do nothing.  Play as you will.

It's not perfect.  Companions get in the way.  Supply lines sometimes cause quest-giving settlers to be out and about, so you have to track them down.  Little things like that.  Otherwise, in my opinion. this game is as close to perfect as you can get.

If you love role playing, shooters, and resource management, Fallout 4 is your game.",5.0

"We have used three sets of gaming headphones with our PS4 so far and this is one of our favorite pairs. I think what I like best about them is that they aren't just for gaming. You can use them with any electronic device that supports a 3.5mm output w/ sound and microphone. I have also used them on my PC, my MAC with an adapter, and my iDevices. The sound quality is solid, and the optional sound cancelling mic is nice.

While these do REQUIRE 2 AAA batteries they seem to last quite some time (I haven't had to change them out yet) and give an added bass boost to sound along with the cool LED lights in the headphones themselves. Note, I didn't think you HAD to have the batteries when I first threw these on and they will not work without the.

One of the three of us who use these wears glasses and they don't crush his head so hard (unlike one of our other headphones) that he needs to remove them to avoid headaches. I also have a larger head size (XL on helmets for sports) and I don't feel like these have to stretch far and wide or tight to fit me. Very comfortable all around with the padded ear pieces (fake leather so easy to clean).

Overall of the three pairs we own, this one is now the sought after pair. If you have multiple gamers in the house, be prepared to buy more.",5.0
"Man, these reviewers are harsh!  Stop freaking whining about all the little items you wanted to import from the last game (which will easily be replaced with new and more powerful stuff), quit crying about how you want to go look for Morrigan, and freaking play.

If you do play, you'll find a great story, interesting new characters who are fun to use in combat, amazing battle situations, lots of new items, specializations, skills & abilities, and plenty of play time for your money.  The new enemy types are great--powerful and fast, the sub-quests are pretty cool, the loot is plentiful, and the art direction and creativity of the new environments, locations and such are, if anything, better than the original!

People are complaining about the length-- when most games cost $50-$60 and give you about 6-9 hours of play time, I don't know what the problem is here.  With the ability to create a new character from scratch adding even more replay value (in addition to playing through with any/all your characters from the first game) what the heck is there to complain about?

In short, go in with an open mind, and don't focus too much on a couple of character-importing details/glitches, and you will have a blast with this add-on.  I will say that having played this both with imported characters, and with a newly created one, it works MUCH better creating a new one.  The story makes much more sense, the process of equipping your character makes more sense (bringing in all that powerful stuff from your original game imbalances this one), the game is more challenging & balanced--things just click.

I sincerely hope they keep churning these out, I'm happy to pay for more time with one of the best video games ever made...spoiler--->> the only bad news is that the finale of the game really seems to put the nail in the coffin of this tale, bringing everything to a close and basically letting you know that your character's adventures, and the threats to Ferelden seem to be over.

"I'm a sports gamer at heart, but I like to play games from other genres as well (mainly RPGs or shooters).  I've been playing the Call of Duty/Battlefield/Timesplitters/etc. games for many years.  I can go all the way back to the days of Wolfenstein and Doom, but this isn't about where these games have been in the past, but where they've evolved to.  Battlefield 4 showcases a truly dynamic game that has constantly evolving gameplay with dynamic outcomes that never allow for the experience to grow dull and always give an organic experience.

The Frostbite 3 technology shines like never before with the Levolution tech (decent preview of it until next gen launches) when it comes to buildings being damaged to certain points.  This doesn't only happen with small buildings, but also with skyscrapers as well.  My time with the game has some to do with the campaign, which is solid so far, but I'm hooked with the online play.

Speaking of the online play, outside of the normal modes (Conquest, TDM, Rush and Conquest), you have ""Domination"" which is closed combat within an area and 3 points to hold, but there's so much variety in regards of what can happen in this mode (Sorry Call of Duty) that once again, the action never gets boring, dull or repetitive.  Normally, I'm the type that has to play the entire story/campaign mode before attempting any multiplayer games, but after I played once, I truly didn't want to stop playing.

In conclusion, Battlefield 4 is TRULY a next-gen shooter on current gen and it'll be scary to see what the next gen capabilities will bring forth for this game.  Call of Duty is a fun, pickup and play arcade shooter, but Battlefield 4 has truly set the tone for a quality real world shooter should include on a wide scale.  If you haven't already, definitely check out this title, you won't be disappointed.",5.0

"I have never been good at shooter games therefore never much cared for them. I think it is the first-person thing that I couldn't get used to. Fortunately for this game it is in third-person, so much easier, at least for me, to get a handle on it.

I decided to pick up a copy of this game when it went on sale after having tried the demo. Good Thing! It is an amazing gaming experience whether you decide to take the fight in the air or ground. The integration between them is really well done. I find it so rewarding when I am on foot and am able to shoot down a Warhawk.

The maps it offers are good. It could have used more maps, however the add-ons helps with that, and definitely recommend you get them.

I'm still not very good at it, and probably never will get any better, however this game is just fun!",5.0

"This is rather long.  So prepare!!!!

I had a Wii and a 360.  I never cared about the PS3.  Then I spent a lot of money at best buy and had some reward credit coming.  So, I decided to buy a PS3.  I sold half my movie collection and got blu ray before I even had the system.  I guess so I would have to buy it.  I got the system.  I was blown away by how great it is.  Below I will tell you why.

The system
The new PS3 is much smaller than the first.  It has two buttons on the front, as well as two USB ports.  I know some people complain about the fact that it has only two USB ports I can understand why.  I decided to get the move and was trying to charge up both of the controllers.  You need the Playstation Eye plugged in, so I only had 1 free USB.  But, while it is an in convince, I found no reason to complain.  I have a multi USB hub which makes the one USB port into 5.  So the problem is was to fix.  You can find a hub for about 35 dollars.  Some may say it is stupid to have to go buy it and not have it already available.  I guess they would be right.  But it is such an easy fix.  The system is very quiet.  I can not hear the system and I sit no more than 10 feet away when playing and watching movies on it.  It is rather long though.  It is about as wide as a standard DVD player.  It is rather heavy also.  Not to worry, I can't see people carrying it around.  I bring it to my grandfathers and that's it.  You can get a carrying case for it if you wish to carry it around places.  Also, I was watching a DVD that was about an hour and fifty minutes.  When I got up and took the DVD out, the system was not hot at all. It was a tad warmer in the back left, but nothing like I thought it would be.  That made me happy.  You need not worry about breaking the tray that comes out for games and movies because you just load your stuff like you do on the Wii.  You put it in front of the space in the front and it goes in.

The controls
I heard people complaining about the PS3 controller.  Now that I own a PS3, I can not understand why.  The controller is great.  It feels very comfortable in my hands.  I have medium hands.  I almost got teary when I started playing a game because it reminded me of all those times I spent playing my Playstation and Playstation 2.  Besides the fact that is feels and works great, there is also another cool feature within the controller.  There is a button in the middle that you can hit to do things like quit a game, turn on the system, turn off the system and a few other things.  I thought it was really nea

Games
The Playstation 3 has a lot of great games.  A lot of the games can be played on 360 as well.  But I will play them on here as well.  Just so I can get the points for doing things.  Also, there are a lot of great Playstation only games.  Like Metal Gear 4 and Uncharted.  I was wondering which system to add the games to my amazon wish list for and then I realized why not get them for both?  Now I can play great games twice!!!!  Actually, the games I downloaded look better than some of the games I have played.  It does not mean the games are not a lot of fun.  But I'm just saying.  I can not weait to try Modern Warfare 2 with the PS3 controller.  I also am excited about trying multiplayer games on the Playstation 3.  I have yet to play a game online.  So I look forward to giving it a try soon.

The in system features.
Ok, when I found out that I would search the internet with the system, I kind of had a freaky dance moment.  It works just like using a PC would.  I had no problem searching and watching videos from CNN.  I could search all the sites I did on my PC.  I can't wait to try Christmas shopping while sitting in my bed this year.  On top of the internet, you have things like music, videos, pictures and the Playstation store.  There are so many things you can do even if you buy the system but do not have the money to get a game at the same time.  I downloaded a game called Joe Danger and Planet Mini Golf and even now that I have Metal Gear, uncharted, sports champions and motorstorm, find myself playing more than the games.  They are very fun.  Good to know that there are some good games on the online aspect of the system.  That being said, I still don't know if I'm crazy about the store itself.  I like Xbox live and buying games from it.  Playstation has a lot of good stuff going for it.  Like when your looking for a game, on the right there are squares with a little picture of the game.  On the left you can see a little more about the game.  Then you choose an item and you can read more about it.  I also like the whole wallet thing.  When you have credit in the store it is put into a wallet.  I thought it was kind of cool.  Some things I didn't like were the fact that when you are downloading something, you can not leave the store.  You have to stay there and wait for it to download.  Oh and it takes FOREVER, for something to download.  I understand that the files are large.  But wow, I mean like 25 minutes for a game.  I have cable internet.  Playstation is the slowest thing I have when downloading.  Not sure why.  Then, sometimes when you go to play a game you will have to download an update.  I understand that you do that on Xbox as well.  But it has to do with the slow speed.  It just drags on and on.  But, I guess patience is a virtue.  You can also look at things yo have downloaded, any times you want.  You can redownload the items that you have already paid for free.  So, if you delete something for some reason or something is not working, you just go on your system and you get a list of everything you've gotten.  I thought that was great.

In the end
All and all I love the PS3.  It has so many things you can do and is only 299.99.  It's like buying a PC with a monitor the size of your TV that also has great games on blu ray and to download.  It also has net flix.  Also, the move is absolutely amazing.  I saw my Wii hitch hiking on the road a few days after I got the move and realized it was depressed.  I still love my wii.  But the Move is great.  Just hook the camera to the USB port and play away.  If your going to get the Move, I must say, get the one that comes with the camera, controller and game.",5.0
"Bought for our 15 yr old Son, said it was very challenging and entertaining, but lacked the graphics and realization references that other games have.  Not a total bust but certainly not his favorite game of the year....",5.0
"I've never played the Crash Bandicoot series, so this game was not familiar to me. But I'd heard a few good reviews of it (as opposed to the [later?]&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Nitro-Kart/dp/B00008XL0H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash Nitro Kart</a>), so I decided to give it a go and found it not to expensively (~$12) at a local used game store.

Tossed it into my friend's Wii that night and ended up playing it for like 4 hours straight. Yeah, it's that good... ^_^

This has quickly become one of my favorite games for the GameCube, next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mario-Kart-Double-Dash/dp/B00009WAUD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Melee/dp/B00005Q8M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros Melee</a>, in terms of general fun and overall replayability.

So, this game is actually several games in one. You actually don't start the ""normal"" game in a kart. You first start with a tutorial on how to play in the ""free roaming"" amusement park world as Crash Bandicoot. The story's contrived, but honestly, who cares? It brings together various characters from the Crash Bandicoot game world (I assume) for way too much fun.

The basic premise of the amusement park world is you can free roam around, break boxes to get coins and find various 'mission' items. Spinning while moving around seem to create a little suction in the vicinity to pull in nearby coins, making it easier to collect lots of coins quickly. You can also find and pick up shakes to double your coin intake when picking them up. Handy for amassing lots of coin quickly, to unlock things. So, you'll meet a bunch of characters from Bandicoot series. They'll all give you 'missions' to complete in order to unlock different vehicles for races. Some missions are relatively easy (bring 1000-2500 coins), others aren't too difficult (collect one or more power crystals, distributed around the different 'lands' of the amusement park, or collect specific parts or costume pieces for the characters).

In different parts of the free roaming lands you'll come across several mini games to play. Some of them are rather quirky. They include: skeet shooting animals launched across the screen (cows explode into steaks, chickens go up in a puff of feathers), skeet shooting parachuting monkeys carrying dynamite before they destroy things on the ground, bowling down some rather weird tracks (with holes, ramps & obstacles; you have a little bit of control over initial direction & throw power, as well as some control over direction once the ball is in motion), etc. A few of them are pretty maddening, especially when trying to claim the ""gold"" medal. I think they set the bar a bit too high on a couple of them.

And finally, we get to the titular ""tag team racing."" There is plenty of this to go around. You can unlock various tracks by finding the 'doors' to them scattered about the various themed 'lands' of the amusement park. Each land has about 3-4 tracks associated with it.

The big, titular feature of the racing is tag teaming or ""clashing"" in game parlance (it really should be called merging, as you don't fight against the kart you ""clash"" with, you instead merge with it and clash against other players on the track). The basic concept is that when you're next to an opponent kart, you press the Y button and a little animatic happens where the two karts merge. Once merged, you can access both characters' ""secret weapons"" for the purpose of devastating other opponents on the track. My personal favorite is Pasadena, who tosses out spinning lightning tops of doom. They bounce around the track and can impact other karts. Other secret weapons include a Gatling gun, a shotgun of sorts, some kind of glowing hockey pucks (I think?), etc. This game really does require learning the clashing mechanic, though it's not hard to pick up. When you clash, you start out as the gunner with the computer driving. It's handy, since the computer is USUALLY a pretty good driver and you don't have to concentrate on that. Instead you concentrate on either KO'ing drivers ahead of you to pass them or KO'ing the drivers behind you to stay in a leading position. It takes a little practice to figure out how to use each weapon and how to best aim / utilize it. Some are straight aiming, some require you to select a direction & a distance (near / far). Also, if you prefer to drive, you can tap the Z button to switch from gunning to driving. But I usually just stay as the gunner. If you happen to clash with a human player (mostly in the mutli-player mode from the main menu rather than in-game), I think it makes the driver / gunner selection based on who hit the Y button. Anyway, if you run out of ammo on one secret weapon, you can hit the B button to switch to the other character's secret weapon. Though, in a slightly annoying twist you can't continue aiming while the transition happens, which occasionally lets other players go by and wastes a few seconds re-aiming, making it harder to catch up.

In addition to the 'racing' there are various racing mini games as well (as distinct from the regular mini games). These include ""run and gun"" (you play as Crash's brother and use a Gatling gun to shoot as many targets on a single lap around the track as you can while the computer drives for you), ""rolling thunder"" (trying to KO as many opponents in a single lap as possible), ""fastest lap"" (basically trying to get the fastest time around the track), a ""stunt arena,"" ""battle arena"" and a couple others.

In case that all's not enough, it has mutli-player mode available from the main menu. You can either race, or engage in the battle arenas. Through playing and winning in multi-player, you get coins to use to unlock karts, outfits, levels & speed / difficulty levels for multi-player. Unlocking things in single player doesn't unlock things in multi-player, and vice versa, unfortunately. But neither mode is particularly difficult to unlock, once you get going.

Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the battle arenas in this game. Not as much fun as in Mario Kart games, in my opinion. Seems like the method of aiming & firing and KO'ing isn't quite as interesting as Mario Kart in terms of battle arenas. Basically, if the computer's driving it doesn't always drive in ways conducive to aiming at opponents. And you're limited in what you can do, since you're limited to the ""secret weapons"" of the characters, as opposed to the bevy of weapons Mario Kart uses.

Come to think of it, the game does also use boxes on race tracks similar to Mario Kart. You can pick up rocket boosters, and various things to throw (chickens, dynamite monkeys, pianos, cows, submarines; yep, submarines, don't ask me how)... But I don't think they include those boxes in the battle arenas? If not, it was a huge oversight, as it makes the battle arenas slightly less dynamic than Mario Kart, as mentioned above. That, combined with the AI controlled driving make the battle arenas oen of the lower points of the game. Feels like they could have somehow been made better.

I think that covers just about everything... Overall this game has a lot going for it. It's roaming, it's racing, it's mini games, it's battle arenas. It's fun and there's plenty to do!

Ohh, and it knows its audience (kids & teenagers), so on the loading screens, prepare for belches (A button) and farts (B button). The more players, the more annoying it gets. It's wonderful! Kids love it... (And some adults who are just big kids at heart. Or who want to amuse their youngsters with bodily noises.)

So, if you love Mario Kart, definitely give this bad boy a try. I'm pretty sure you'll have hours and hours of replayable fun. I wasn't expecting nearly as much as I got out of this. For the money, well it was worth every penny, probably twice over.",5.0

"I have been a Final Fantasy Fan ever since I played the first installment of this series on the Game Boy.  I have played just about every single RPG that has ever come out.  (excluding PS2, X-Box, and Nintendo Cube RPG's)  I have waited to write a review on this game for a specific reason.  I will not take Final Fantasy Games for granted.  I have read some reviews on-line, and then I bought the game.  I did this for some specific reasons, because you will here people giving reviews on both sides of the spectrum.  I have heard people give this game a negative 30 on a scale from 1-10.  And at the same time, I have witnessed people just blown away by this game.  Giving this game time to develope itself in the hearts of its buyer is the key to it's greatness.
  The day that I purchased FFIX, I noticed that Square gave it all they had.  If people are going to say that this game sucks, they are putting down the best RPG company in the world today.  Square purposly made this game the way it is.  I love it!!!  The main character is a thief, who has the mission to kidnapp a princess in order to ransom her off.  But in the process the princess wants to be kidnapped, and decides to leave with them.  During the game though, you will notice that there is not one main character.  For a good portion of the game, I felt that Zidane (the thief) was the main character, but then about five minutes later Vivi (the young balck mage)was.  This proccess went on constantly.  There is one problem with the game that can be overlooked.  Constantly you are asked to see what is happening at the same time you are doing your missions.  You will be waling around town, and then a message will pop up saying for you to press the select button for the real time effect.  You then will be shown a scene that is happening at that time.  So, with all of this going on, the first CD of this game seems to take forever.  Not only that, but just about every five minutes you will have a cinematic scene.  This is good and bad at the same time.  They are wonderful scenes, and put together very well, but at the same time you are not able to play the actual game.  But overall, it is worth the trouble, because your mind is put into a trance.  Your sucked into the story, and you don't want to leave.

"I was luck enough to reserve Vice City and pick it up the day it came out.  This game is one of the coolest games ever.  Just like  GTA3 you have complete freedom of movement.  There are over 120 cars to hijack and steal and there are also motorcycles.  I think the motorcycle is one of the best new features because it allows you to go at extremely high speed and you can easily weave in and out of traffic. Another cool feature is you can hijack helicopters.  Helicopters may not be the fastest thing to take but who cares.  Its pretty damn cool to fly 300ft off the ground dogging buildings and police helicopters.  There are many new weapons added to your arsenal like a machete, chain saw, MP5, Magnum and a chain gun.  Another great thing is you can walk into many buildings. Although some may not have much to offer, other buildings will have weapons money and many other things.  Although there are many things to do and see, the law is still on your back.  Police have gotten much tougher.  They can move in formation call for backup, or use a number of unarmed moves to throw you're butt to the pavement.  The only flaw is that the graphics still aren't top notch.  There better then GTA3 but they still could youse some help.  The main problem is there is still some clipping and you can loose your sense of reality( if there is any) if you see a body going through a wall.  Over all the graphics don't make a big difference, and you shouldn't let it stop you from buying this game.  This game is a must have, it will keep you entertained for months.  Make your life cool and thrilling buy this game.",5.0

"This is one of my favorite games of all time. It has a gripping story, fun dialog and solid game play. It came out 5 years ago as of this writing of this review so it is starting to show it's age compared to newer games but it is till fun. The ""Awakenings"" expansion adds a lot of new content and aside from an annoying ""rune crafting"" task it well thought out and written, and nicely sets the player up for Dragon Age 2. Some of the other add-ons like the Warden's Keep and Leliana's Song lack depth but do provide a little bit of back story for the characters involved that leads into the other games.",5.0

"Command and Conquer is a series that has a HUGE following amongst strategy gamers. Command and Conquer: Renegade is their entry into the first person shooter arena. The familiar sides of GDI and NOD are present, and all of your favorite weapons and vehicles are available for enjoyment.
The graphics are *really* nice, and shine in quite a number of areas. Well worth making sure you have a GEforce 3 or 4 for. Another great feature is that you can enter vehicles and even share them with friends. One person can jump into the driver's seat and the other can leap into the back to man the guns. There are APCs for transporting small teams.
The loading and recoil graphics on the weapons feel very realistic. You've got your weapons that you know and love from the various command and conquer games, including the laser rifle, chain gun, grenade launcher, flame thrower, chemical sprayer and more. A sniper rifle lets you zoom in on the action.
Sure, single player can be a bit boring. But as in most of these first person shooters, the internet multiplay is where the game really shines. Single player is really just a training arena until you 'graduate' to on line play. You can play with a team of 10 or more friends from around the world, working together as a group to coordinate your attack against the enemies. Just as in command and conquer, you have a base and have to defend it while destroying your enemy's base. You can blow up your enemy's bases by blasting them from the outside, or blowing them up from the inside!
With the HUGE number of HalfLife players out there, this is a giant step up in terms of graphics. The vehicles also make a great addition. It compares nicely with Halo, although Halo can't support large team play and isn't ""really"" internet enabled right now. If you find a fun group of players to team up with, you can easily get lost in the game for weeks, if not months!",5.0
"This was a really challenging game on ""normal"" dificulty. It can get a little repetitive against the same enemies before you get to the boss battles.  The enemies got harder as the game went on though.  The boss battles were really challenging.  You will probably need a new screen protector after you play this game, LoL.  You use the stylus mainly in this game.  I am glad I had a DSi XL for this game, because you had to hold the DS like a book for the gameplay.  The graphics were excellent to me.  The special powers, sound effects, and music were great.  I thought the story line was good for my taste.  They even had a nice little ending story while the credits were rolling.  This is the best game I have played on the DS so far.  Definitely a 5 star game in my book!",5.0

"My first Halo was the Halo 3, then ODST, and Reach. So it was a brand new experience to play this masterpiece on the 360. This is way too more challenging than the other 360 Halo games. It is a very tough campaign, but with great story telling. This is actualy the sequel for Halo Reach. Graphics are  beautiful, i switched a few times with the old look, and there is a huge difference,  but i played mostly on the new engine. The music soundtrack is amazing, like no other. Halo music is one of the best ever. One of the best campaigns you will ever play. And the Flood....uff..they will give you a run for your money. If you like FPS or a Halo fan, get it :)",5.0
"Not since the likes of the Myst computer series has a game captured a refined visual environment like that in BioShock 2. BioShock 2 defines itself as a unique light house in a sea of uniform games on two fronts. First it's distinctive storyline and plot absorbs the player with richly developed characters and in-depth goals. The developers use this in conjunction with an artistic landscape that forces a break in play to marvel and enjoy. The atmosphere is defined not by standard first person shooters but breaks the mold, in a clever and inventive departure from the norm. Second, although not subordinate to the latter, is BioShock's game play. Supported by a varied assortment of weapons and multiple add-ons, upgrades, and ammo types, there is scarcely a dull moment. The enemies are many and original, putting an end to the standard enemies found in most games of this type. This, coupled with an intensive goal oriented strategy and rich story line, will give players weeks of satisfaction. I regard this game as the cream of the crop when it comes to first person shooters. Definitely 5 out of 5, the vivid detail of the game and unique setting are only shadowed by the fun of it being played.",5.0

I absolutely love this game when I saw a walkthrough for it so I had to buy it. And honestly I'm glad I did. It's really good the combat system is easy to use and the storyline is very good as well.

"This game is a very simple hack and slash, with the controls amounting to movement and 3 buttons (attack, special, switch blade).  While it is ""simple"" it is NOT ""easy.""  It is very fast paced, enemies come flying, and your attacks are quick.  Don't expect a ton of rpg elements, there is a story, but this game shines when it comes to the action.  For what this game is, a simple+fun action 2-d hacker, I can only recommend it.  Awesome, get it!",5.0
"The Nintendo DS offers an excellent new pltform for gameplay by introducing the concept of dual screens, one of which is touch screen.

The controls are great, The hardware is light to where you can hold it with one hand.
Disappointments are the console doesn't come with a game, doesn't include an 'HMDI' cable for the best quality on a plasma & the two cards for a free membership on 'X-box Live' & a free movie download are long expired.

"I was really hesitant about buying this game especially since one particular reviewer say's the same thing about ALL the games which leads me to wonder how honest the review(s) are and based on that particular reviewer, and believing it I found myself quite unhappy with a couple of games I purchased and now stuck with them. So here is the real deal for House of 1000 Doors.  IT RULES!!!!  I needed the hint button a few times and only checked the strategy guide twice (it's included and doesn't interrupt the game as in other games). The graphics are so poignant and vibrant it is not too difficult to remember where to return to after finding an object to move to the next level or complete the level you are in (and my memory sucks!!).  I have some pretty awesome games, but this one takes the cake! A must have if you are into seances, ghosts, mediums....  Only problem I had was trying to figure out some of the puzzles. Instructions given on the bottom of the screen (i.e., turn coins so they are same color and they wouldn't turn and the man on the gandola where you have to move the arms to replicate the image of the picture by clicking on forearms and shoulders and they wouldn't move.)  Other than that great game!!!!",5.0
"It seems like I've had this game on my wish list forever, but didn't get it until now because of the poor reviews.  If you're a fan of sci-fi futuristic FPS games, then you can't go wrong with this game at the price it's selling at.  I paid $10 and this is probably the best bang for the buck I've ever seen.  And yet it gets less than three stars (at least before I added mine).

The first thing you'll notice is that it has remarkably good graphics, even by today's standards.  It may not be like Crysis, but it's still competitive with much of what's out there today.

Overall, this game is very typical of the genre of games that fall into the same category as HalfLife 2.  Not quite as sophisticated, but it still has some surprising effects, fairly good weapons, creative monsters, and nicely rendered scenery.

Before I started playing, I installed one patch (1.2 I think) and I had zero technical problems with the game.  There was one instance where the team members couldn't manage to get through a doorway which they had to go through to continue the game.  I restarted from the very recent checkpoint and the problem was gone.  No other issues at all.  The game ran smoothly with everything set to max on my 3GHz Core 2 duo, 4 GB RAM, and dual SLI-linked 8800GTS 512 GPUs.  I'm running Vista x64.  It has a long list of screen resolutions and aspect ratios, so it will probably adapt to whatever your graphics capabilities are.

It doesn't have user invoked saves.  It saves at ""checkpoints"" which happen frequently enough that you won't find yourself playing for 20 minutes just to get killed and have to start over again.  I played on the middle difficulty setting which is called ""HARD"".  I found it a little easy at that level, so you may want to give the highest difficulty a try.  You can change the difficulty level whenever you load up the game, so if you want to change part way through, it's no problem.

Weapons are typical: pistol, assault rifle, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, plus a futuristic scatter gun and plasma rifle.  Ammo abounds, so you're not likely to run out very often.  There are also turrets on the ground, on Humvees, and in the helicopters that you can use.

Health regenerates by itself, but when the screen gets red, you need to duck under cover and recover from your wounds, which happens fairly quickly.

You drive a Humvee during parts of the game and, unlike most games, it steers using the mouse rather than the keyboard.  I found that much easier to control and it was almost like driving a sports car (except it really didn't go that fast).  I rarely enjoy vehicle driving sequences as much as I did in this game.  You need to maneuver the Humvee through rough terrain and wreckage to get past some of the monsters which added considerable excitement.

You have a team of a couple guys (actually one is a girl) that you can command to move ahead or target specific bad guys.  Like many games, the team members don't really do much to kill bad guys, because that's what you're playing the game to do.  You don't want them steeling your fun, do you?  How well the team performs is based on morale which changes depending on how well you're doing.  With high morale, they are supposedly more effective.  The morale level flashes on the screen and is apparently enhanced when you give the team targeting directions.

The story line is typical.  I don't pay a lot of attention to story lines, so I don't find them critical to game enjoyment.  Throughout the game, you come upon ""dossiers"" that you can collect.  I missed several and never even looked at most of them, but they most likely enhance the story line a bit.

The game was probably about average length.  It didn't take me as long as Fallout 3 or STALKER, but it seemed longer than the two Crysis games.  Yes, it's linear, but I consider that just the style of game it is and don't count linearity as a negative.  In fact, I prefer it to the open field games like STALKER.

My rating of five stars is based on the quality of the game for the extremely low price.  I would still rate it at four stars even if it were pricier, though.  I highly recommend this game for people who like traditional futuristic shooters.  It's enjoyable, easy to learn, and frustration free.",5.0

"Ds is gonna be the bomb. I heard it has a built in Picto-chat. It comes with a battery. It also comes with a AC apapter. You can recharge the battery and the DS.

If you get this for Christmas it will be the best Christmas for you ever. I also reccomend the Starter pack as well. It is a great value. saw the cases and they are cool. It came just in time for Christmas. DS is nothing like anything else. Nintendo DS is like a lot of games based on the N64 games and it is like a portable Gamecube because it has the graphics like Gamecube, it is not the same AT ALL. I ask u a question has there ever been a PORTABLE game constle with 2 screens and 1 of them a touch screen? I think not. also i don't think many people thought of something portable and with 2 screens and 1 a touch. DS is like nothing you have ever seen or thought of before. So get DS",5.0
"Great game! I'm a huge fan of the Aliens comic books (and films of course) and this game is just like playing a comic book! I've had it since March 2013 and still play it. I wanted a shooter with zenos though so I love it. The lurkers are my Zeno on here.

Gearbox had to remake the game to play on home consoles and pc. This game only got bad press  because whoever greenlit the demos didn't put any restrictions on the graphics etc. Yeah it might have been made in 9 months but I love it! Check out Alien isolation too!",5.0
No problems.  Exactly as described.,5.0
"I absolutely LOVE this game, and I'm not even a big Pokemon fan - I used to be when I was younger, but since I'm a big fan of the Tekken series, this game certainly lands in a sweet spot.

In all honesty, I had no intention of getting this game, even after all the positive reviews kept flooding in, but my son and I were at the store the day after its release, and he seemed enthusiastic about so I bought it for him. In the 2 weeks that we've had the game, we've probably played it at least 10-15 hours, and we've enjoyed every minute of it.

The graphics are fantastic. You can tell there was a lot of care and consideration put into the development of this game. It is very disappointing to hear that there are no current plans to expand the roster, and many of the levels are variations of another, but overall, I am VERY pleased with this game. The combat is an absolute blast. I am a very seasoned video game player, but my 5 year old has a chance of beating me in any given round, so it makes it fun for both of us, and he doesn't get discouraged by having the feeling that he doesn't have a chance of winning.

Leveling up your character isn't a chore - the tournaments are engaging and exciting, and in the later leagues, the level of difficulty really does get tough. I started out 39-0, but once I started moving up in the rankings, I quickly found myself coming back down to earth only winning about 70-80% of my battles.

In short, this game is an absolute blast and I am so happy I bought it. I have my fingers crossed for an expanded character roster in the future, but for now, the development team did a really nice job of making each character unique with a huge list of moves.",5.0
"One of THE MOST OVERLOOKED GAMES! I love this game! I only bought it after sooo many people and magazine reviewers said how great it was. It was also a total bargain so what the heck. This game is great if you want to escape into a futuristic fantasy world and do exploring, fighting, sneaking, and solving puzzles. I am half way through it and love it. It is not a mainstream game and has one of the more well thought out stories in video games. If you liked games like Dues Ex, Zelda, and other adventure conspiracy games then give this a try!",5.0

"A Game Informer Editor not all that long ago reviewed this game as part of their past reviews section. He said it was his favorite game of all time. When EGM magazine made their list of top 100 games of all time, this game was higher on their list than any other game by Sonic Team. I love this game, and would not part with my copy for anything. Why? SO glad you asked.
First of all, this game has some the prettiest graphics to be found anywhere. No, not the smoothest, not the highest polygon count, not the most astonishingly technically ect, ect. This game may be old, but the graphics have STYLE, they flow, and they are FAST.
Secondly, the music of this game is some of the coolest ever produced for a video game. From the neat intro to the music played after you defeat a boss or a level, the music in Nights is pure magic (except perhaps for the terrible end game music). And not only that, the music changes in the levels depending on how you interact with Nitopians and how well you do.
But of course the real thing that makes any game great is GAMEPLAY, and this is the area where Nights is mind-blowing. Every level is a 3d on tracks wild ride, morphing, spinning, zooming, and zipping. Through these levels you are constantly trying to at a brisk pace in order to keep from running out of time. And you are trying to rack of bonus points. And then, you reach the only part of the level and wonder...should I go around again for more points, or should I play it safe and exit the level now? You'll only get good points if you exit BEFORE time's up AND get tons of bonus points. And then there's the bosses. They may be pretty easy to beat, but you're timed. Beat them faster to rack up more points. Beat them slow to, well...lose points. It all becomes quite addictive, quite quickly. And controlling Nights is breeze with the Saturn 3d analog controller (I Do NOT recommend using the standard saturn controller for this game. It's not nearly as intuitive and just takes too much away from the experience.)
About the only major negative point that can be made in reguard to this game is that it's too short. If it had double the amount of levels it would be perfect. But even at it's tragicly short length, Nights is an undisputed classic. Every level has replay value galore, thanks to the grading system, and the previously mentioned interactive soundtrack. And even when you've long since beaten the game and played it to death, you'll find yourself picking it up once in while for one more try at breaking your highest score. All in all, it's worth buying a SEGA Saturn for this game alone.",5.0

Long story short, Fire Emblem: Awakening is every SRPG fan's dream. Create your character, team up with a compelling and funny cast of other characters and set off on a grand adventure. Add in cool gimmicks like being able to pair up your characters to support each other in battle (and, depending on the match-up, get married and have children) and a slow-to-start but epic story and you've got one of the 3DS's best offerings... period.

"Gaming mice, they are an invaluable part of any PC gamers setup, often the quality of the mouse can spell life or death for the gamer. Often times PC gamers have to shell out an arm and a leg to get the best quality mouse out there. Everything has to be perfect, the DPI, the weight, the way the mouse is set up when you hold it, how many programmable buttons there are and most importantly, it has to feel right in the hands. Many times, the combinations of all of these things can bring hefty a price tag. Sentey is here to change all of that; as it brings a quality feel, programmable buttons, and changeable DPI settings all for under $20. This may sound too good to be true, but to me, Sentey has hit the sweet spot when it comes to affordability and quality.

As many of my readers probably know already, Im primarily a console gamer. I have played on just about every console since 1993 but admittedly have never played on a computer until very recently. The mouse and keyboard setup always felt a bit daunting and maybe a little intimidating for a guy that has never used either of these things for heavy duty gaming. Whenever I bought my Alienware Alpha I decided from then on I will give mouse and keyboard a shot. Heck, it couldn't be too hard right? I was wrong, dead wrong. When I first started playing multiplayer I was getting picked apart by these PC veterans that had much more capable hardware than my old Logitech mini mouse and wireless keyboard. I decided enough was enough and started shopping around for my first gaming mouse and keyboard. I decided on the Black Web keyboard (which will be reviewed in a few days) and the Sentey Nebulus gaming mouse.

I couldn't believe the price I paid, at $18 and shipping I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't think it was going to be the best money can buy, but I just wanted something that could work a bit better than my old mini mouse. When it arrived at my door I was surprised by how well packaged it was. It felt every bit as if I paid much more money, especially how it was presented when the box is opened. The packaging was in great detail and I was surprised how well-made everything felt considering the price I paid. I then began to open the package, taking not of any imperfections on the mouse itself along with the accessories, there was a slight scratch on the top right, upon further inspection I noticed it was a smudge and I got it out with a damp cloth. I then moved over to the accessories, nothing really comes with it that would wow the usual gamer, but there are a few things that shouldnt be overlooked. Surprisingly, the Nebulus is weighted so there are weights you can put into the mouse to make it heavier or lighter depending on the gamer in question. Personally, I liked all the weights in as it gave more of a premium feel. I couldn't for the life of me, however, get the little box it comes with open to put the weights in if I didn't need them. There are at least 10 little tabs you need to pry open with a butter knife or something similar, and even then it isn't easy. I was a bit disappointed in that, but overall the Nebulus felt great so far.

Upon plugging it into my computer, I saw that the Nubulus comes with a mini DVD that I was supposed to install with my mouse. I decided against it and found the software here instead. It was a painless install as the mouses drivers vary light weight. To my surprise, the mouse is also usable on my Chromebook as well. Something I was not expecting at this price point. Once the Sentey software was installed I was off and programming my mouse with ease. The Nebulus software is a lightweight program that really adds to the advantages of the mouse. You can change just about everything about the mouse with a few clicks. Want the blue lights on the side off? You can, want them to breathe? Why not. It is all there and easily accessible whenever you need them.

I was almost jumping out of my seat with excitement as I loaded up Counter Strike Global Offensive as I have had nothing but bad luck with it since I started. I almost never seemed to have a chance with these pros that have been playing for 5 years while I the noob, have played the game fewer than 2 weeks. I still got demolished, but I found that it wasn't quite as much. I then decided to move to a BOTs game and really get the feel for the new mouse. I noticed right away that the mouse glided smoothly no matter the surface. Now, that doesnt mean you can use a shag carpet as your mouse pad anytime soon, but you shouldnt have any trouble using the nebulous no matter what type of mouse pad you use.

Along with the normal mouse buttons one has come to expect with a mouse, (left and right button along with a clickable scroll wheel) there are two programmable buttons on the left side of the mouse, and in the middle, there is a DPI or CPI button which is written on mine which changes the setting from 400 CPI all the way up to 3200 CPI. When the light is off, the mouse moves at a snails pace. I don't see many gamers using this mode as it is just plain slow. Once clicked again, a red light glows and the mouse moves a little faster, but not too fast where it is uncontrollable. Once pressed again, an orange light glows from the top of the mouse, this is the second highest setting and feels abut right. It is fast but also not too fast. I find it the most comfortable for FPS gamers. The green light or the fastest setting is considerably faster than the rest and I am starting to get a feel for it over time. it is super fast, but games where reflexes are key there is no setting that feels better than the highest setting. When playing at night, be careful! The blue light sensor at the bottom of the mouse can almost be used as a flashlight. This can be distracting when you are a gamer that picks up the mouse frequently to re-center the mouse after a gun fight (Im one of them). On the sides you will notices a little bit of cheaper plastic that isn't quite up to par with the rest of the mouse, when your gaming however it feels a bit better and grips bit better to your ring and pinky finger while gaming. At first, I was disappointed with this plastic, but I am growing to love it.

Overall, the Sentey Nebulus is a very high quality mouse for an amazing price, the tangle-free usb cord is long enough at about 1.5m, the hassle-free setup and the overall quality of the Nebulus cannot be beat in this price range. I did notice a bit of cheap plastic, the case for the weights is almost impossible to open and the blue sensor at the bottom can be blinding. However, the excellent feel for larger hands like mine is awesome as some mice feel a bit tiny in the hands and are prone to sliding under the hands, especially when playing an FPS. Fortunately, the Nebulus has a soft touch, rubber feel to the top and is big enough for people of all sizes to play comfortably. There are much better gaming mice out there, but they also come with much larger price tags. Personally, the Sentey Nebulus is everything a PC gamer needs for a price cheaper than many gaming mouse pads out there, if you are in the market for a gaming mouse you will be hard pressed to find a better gaming mouse for under $20.",5.0
"Lost Odyssey is an amazing game, and a throwback to traditional JRPGs in the vein of Final Fantasy. The game's characterizations are fantastic, and its premise lends itself well as a new take on the amnesiac hero. The story of Lost Odyssey is deeply affecting; it is both full of action and laced with soft, tender moments. These moments come from the interactions of characters with one another, as well as when certain events unlock memories told through poetic short stories that are accompanied by music and dreamscape-like pictures. The action comes from random encounters and boss fights, which require strategy, forethought, and skill. All of these elements meld together really well, and create a wondrous story-driven adventure. As long as you don't come in expecting a rpg like Mass Effect or Fallout 3 (both great, of course : ), and are prepared for an often slow, but always rewarding tale,you will most likely enjoy this game.",5.0
"I have played this game on the SNES several times.  This summer I was at a cabin that had a SNES and Super Mario World.

"This is a great pedal set for the price, definitely recommend cause for $100 these simply can't be beat. However they are a few slight cons to them which I have listed below but I still give these a 5 star rating cause the cons have either never been done in another pedal set or something that may not be a con to someone else.

-No force feedback, heard Turn 10 state in a interview that they could program for force feedback pedals so that you could feel the rumble of the cars chassis so I'd very much like to see this happen eventually.
-The Chronicle brake mod is a great cheap and simple alternative too these pedals that allow users too adjust how much progressive tension they feel, sorta. The only downfall is the more progressive tension you won't (basically the closer the rubber piece gets to the back of the pedal) the shorter the distance is so ideally it would've been nice to have that great progressive tension, with the same adjust-ability of course, but also have that same distance of travel.
-Would be nice to see some more metal pieces for the exterior, or least the piece that the pedal plates are mounted on.",5.0

"This review is both for the X-BOX as well as the PC-version of the game:

You got a weekend coming up? You got some time on your hands? You got a grand supply of Coke and pizza? You got a craving for good horror movies and games? You know how to turn off the lights and turn on your computer/X-BOX? And finally: you got a computer that can actually run this game fast enough (no need to worry here if you have an X-BOX)? Well, then what are you waiting for: get DOOM 3 to have the greatest thrill and chill ride of your life!

Doom 3 is something like TOTAL RECALL (remember Arnold, the Governator, back in his glory days on his mission to Mars?) meets DOOM meets HALF-LIFE meets SYSTEM SHOCK 2.

From the get-go this game simply grips you with its eerie dark atmosphere. And this is the plot: You are a space-marine who just got assigned to a top secret research facility on Mars - very much like an Area 51 in outer space. As soon as you leave the ship and enter the hangar you'll be exploring the base. This part of the game works very much like Half-Life. In a creepy ""calm before the storm""-fashion you get to navigate the dark corridors, offices, underground machinery and even the cantina and restrooms. Even though you can't exactly tell what's wrong -  you get the feeling that something badly out of whack. Some people (you may choose to talk to) seem to be on the edge. A TV blurs about recent happenings. Data-units and screens give you access to information about Mars, the base, the staff etc. You may even listen in to conversations when you're passing by some people. The level of interactivity is amazing and the claustrophobic spooky tone won't let you go until the very end of this game. There's lots of scripted events as well, which are all well done and do not interrupt the flow and overall experience, at all.

Soon you're given a PDA (That's ""Geek"" for: Personal Data Assistant), which allows you to collect access codes for doors depending on you clearance level. Even better: you'll come across data discs other workers, guards, scientists or military personnel have left behind and you may use your PDA to listen in to their recordings. It's just plain spooky walking through almost abandoned underground facilities and finding old recordings, in which workers, who were recently here complain about events they cannot explain.

Finally you will get to share experience. And you'll get more of a fair share of problems! First it's just something small like the lights going out in a gloomy stairwell leaving you in utter darkness. Later on, inexplicable things happen around you and before you know it all hell breaks loose. Soldiers turn to Zombies. Creatures from different dimensions walk the deserted hallways of the base. Out of a sudden the darkness around you is not just oppressive but may hide devilish things around every corner. This is where the true action starts.

This is where the game does turn into Doom. But don't expect hordes of enemies in well- lit surroundings that can easily be defeated! The game remains dark and sinister and it will keep you going just because you'll want to see what creepy areas lie ahead and what nightmarish creatures you'll encounter next. Surprisingly Doom 3 remains tense and suspenseful thanks to a real storyline, which has been implemented quite well through the above mentioned PDA's as well as plenty of information you'll witness on various video-screens inside the bowels of the huge Martian base. In time you'll understand why these inexplicable things are happening and - how to stop them.

The graphics are top notch. IF your PC can deal with them. If you do not have the very latest technology on hand you'll be forced to turn down details - and lose a lot of the best FX that make Doom3 so great. The best thing besides the ultra-realistic object-, character-lighting and bump-mapping is the real-time rendering of shadows. If a light bulb swings around inside an old staircase, you'll see shadows of every railing, grating and other object moving across the floors and walls! Freaky! Fortunately you have a flash-light that will soon become your best friend. Unfortunately you won't be able to use it while you have another weapon equipped, but switching is easy - on the whole it makes the already creepy action even more intense. Fortunately all of these features were carried over to the X-BOX! Even though PC-fans may argue that a TV screen simply cannot deliver the resolution of a monitor, think again once you've seen Doom3 on X-BOX on a state of the art wide-screen and dolby surround system! It rocks! It's amazing that the X-BOX can handle the game so very well. Unless you have a state of the art PC you may even want to consider buying an X-BOX just to run this game - it sure is gonna be cheaper than upgrading your PC with a new graphics card!  :-)

The sounds are very well chosen and placed. From the humming of machines in dark basements to water dripping into deep shafts to the noise of the wind outside the base  and the far-away whistling of ghostly tunes around the starting area of the base - it creates a vision of terrible things around and afoot.

The level design is outstanding! You'll get to appreciate the eerie feeling that something may be lurking around every corner and that whatever is waiting for you there - you can run but you cannot hide in the stuffy claustrophobia-inducing hallways, chambers and ducts. You're gonna explore different parts of the base with plenty of different themes such as: barracks, labs, factory, hangar, reactor etc. but you'll also get to explore the outside of Mars' surface as well as a space station, a hell-like alternate dimension and an underground Martian facility, buried under the surface of the planet for millennia!

The weapons are fairly standard, but they are all a lot of fun to use! From pistols to shotgun, to automatic weapon, plasma gun and rocket-launcher everything is covered. Of course, you'll get a new version of the BFG 1000, too! Last but not least there's a weapon called a soul cube, which is an alien weapon that leeches health from an enemy and uses it to replenish yours. And, boy, does it come in handy later on in the game!

Make sure you PC is up to date - and that your X-BOX power-cord is plugged in  :-)

and have the spookiest 15-20 hours of gaming history.

"I am not sure why but this game out of all the others I have played in 3D and all the movies I have watched. Jak gave me the 3D sickness for some reason I think its to do with the 3D render or something. Although, the time I spent in 3d was really well done, some stuff layered and some stuff popping out. The games overall are very good and can add 3 easy platinum to your trophy collection.",5.0

"You played the hero. You played the villain. Now, you play the Barney. Okay, it may not be as long or intense as the original Half-Life, but you have to give ""Blue Shifts"" marks in many other areas. The new graphic and weapon designs are amazing, greatly improving the playing experience. The price is worth it simply for the updated graphics, since going back through Half-Life and Opposing Force with the new graphics is like playing a completely different game. For those of you who hated the Xen levels in Half-Life, you'll be happy to know that only one level in Blue Shift sports you on the alien world. In my opinion, the Xen level in Blue Shift is the best in the entire series, so even you avid Xen haters might find yourselves gaping at one or two turns along the road. I also approve of how the programmers added a different character from the other scientists and barneys you meet along the journey in the character of Dr. Rosenberg. If anything was missing from the original Half-Life it would have been a main character other than Freeman and the G-man. Blue Shift fills this void excellently. You really feel like you have scientists around you who can actually help instead of hinder your progress, something you never felt in either Op Force or Half-Life. Of course, in Blue Shift you get to explore all new areas of the incredibly huge Black Mesa Research Facility. Perhaps the most interesting locales you see are during your tram ride into work: a dry cleaners with a Barney and scientist playing a street fighter like game; a futuristic food court with pizza and ham burger restaurants; a really cool looking science lab with glass floors and computers galore, among many other things. At the end you also get to see one of the very first teleportation machines the scientists at Black Mesa invented. Remember the machine Gordon Freeman used in Half-Life? It's similar, only older looking and a bit smaller.
Now, as you might imagine, there are some set backs to the game. My number one gripe was the length. If you thought Op Force was short, it'll seem three times as long after playing Blue Shift. In spite of the shortness, however, the game has no boring or repetitive levels which means the replay value is quite high. Another grip is Gordon Freeman. You only get to see him for a quick second at the beginning and end of the game! It would have been a smart move on Vavle's part to add Gordon a little more to your plight. In spite of the setbacks, though, the positives vastly outweigh the negatives. It was very fun coming back to the Half-Life universe again, playing a timid security guard who is caught in right in the middle of the ""incident"" at Black Mesa. I look forward to Half Life 2, whatever that might bring!",5.0
"The GBA is the best hand held system there is, in my opinion, because it...has the ability of a PSOne (even if the length of the games are alittle shorter) and it is completely backwards compatable. It'll play the games of GB, GB Pocket, GB Color, and the GB Advance games of course. So...if you have old games you want to play, you don't have to use an old system, this one still works. The con I can think of is..no back lighting. But the GBA SP has front lighting, so that's being solve I guess. But if this is all you can afford, I'd grab it becuase it's good for on the go gaming.",5.0

"Let's get one thing straight- I typically despise RPG's. But this game was different. I...I enjoyed it. For the first time, I began to respect RPG's.

Here's Why:

On the + side:

1. Awesome graphics

Simply Breathtaking. My only problem is, night doesn't seem that dark.

2. Fun and varied gameplay

There's so much to do! Go on a quest, go fishing, or even turn evil as you run through a town, killing everything in sight.

3. Great sound

Both the effects and the music are good in this game.

On the - side:

1.  The controls

While they felt okay for this game, they felt a little clunky.

2.  The story

Even though the developer promised a varied story, it ends up being the same for every game.

Overall, this is a great game and definitely worth the money you pay for it!",5.0
"It is as good as the commercials imply the next ""big thing

to hit console system is not an ape"". LOL

This game is pretty awesome, just like ""Enter the Matrix""

it never gets too boring and thus live up to expectations

for the most part. Ok there are some drawbacks but

really the graphics, controls and cool Matrix moves you

can pull out along with playing Neo for the first time

are all bonuses!!!!

That was the major complaint two years from Matrix

fans, now Neo is the main character.

Let's see how the games builds up shall we folks:

Graphics:

The graphics were quite excellent if I must say

so, I really don't know what geeks complain about

saying it sucks. The characters look just like they

did in the Matrix including Neo. The movie looks

spectacular in full color. On a big screen tv ,

thr graphics rule. Lots of detail everywhere showing

the Matrix Very nice.

Sound

Yep great here as well,  the actors from the movie do

provide some of their voices, the game itself uses

clips and audio for the movie so you really feel like

you're in the movie!!!!!  How cool is that. That has

to be very cool.

Controls

The controls ok we're perhaps the weakest part to some

gamers, but I thought they were good. You have a whole

can of buttkicking matrix combos to do here. The most

powerful ones will keep you alive especially when

you meet up with the Agent Smith and others.

Extras

Ok some ok extras following the game including a Making

of extra.

Challenge

The challenge is pretty cool. It is subpar but

only because I consider myself a veteran gamer with decades

of experience here. Most vets will pass the game within

a week or two. However, that doesn't take away too much

from the pleasure here. The game is pretty challenging

when it needs to be. The battles with the Agents have

to be the highlight. There are some spectacular battles

that make this game buying or rent.

I would recommend this game to any fan of the movie,

or Matrix universe. You will not be disappointed and

it would make a great Christmas gift.",5.0

"The Corsair Gaming M65 Pro RGB Mouse is a well built and thought out device that delivers quality and precision.  I was very impressed by the quality and feel of the mouse.  It felt solid in the hand and the button layout (and button response) is excellent. The scroll wheel is very smooth, as well.

I cannot explain enough how awesome the mouse feels in the hand.  The weight is just right and it has a great conforming feel to the hand.  It doesn't get uncomfortable with long use.  The customizations were on par with most gaming mice, although I'm not as crazy about the software.  But it certainly does what you need it to.

Overall, the Corsair M65 Pro is a well crafted gaming mouse and worth giving a try.",5.0

"First, I'm not a fan of JRPGs (too cliche and annoying to me). I didn't buy this game for the story.

I was looking through ""the bargain bin"" at my local gamestop and saw this being sold for less than $15. I thought, doesn't look all that good. A few days later, I was bored and decided to look up some reviews on this game. I'm glad I did. Screenshots don't do the game justice! The action is absolutely chaotic, with missiles flying every which way and huge star ships providing heavy firepower amidst hundreds of smaller fighter ships dog-fighting. It's really a visually stunning game.

The story-line could be better; it's your typical macross/gundam-esque star-fighter cliche, but that's not the point. Project Sylpheed is just plain FUN, which can't be said about most games these days.

Don't overlook this gem like I almost did, it's worth your time and definitely worth your money.",5.0

"So far it looks like Microsoft has done a very good job with XBox Live. The starter kit gets you a disc that updates your XBox with Live capability and includes a couple of demo games. Frankly, the demo games aren't very exciting. I recommend picking up a new game (such as Unreal Championship or Mech Assault) when you purchase the starter kit. The kit also includes a headset for talking with other players (more on this later). Finally, your [money] gets you all this and a one year subscription to the service. After this, there is a monthly fee. Conveniently (ok, very annoyingly), when you go through the setup process, you enter your credt card information and accept an agreement that will auto-bill your credit card once the initial year passes. I would have preferred to have the option to automatically terminate the service, but why give the consumer what they might want? :)
Once you get setup, fire up your favorite XBox Live enabled game and enjoy a relatively lag-free online gaming experience. I've primarily played Unreal Championship and have had no major lag issues and always had a great time playing. Talking to other players really adds a new dimension to gaming. People aren't too chatty just yet, but I've had generally good experiences talking to other gamers online. Interestingly, even though you can opt to mask your voice, most people don't.
One final note.  The XBox Live site doesn't advise using a wireless network (technically, they aren't supported).  I've been using a wireless network exclusively and have had no problems, even while running Unreal servers hosting 5 or 6 players.
So, if you want to take your XBox gaming to the next level, sign up for broadband service, grab the starter kit and enjoy!",5.0

This is a genre i'm not used to, but I definitely love seeing how a single choice can either save you or wreck your life. The butterfly affect is nicely presented and I love the emotions poured into the characters. I'm still new to it so i'll continue to update as I progress.",5.0
"The 2DS is essentially a non-folding 3DS without the 3D effect. I picked up one on a whim yesterday, and I have to say I like it. I've never owned a DS, much less a 3DS, so I'll probably end up reviewing some of the features it shares with other DS systems, too.

For starters, the thing is a lot smaller than I thought it would be. All of the images you see online make the 2DS look HUGE, but this isn't the case. The 2DS fits right into my (admittedly large) hands. Your mileage may vary, but I think it's just the right size.

One small concern is that it doesn't fold. Those two screens are exposed at all times... never a good thing! There's a case available for the system, and given that the 2DS doesn't fold, it's probably a worthy investment.

To navigate through menus on the 2DS, you use a little pen-like pointer that's called a sytlus. Prior to owning this system, I'd never used such a device, but the whole thing works pretty well. When typing words, the stylus is considerably faster than putting your fingers on the touchscreen.

Here's something cool: You don't really even need to buy a game when you get the thing. There are lots of 3DS demos you can download to make more informed purchases. Also, you can download GameBoy and Game Gear games for nominal fees. That's pretty cool.

Regarding the lack of 3D, I don't feel like I have enough experience with the 3DS to make a call on whether its omission substantially affects gameplay. But for what it's worth, I've played through the Great Deku Tree in Ocarina of Time on 3DS with the 3D on, and I honestly wouldn't have minded if it had been off. ;)

In short: I'm pretty happy with it, and I'm much rather save $40 than see the 3D effects. But if 3D gaming is something you want to get into, obviously you want to go with the 3DS instead of this system. ;)",5.0

"I grew up on Doom. It was probably the first computer game I played as a kid. There are a bunch of homages in this game but at the same time it is it's own game.

This is more like the originals than the previous remake attempt of Doom 3. It is just balls to the walls demons coming at you like crazy. The graphics are great, the sound is great, and the story is ... well, whatever, who cares? They try to throw some story in there and it's fine and all but this game really shines with it's non-stop carnage. If you stop moving and/or shooting, you die. Run is always on by default so they save your pinky from mashing shift the whole time.

"Nintendo made a wise decision enlisting Treasure to develop this game. They are know for their nonstop crazy action games, and this is no exception. It's much more frantic than the 1st game, and the added control given by the wii remote/nunchuck make it a blast to play, but it's by no means easy. I should have picked easy mode since even normal can get a bit difficult at times. Playing two players can help, as do the unlimited continues (youll need them). The audio is top-notch comprised of a mix of orchestrated pieces and techo-anime. It works perfect. You won't be playin this game for the story, either so I won't go into that since its hard to describe. Graphically it's beautiful to look at as you zoom from scene to scene.

"This game is glorious. I'd place it right under Halo, Halo2, Half-Life2 and right above Doom3 in the top 5 best xbox games of all time. There are a few hooks that simply make this game fun.

- Graphics are beautiful. Really gorgeous.

- Soundtrack/score is top notch (Amon Tobin). Listen to the track during the boat mission in which you toss people overboard. It's more beautiful than most Hollywood scores. There is some additional music from fake rock bands scattered throughout the game on radios for a nice touch. Even the added touch of foreign computers having their own particular cultural sounds when you turn them on/off. When a game designer goes to these lengths, you really have something worth while.

- Cool new moves. Ability to knock people over and pull them down from ledges is cool. Grab them through Japanese paper doors. Knock them out from behind doors. All a lot of fun. Game also reminds you how to do them while loading. Good touch.

- Items/gadgets still cool, hacking is especially cool

- They lightened up on the alarms concept

- As with other Splinter Cell games, the scope is global and these spy agencies are real. I like the multi-cultural immersion.

- Co-op with modified levels

- Long game

- Glitch free. No consulting the internet to figure out what went wrong.

- The story doesn't blame everything on Arabs or Islamic fundamentalism. The bad guys are a combo of home grown and global. At one point, you are technically ""at war"".

- Solid upgrade overall over other splinter cell games.

"Fantastic game. I'm new to the Fallout franchise and immediately loved this game. I've beaten it once and currently playing through it again. Total time played so far is about 250+ hours. So that comes out to about 24 cents per hour assuming I never play it again. Compare that to the price of a movie ticket + popcorn. One of my only complaints is that it crashes rarely, but a AAA title like this shouldn't be crashing at all. Be sure to use the 'quicksave' feature frequently so you don't lose any progress. The other complaint is that there's a little bit of balancing issues with the gun called ""Overseer's Guardian"". It's way too powerful. Using that gun makes you feel like you're cheating.

"Have a PS3? Watch Movies? Then you need this.

One of my most-used accessories since the PS3 launch has been this remote control. As a big movie watcher, this is an absolute necessity.

The layout is very nice, easy to use and feels very solid. If you've ever used the PS2 remote control, this is a big improvement.

Every button you'd need is available via the remote, and none of them feel awkwardly placed like the previous remote control. In addition to the standard controls you'd expect, the remote includes blu-ray specific buttons (Red/Green/Blue/Yellow), an Eject button and a PS button (which, if held, allows you to turn the PS3 off).

One of the big benefits with this remote is the bluetooth support - unlike other appliances which require a direct line of sight between the remote and the system, this control allows you to  be in another room and still have full control over the PS3. Sounds useless, but it actually comes in handy if you have anything blocking your PS3's line of sight (or if you want to turn on/off the PS3 from another room).

The remote control has a very nice feel to it, and makes for a much more enjoyable movie-watching experience.

You'll probably find, like myself, that you use this PS3 remote for general navigation for the PSN Store, XMB and even web-browsing. For such a low-price, you just can't go wrong with it.",5.0

"This is the second game in the Legend of Spyro trilogy and is difficult, though not as hard as the third one. It still focuses on combat using attacks and elemental powers, but there are more bosses, and the enemies are harder to defeat. In this game, Spyro can temporarily stop time to slow down opponents and get the upper hand. The elements usable are fire, ice, earth, and electricity. The second attacks for these moves have drastically changed, but are just as useful. Health and breath bars can be increased with masks obtainable in the game, and another elemental power is available if you defeat the game. In the bonus features, artwork and five specialized fights are availabe when meeting certain conditions. All previous characters are in the game, plus a new character called the Chronicler. There is more of a variety of enemies and bosses. The graphics are very good. This game may dissapoint the old Spyro series fans, but anyone who likes a good storyline and tough battles will probably like this game. It recommended that you use the classic controller, not the Wii remote and nunchuk. Note: a movie will come out in theaters on April 10 of 2010 about the previous installment unless it is delayed.",5.0

"Just an awesome game that keeps any zombie fan busy for hours and hours. If you like Resident Evil, Dead Island, Left 4 Dead or any of the Dead Rising games this should do you well!

"If you were a fan of The Stick of Truth, then there's basically no way you won't like this game. The narrative is just as hilarious and (surprisingly) compelling as that of its predecessor and really does a great job of, once again, making this feel like a solid few episodes where the player controls when and how things occur.

The combat mechanics, while more complex on their surface, are every bit as easy to master as the first game, for better or for worse. I love that they changed it (so it didn't just feel like the same thing I already beat a few times), but prefer the fighting in the old one, and its bare-bones Paper Mario style.

Where this one excels beyond TSOT is the polish. Where the first game was rushed at the end and had bare-bones menus and a death screen that was a sort of accidental joke in and of itself, TFBW is just a more complete and fully realized game. The game got pushed back a few times and it shows, in a  very good way.

An easy recommend to fans of the first one and to fans of South Park in general.",5.0

"My company bought an Xbox for the breakroom and about 10 games for it.  Halo immediately became the favorite and has been since December.  Halo is unlike any console game I have ever seen.  In fact, I have yet to see a PC game match is fluidity, realism and near seamless animation.
The campaigns are fun, but in my opinion, not the game's main attraction.  Halo's main attraction would have to be its multiplayer modes.  We have gone so far here as to link up 4 Xboxes and play 8v8 on some of the games larger maps.  What a blast, even our wives would have to admit we are having a better time than they do at their scrapbooking parties.
As far as first person shooters go, Halo is not really my favorite genre.  I prefer the more realistic types like half-life but Halo is just so well done I have to make an exception.  The only flaw I see with the game is that the campaign levels are too repetitive.",5.0
"Like the first game Bioshock 2 was fun, gritty, and captivating. It is better in some ways than the previous game, worse in others. The storyline was not as strong as the first game and some of the gameplay concepts weren't as good.

"The Logitech ChillStream gamepad is by far one of the best gaming controllers I've used in my long gaming history. One of the biggest pros for me is the style of the controller. Based heavily off of the Xbox 360 controllers, it's very easy to map and get used to, especially if you own or have owned a 360 as I have. The feel is almost exact to the 360 controllers as well, so there is nothing to really get used to aside from the fan vents. Now, the controller has 2 fan options, one being a kind of subtle fan that hardly cools the hands or prevents sweating. In that sense, it's kind of useless, but much quieter so it may be optimal for those needing to use it in a quiet environment or for those who casually game and/or have seldom sweating in the palms. The second fan option, however, is much faster and, in turn, louder. It does a magnificent job keeping my hands cool even during intense gaming sessions which prevents the controller from slipping and provides for precision gaming. If your hands are prone to sweating during those intense gaming sessions, and are familiar with the Xbox 360 controller, then I would heavily recommend this controller. For the price, this unit is definitely worth it. If you are a casual gamer, however, or tend to play games that don't use a controller (FPS, RTS) then I'd suggest something cheaper for the sake of price vs. usage.",5.0

"I've tried on and off for the last few years to get my Dual Shock 3 controllers running well on PC (mostly through motionjoy drivers), but always eventually ran into problems (especially when configuring them for wireless play.)  I've also had 2 of the Xbox 360 PC controller adapters crap out on me in the last month and decided to do some digging on alternatives.

Very happy to say this adapter so far has been fantastic.  Installed the drivers, plugged in the adapter, synced a DualShock3 and was using the controller in a matter of 1-2 minutes total.  (Windows 8.1, used the controller in Steam Big Picture as well as several non Steam based games).  There is a switch on the adapter that allows you to toggle between D/Xinput, though I've only been using Xinput (computer recognizes it as an XBOX 360 controller).

I also bought the Wii U Pro controller version and can say it works flawlessly (and quickly!) as well, though the button mapping is literal to the ABXY for Nintendo, and will throw off most people used to the XBOX 360 ABXY placement.

The only question that remains for me is how well built/ long lasting it will be.  If the quality can match the ease of use I'll definitely be looking to them for future PC controller adapters (PS4/ XBox One).",5.0

"When I read the first review here I decided not to purchase the game even though my son (13 years old) had downloaded the demo and loved it.  However, I did decide to rent it and my son loves it. When I asked him what he likes his reply was ""everything.""  When pressed to give specific examples he replied that he likes that you can play as so many different characters, and that missions take place between Season 1 and 2 of the show so things are new.  I know he likes the fact that in the game he can use his points to purchase ""hats and masks"" and change his character's look.  This can get quite humorous when the original slender bodies are topped by some outrageous looking hats, helmets and masks.  It does make it easy to spot your character though!

He's been playing this for the last three days so I know he likes it.  How does this game compare to other Star War games he has played? He played ""The Clone Wars: Lightsaber Duels"" for about 20 minutes before he announced to me that I could return it to the rental store. Thank goodness I didn't buy that. He really likes the ""Lego Star Wars"" games and he played them a lot when we first bought them a couple years ago--but at 13 he has kinda outgrown those versions and finds ""Clone Wars: Republic Heroes"" better.  This game is more advanced that Lego Star Wars.

I also read a review that was criticial of the small size of the characters, but for us this hasn't been an issue.  He's been playing this on a 40-inch LCD screen, so perhaps at half the size this could become an issue.

Bottom line:  This is a fun game with an interesting story line and good graphics.",5.0

"If you enjoyed the other Souls entries, you will enjoy this. I have to admit, the first 10-15 hours I was a bit disappointed, the areas/bosses I faced early didn't seem as exciting as I was expecting. However, It grew on me over time, it does justice as a sequel. There is a vast amount of locations and secrets--I thought I was nearing the end several times, only to be pleasantly surprised. For me, If DS1 was an A+, it's second entry is an A. Has everything you would want from the series, with the exception of being a tad bit less memorable.",5.0
"I have never played a Diablo game before, but after playing III for several hours, it's become one of my favorite games; running around and just annihilating any mob that comes near is simply amazing. The quest system is fun, and although it's kind of strange to have a general chat but no one around, it doesn't bother me. I did not buy it to be another WoW. Thus, I only have played single player so far, so I can't opine about any multiplayer aspects. One thing I will mention is that the box is very nice. The box seems very sturdy, and has some weight to it, but not too much. The box opens up to a glossy cardboard sleeve with the install DVD inside and the serial number to register on battle.net on the outside. Underneath the sleeve are 3 Diablo III guest passes and a WoW guest pass. Also included is a nifty notepad which is underneath the passes; very nice.

OK, let's talk about the elephant in the room; the DRM. The game is tied to your battle.net account, and thus will not run without an internet connection. Folks, this is nothing we didn't already know. We've known for months that Blizzard would require a constant connection. I can, however, sympathize with the people who were unable to log in on release day. One of the reasons I waited a week to buy it. Much has been said about the ""Real Money Auction House,"" that it's the reason for the server instability. I for one really don't care about the ""RMAH,"" and I don't know anyone else who cares either. Ultimately, it is up to you to pass up this game due to the online only thing, that is your decision. I have been on 11hr plane trips, and it would be nice to kill some mobs, but if I really want to game, I can plan ahead and bring something else. The music is fantastic, and the graphics look really nice on my mid-range Radeon HD6870.",5.0
"Firstly, I want to say this isn't an in depth review because I just wanted to rate this game its well deserved 5 stars, and I don't think you can do that unless you write something nowadays :P

The game is just as fun as Melee, and there has been a lot added to it which makes the experience even better (Wifi, more characters, stages, stage building, extended Adventure mode now hours instead of minutes long...etc).

Any fan of fighting action should enjoy this game - it is the type of game that warrants being called ""a system seller."" The fighting in Brawl is most unique in that there are several crazy items and pokeballs that make the experience quite beautifully chaotic.",5.0

"i first got this game at agarage sale. a while later, i learned all the moves and fatalities(though i couldn't perform them) it was way funner than the crappy mk2 genesis game, which i also had. any day i always mk1 first. here's why:

MUSIC-the music is the original tunes, only maDE WITH VIDEO GAME BEEPS so its more cartoony sounding. still very fun to listen to. i usually get lost in it:)

GRAPHICS-meh. the graphics are fair, but they're not the best. the oni in goro's lair still blink, the monks move their heads, clouds roll. the graphics seem pixely chunky, but heir pretty good.

FUN-this game is fustrating! if i make it on easy difficulty, its not challenging. if i put it on hard difficulty, its too challenging! medium is perfect for newbies.

BLOOD-blood can be activated via a cheat in this game. even then, its not the best. only a few pints, or dots spill out of their heads when you punch em. but when you uppercut them, its very fun to see drops of blood fall from the air. and who who could forget scorpion's bloody spear? the fatalities are gruesome, thought not as bloody. although subbies fatality as ass-cool to see blood repeatedly drip from their spines in his fat.

MOVES-the classic special move are easy to do if you have a decent controller. if you do them more than once, they drain more health!

OVERALL-this is a fun classic.fatalities are easy and funto watch, gameplay is decent and not repeatitive, music is beautiful. buy this!!",5.0

"Dragon Warrior II (known as ''Dragon Quest II'' in Japan) is a fantasy RPG for the NES. It was released in Japan in 1987, and in North America in 1990. It wasn't released in Europe, but it can be downloaded and played on an NES emulator.

In the game, you play the Prince Of Midenhall, the Prince Of Cannock, and the Princess Of Moonbrooke. You must go on a journey to destroy an evil wizard, and a monster called Malroth in order to restore peace to the land.

Dragon Warrior II is one of my all time favorite RPGs. This is a super good RPG for the NES. The game is really colorful and has beautiful graphics for an NES game. It isn't too hard, but if you play this game, you MUST use a walkthrough, because some parts are almost impossible to guess what you must do.

"I received Crosswords DS for my Birthday in May.  I previously had purchased Atari's Puzzler but ended up passing it along to a friend because the puzzles were too easy and I couldn't stand the ditty of a song it played.  When I received this, I was hooked on my Bejeweled Twist and was leery that this Crosswords DS was going to be more of the same that Puzzler offered.  I finally took out my Bejeweled Twist and popped in the Crosswords DS.  This has become one of my favorite DS games.

The ditty song is much more conducive to kick back and chilling.  The word search games are great and very easy for the stylus to stay on track and highlight the words you find. The large word searches are more challenging as you have to move the screen around to see different areas of the word search. It isn't just what you see on the screen, though it is on the small word searches.

The crosswords I found were fun to solve and lay between not too easy and not to hard. The game had no problem identifying the letters I wrote with my stylus (something that I had trouble with when I played Puzzler). The puzzles are grouped on how hard the puzzle is and by size puzzle you want to do (ie. 4x4 or other sizes). Another thing I enjoyed about Crossword DS is that on both the Word Searches and the Crosswords, you choose which puzzle is to be worked next.  If you don't want to work the next puzzle the game has in line, you don't have to. Don't like the time it took to work the puzzle? You can always go back and try in the future and re-work the puzzle.

The third option of games is the Anagrams.  This game is really fun, especially if you like the game Boggle or the computer game Text Twist.  I found this game very similiar to the computer game Text Twist.  A bunch of letters are given in each game and you have to make words out of them.  If by the end of the game you just don't see another word, you can look at your list on the other side's screen and you can see where the last word stopped and where the next word begins...so you know that the word you are missing and looking for is alphabetically between the two.  If you still are stumped, you can ""Give Up"".  If you do so, eventually you will get this game to pop up again sometime in your games line-up.  If you complete the Anagram list, you are finished with that game and it doesn't come up again.

At any point that you need to stop, all of three of the game options do have an option to ""Save"". In each of the catagories of Word Search, Crossword and Anagram the game will allow one saved game.  Where you can come back at a later time and pick up where you left off.

Although I haven't finished all the puzzles yet. This appears to be a game where you can clear out your puzzle solving.  Put it in your game case and shelve it for a period of time.  Then get it out and start all over again. If it was a long enough period, I would forget what my puzzle solving answers are and it would be like a fresh game all over again.

This is a truly enjoyable game if you are interested in word games and puzzles. I find it de-stressing if I've had a hectic day and I want to unwind before bedtime. After owning and working some of the games, I would have no problem buying a copy and giving it as a Birthday or Christmas gift....or simply recommeding it to a friend who is searching for a new word puzzle game for their DS.",5.0

"Up until now, I had most all of the NASCAR video games in my library from NASCAR 95 to the new Inside Line but I didn't have this one. The reason I didn't own this one was because it was so difficult to find. If I did find one it was used up, scratched, no manual or box. Most all of the sellers wanted a fortune for them in this kind of condition. Why?  In 2003 Papyrus filled bankruptcy so EA purchased the rights to NASCAR games. All of the NASCAR 2003 Season games were taken off the shelves, so all publication of this game had to stop. NASCAR 2003 Season was also the last PC NASCAR to be published! EA made the rest of their games for console. This is also the only NASCAR game to be rated by real Cup drivers as having true simulated- realistic physics. The one cool thing about this game is the patch v 1.2. that was left behind by Papyrus. After the patch is installed, custom content can be downloaded into the game files. There is cool stuff like the IROC Series from the 80's and the 2003 cars with beer logos. There's also the 60's 70's, 80's and 90's cup cars to download. Several versions of the famous no 3 car can be found too. The 2013 cars of tomorrow can also be installed. Tracks are another cool thing that can be downloaded like North Wilkesbore and Riverside. Get this game and you'll love the downloadable content!

NASCAR Racing 2003 Season Graphics Tweaks. This also works the same on NR4 and NR2002.

Open up your ""C:/Papyrus/Nascar Racing 2003 Season"" directory

 (this is the default path, modify as needed if installed elsewhere).

Open your CORE.INI file with Notepad and make the following changes:

[FileLRUCache]
Cachesize=4194304

Just put a 1 in front of the number. It should read:

[FileLRUCache]
Cachesize=14194304

Next, look for the:

[Memory]
Maxblocksize=131072

The amount of RAM you have in your pc will need to be calculated.

Just multiply your RAM by 1024.

(Example: 5121024=524288)

Then insert that number so it reads:

[Memory]
Maxblocksize=524288

Save the CORE.INI file and close it.

Next, open the REND_OGL.INI (if running in OpenGL) or

the REND_DXG.INI (if running in Direct3D) with Notepad.

Look for the line that reads.

TextureSetSize= ""number""

The ""number"" is what you want to replace. There is a formula for this...

( MB of video RAM) x (1048576) - ( 4 x Screen Width) x ( Screen Height) x

(BPP) Bits Per Pixel, use (2) for 16bit or (4) for 32bit color.

NOTE: 16bit color will be less of a performance hog then 32bit color

HUH! WHAT THE?

The proper settings are listed here. Just look and match up your resolution

 with your color depth and you'll find the answer to the formula for your

 TextureSetSize.

AI Tweaking Guide TRACKS.....Remember to lower the aggression in opponent manager for better racing.

Modify the track. INI file:

Braking

If they brake too early going into a turn, increase the value for:

ai_decel_modifier

If they brake too late going into a turn, decrease the value for:

ai_decel_modifier

If you find the AI brakes too abruptly, decrease the value for:

ai_dlongpad_scale

Turn Speed

If they are too slow through the turns, increase the value for:

ai_grip_modifier

If they are too fast through the turns, decrease the value for:

ai_grip_modifier-----1.5 to 1.0

Straighaway Speed

If the AI pulls away from you on the straights, increase the value for:

ai_drag_modifier'-----------07 to 10

If you blow by the AI on the straight, decrease the value for:

ai_drag_modifier

Acceleration

If coming out of a turn or on starts/restarts, the AI accelerates to

slow, increase the value for:

ai_accel_modifier

If coming out of a turn or on starts/restarts, the AI accelerates to

quickly, decrease the value for:

ai_accel_modifier

ai_dlongpad_scale =
This is what the AI use in braking Zones.--------------- 10.0 to 14.0

ai_inverse_slipcurve_k =

This is how much angle they need while cornering...less of an angle =

decelerated corners

ai_grip changes the AI speed ALL around the track

ai_accel changes the AI speed out of corners and at the restart

ai_decel changes the AI speed into the corners

ai_drag changes the AI speed down the straights. This is more important

 at tracks over 1 mile in length, but works for short tracks too.

ai_line_modifier makes them move from minrace to maxrace more erratically.

 This is a VERY sensitive value. 1.00 is default and 1.05 makes a mess.

 1.02 is pushing it.

Other lines to play with but these are not real speed issues but

agression

 issues........

ai_panic_decel - lower number makes them react to problems better
---------------------------------------------------------6.0 to 5.o

ai_dlongpad_scale = lower makes them brake more smoothly and not run into

 slowing cars (think of a car having a bubble around it; bigger the number

, the bigger the bubble is in FRONT and BEHIND the car). A real low number

 will make an AI on the outside think he can fit his full car length into

a half car length between two cars on the inside.

ai_dlat_pad - same bubble but beside the cars. Lower will make them try to

 get tighter and can cause more problems.

ai_squeeze_pcnt = not sure how this works, but increasing the value from

0.0 to 0.5 will make them move more.---------------------0.0 to 0.5",5.0

"My son just turned 8 and I loaded Mechwarrior 4 on his Windows 7 system he received for his birthday. This game is proof that great games are great no matter what else is available or happens over time. I loaded this on my Vista system as well and we can play head to head over my home network with no issues. 10 years later and this game is still a fantastic sim, looks great considering all of the action going on, and is better then any of the other competitors on the market today. If you can find if for a descent price, definitely it is a buy.",5.0
"Rocksmith 2014 for the Xbox 360 is a great, proven product.  Coming from a guitar newbie, I have to say it's been a complete joy to use Rocksmith and steadily be introduced to playing the guitar.  I have music experience with other instruments, but zero with the guitar.  No matter your skill level in music or guitar, Rocksmith 2014 is a great resource.  To beat it all, it's fun, too.

With the necessary cable, you are up and running with Rocksmith in a matter of minutes and ready to begin your journey.  The great thing is that like I said before, no matter your skill level you will benefit.  While I'm coming at it from a beginner level I can see that even more advanced users can improve their playing ability.

The music selection is fairly mixed and offers some great hits that will fit the tastes of most players.  Many may be fooled into thinking this is just a ""game"" but in reality it's learning opportunity that is fun.  Even after you have gone through or mastered lead guitar, you can go back and learn bass.  You can play songs and you can go through many lessons.

Rocksmith 2014 is a great investment that will provide many hours of entertainment and learning opportunities.",5.0

"This is one of the best games I have ever played. The freedom this game allows is incredible. No wonder everyone (except angry parents) loves this game so much. It is the perfect 'adult' play set.

Or perhaps you would like to go adventuring, searching for secrets. Vice City delievers- with 100 hidden packages (get all 100 for a cool surprise!), 35 Rampages, 36 unique stunt jumps, and 15 stores to rob you'll never get bored terrorizing the city.
Or maybe you would just like to carouse the huge sun bleached city, listening to the 80's tunes (including hits by Blonide, Run DMC, and MUCH MUCH more)and spoof commercials, while mowing down 'innocent' pedestrians and running from the fuzz. The possibilities are endless. GTA Vice City is like 10 games rolled into one delicious, hillarious, and incredible package. If you haven't experienced Vice City you must get the game. Now.

This game is very cool and passes the time away. All the games you can think of are in in this game. It is pretty realistic using the wii remote to throw and shoot. It is fun to play by yourself or with a friend playing head to head. The only thing is when you unlock games they are the same games but something in it just to make it a little harder. Over all it is a great game to buy. It makes you use the wii remote in alot of different ways.,5.0
"I hesitated to get his game as Mass Effect 1 received lukewarm reviews.  This is a lot of fun with great graphics and a very cinematic feel. It can be a bit cumbersome to go through all the dialogue to stay in touch with what is going on in the game but it is worth it for the immersion experience.  The voice acting is excellent and the dialogue is done well.  Unlike many games with cheesy lines and poor acting, this is on the scale of a decent Hollywood movie. If you are into run-n-gun like Left for Dead, do not buy this game. If you like RPG Shooters, BUY THIS.

The battles are fun albeit a bit unchallenging so far but fun none the less.  The weapons and mod systems are easy to use and controlling your squad is straight forward (but challenging to master, thankfully) via to a well designed interface.  The slick thing is there are various elements needed to build and research upgrades and such you need to locate given amounts to obtain new items.  Although there is no rhyme or reason as to where to look for these (it seems you stumble on them) maybe that was part of the design.

Your choices in dialogue do have an effect as I have saved and went back and tried a different tact with different results.....very cool. You can be a ball buster, fight, threaten and control with an iron fist or a nice guy helping others or whatever blend you choose and your character builds on the fly. While there is a point system to assign to skills, it is hassle free and simple.

From playing in an unfolding story to battling, gaining info, researching and earning new skills & weapons along with some of the general missions to find things that are needed and transfer to those in need, this is a mercenary, bounty hunter, scavenger game that so far been fun. Lastly, I generally prefer 1st Person but the camera and angle in this are excellently done so I have adapted to this quickly and like it (unlike Gears of War)",5.0

"As a person who has both the PS3 and the 360 and enjoys both for there different boons, I just have to add something to the big debate about which is superior.  Alot of people have seen the base stats for the systems and see that the peak triangle calculation rate for the PS3 is higher and etc etc.  Alot of odd ball numbers that few but the most hardcore of gamers and computer geeks really understand completely.

Here is a summation of the reality of that debate that I have learned from programmers themselves.

The PS3 is only better on paper while being tested under extremely favorable circumstances.

The PS3 runs one powerfull processor and several smaller processors.

The 360 runs 3 powerful identical processors.

Here is the real problem.  The PS3 takes alot different and more complex programing to gain the edge that it has a potential for.  Problem is it litterally is 10 times harder to make games for and althought the potential numbers look better to actually gain those numbers while playing a game is simply not possible.  No game company would take the time to build a game that way.

The reason is that if you get all of the processors working at peak capacity in harmony you get the numbers they put out.  This is unrealistic.

First of all the processors are designed to do different tasks and so are not programmed to work that way.

It's alot easier to program for the 360 since first off it's a directx based platform and second it has 3 identical processors that can easily be programmed to work in harmony.  It's actually alot easier to get better performance out of the 360 even though the Peak Stats are not as good on paper.

Now here is the issue.  ***AND PLEASE I'M NOT BASHING I'M SIMPLY SHARING WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM ACTUAL PROGRAMMERS***  Like I said I have both and enjoy both tremendously.

However the issue is this.  The PS2 was ten times harder to make games for than the original XBOX but there were 10 times as many PS2's out on the market so it made sense to make games for it first then possibly cross platform to the XBOX.

Now, the PS3 is 10 times harder to make games for than the 360 but there are 10 times LESS consoles in homes.

This is why you see alot of former Sony exclusives jumping ship and programming for 360 first then cross platforming to PS3.  It's easier and more lucrative.  Bottom Line.

These game companies are in it for money bottom line.  Why spend ten times more time and money making a game for a system that has 10 times less potential to sell the product?

So bottom line is this and test it yourself if you don't beleive it.  If a game is made first for 360 and then cross platformed to PS3 it will run better and smoother on the 360.

Vice versa if it is made first for the PS3 then cross platformed you will notice it runs alot better and smoother on the PS3.

So you can probably assume that alot more games will come out first for the 360 and then be cross platformed and you will probably have alot more 360 exclusives than we've seen in the past but still you will have all your Japanese Fav's like GT5 and FF series on the PS3 working seamlessly.

All in all they are both great systems.  And don't forget about the Smash hit Wii!",5.0

"This IMO is the best game of 2010. The story is phenomenal, the gameplay is fun, and the art style in the game is really unique. There hasn't been a game Fallout 3 and the .hack saga that has gotten me this emotionally attached to the story, and how I was rooting for the people to succeed.  This game switches around game play styles; which gives it a nice fresh Varity to the pacing of the game.

One of the best experiences in a videogame I've had. It kept me captivated along the way and wondering what was going to happen next. It's basically about a father's journey to cure his daughter's illness so she could have a normal life, and spirals from there. The world this game is based in is pretty bleak and most of humanity has been wiped out by shades and the Black Scrawl.

The gameplay is one of the most varied I have played in a single title before. You have your typical 3rd person camera that takes place in most of the game; like when you visit towns or most of the battles in the game. Along with those you have an over the top, fixed camera, text adventure, or many others that makes this game great.

You can also choose to fish or cultivate plants, which are tied to trophies/achievements as well. Fishing is fun, and it's hard at first but once you get practice and do the fishing minigames, it becomes quite addicting. I love the fact they added in gardening too as well, the plants have stages and they grow based on the real life time that has passed.

I personally think the graphics in this game are quite unique and have an artist look to them. They are not the next generation graphics, but they work well with this game I found them pleasing to look at. The areas you visit are visual appeasing, and the cool look of the enemies and bosses make up why these graphics work.

The music in this game is amazing. I absolutely love the songs they have playing at moments, and really add to the emotional ties of the story. The battle music is nice too, and I haven't quite heard music like this in a game since .hack. Sound effects in this game are nice, you hear fish moving around when you fish them out, and you hear the sword hitting the shades.

Just as a side note this is a game created by Cavia, and just ported here by Square Enix (Like what Atlus did with Demons souls, and many other games). While I'm glad that Square ported this game so we are able to play it in English, it's still Cavia's baby. Also on top of this, Cavia was basically being shut down in the making of this game, so this is their final game and a great send off. I just wanted to write a bit about this since it saddens me when people say its Squares game, and not Cavia's epic sendoff.

Overall I have to say this is my favorite game of all time, it has been so rewarding to me as a gamer that I was sad that it was over and was yearning for more. The way the final ending is set up introduces me to something I have never experienced in a game before, which says a lot about Cavia's story telling. Right now this is my pick of GOTY 2010. Absolutely buy this title, no matter the price for it.

Length: This game took me around 50 hours to beat this game and all endings, but I also did a lot of side missions, fished, and cultivated. You can average around 20 hours if you do nothing else but play the game and watch the cut scenes.

Trophies/Achievements: To get all of these you have to spend a lot of time farming for items, cultivating, fishing, along with beating the game a few times. I have yet to get the platinum and I'm at 60 hours right now, and only have less than half the weapons upgraded. It will take some time to get this one, but it could be a nice bragging completion to get.

Positives:
*Awesome story that's emotional
*Fun game play
*The graphics are unique
*Great multiple endings that add to the characters
*Awesome soundtrack
*Gardening and fishing FTW
*Cool Weapons

Negatives:
*Getting all the acheivements/trophies gets tedius",5.0

"I have played all the Final fantasy games ever released on every console and I have been waiting for this game to be released like.. forever! I must say I love it even though it is different from previous games.
People are complaining and they have the right, but change is good sometimes, doing the shops in the save menu, this is like Final Fantasy VII:Crisis Core and that wasn't bad either. We do not need towns people, we are living a story. Why not accept the change?
Look at the graphics, the animation, the music and the characters. What else do you want? This game is the reason I bought a PS3 in the beginning. I heard it was gonna be a PS3 exclusive. Then they released it to the XBOX which was disappointing, but the PS3 version is much better, I guess that's a win for me.

Characters: Tetsuo Nomura has always been a genius. The characters are lovable and the costumes is just perfect.
Music: Great theme song and great OST.
Battle system: New and different since you only control Lightening character, but fun.
Story: Interesting and needs a lot of attention to get its specific details and purpose.
Overall: The game is worth every penny and bravo for Square Enix.",5.0

Excellent protection for a great old school hand held game. ..,5.0
Very nice looking figure.,5.0
"I bought this case because it was cheap and wanted it to protect my Zelda controller (like pretty much everyone else).  I also tend to have some lengthy gaming sessions, and so I also bought a Nyko Uboost (which is fantastic, btw).  Unfortunately the two of these do not fit together as they come....

But fear not!  If you have a Dremel, about 15 minutes of work will not only make this case work with the Uboost, but ALSO make it fit in the cradle!  Since the Uboost sticks out from the bottom of the controller, the plastic case won't interfere with the cradle positioning.

I am by no means an expert with a Dremel, and I did a pretty decent job cutting and sanding with it to make the Uboost fit.  The only place you really need to be careful is at the bottom where the two pieces of the case latch together.  No modifications need to be made to the front half of the clamshell, so just separate the two halves carefully before starting work on the back piece.

I posted some pictures as well.  You can see that it fits in the cradle with the Uboost and the case on as well.",5.0

"I received a PS2 this Christmas and CoD3 was the first game I played.  I had not played the other 2 so I can't compare.  For me I had fun with this game.  It was many hours of play.

Basically your rotate between scenes playing the Americans, British SAS, Poles, and Canadians.

Game play took a little for me as I was not used to the game controller but I did pick it up.

Probably the hardest for me was hill 262 with the Poles.  One that took a bit was defending a town(I forget which part of the game) but it involved finding areas to blow with gas mains.

Some weapons were short for ammo, especially if you shoot a great deal.  The German weapons taken from the dead didn't seem to remain for a long time so you have only so much time.

The hand to hand scenes seemed way to easy and the rifle but attack seemed hard (probably due to my lack of experience with the game controller).

There are extras on the game.  You can see art work, the movies in the game and interviews with some WWII veterens.  No German vets however.

Overall I am happy with the game and will replay it and see if things are different.

Do get a memory card as the game does auto saves.",5.0

"This review is for the Hasbro Family Fun Pack for Xbox One. If you are interesting in getting this set of games, you know this is not going to be the same as a triple A title game (which also cost 3 times more). While the graphics are fine, they are definitely not the focal point of a video game based on traditional board games. Still, I was curious. I like Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly, Scrabble and Risk so this seemed like something worth checking out, and a nice break from first person shooters and role playing games.

These games are meant to be played with friends, I didn't even try to play them solo with AI players although it is an option if it's just 2 humans and you want to play with more players. There is also the ""live"" mode which requires you to sign up for a separate service which I found annoying. Still, once you get all set up, the games are easy to get going and play. Each game is fun and lively and has its own twist on the originals.

One of my favorites is Monopoly, with it's 3D rendition of the classic game, and the way the game has you play the ""real"" rules (this eliminates the constant arguments my family has with what the rules actually are), although you are able to make rule exceptions for certain things. The animations and general gameplay is whimsical and enjoyable and it really got me back into monopoly again after not playing it for years.

I also really enjoyed Trivial Pursuit, but unlike Monopoly it was not because it is similar in style to the board game version. This Trivial Pursuit is set up like a game show where you have to ""buzz in"" with the correct answer. It is very, very different from the board game and the questions are much easier than the Trivial Pursuit games I have played in the past. Still, it's a very fun, fast paced trivia game that 4 players can play and have a lot of fun with. This is probably my favorite game to just pick up and play really quick. Games can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 10 minutes with the longer mode. I feel like the game is worth the price just for the Trivial Pursuit portion alone, although Trivial Pursuit aficionados may be turned off by its name being used on a totally different game show style game. To me, it's better this way. Traditional Trivial Pursuit is a great game, but I don't think it would translate well to a video game console as it is so basic in nature. The game show feature makes it fun and lively and I had fun playing with people aged 15 through 45.

The other 2 games I didn't play as much, but I did enjoy them. Scrabble is fairly traditional and was enjoyable to play. The Scrabble games seem to take about the same amount of time as a normal Scrabble game, without all the setup of course. Risk is also fairly like the board game and I played one full game of it with some friends and really enjoyed it. It does take a while, like Monopoly, but overall it's a nice addition and a classic strategy game that I would never think could translate well to console, but Ubisoft did a good job.

I should mention that if you have a smartphone, you can use the Microsoft Smart Glass app to use as a type of controller for some of the games, if not all of them. I only tried this on Monopoly and it works great. Another great use of near ubiquitous technology to augment the gaming experience.

I saw some reviews saying they didn't like the user interface, but I think that's personal preference. I think it's fine. I have no trouble navigating through the various games and the different options. I don't like that you have to sign up for that service to play live games, but that's totally optional and not required. There is paid DLC (downloadable content) you can purchase such as fun Monopoly maps, and you can make your own version of Monopoly ($10). Overall, you have to consider the cost for a game like this and what you are getting and it's hard to argue that it's not a great deal. If you have a Xbox One or PS4 and are looking for a fun game the whole family can play that doesn't involve dancing, this one is great if your family is into board games at all.",5.0

"If there is one word to describe this game, it is: HUGE! I mean there is so much to do in this game. I've played for about 4 hours and I have only completed 2% of the game-it is that big!

On this fictional country: ""Panau"", there are tons of hidden objects, easter eggs, vehicles, buildings to destroy, and side missions which some complain about being too repetitive. But I mean really, what sandbox game have you ever played in which the side missions were not too repetitive? You could probably find only a few if at best for most of them are highly repetitive! inFamous was probably the most repetitive game I've ever played and the graphics were not even that great! But tons of people love that game-I was so bored by it after 2 days! The variability in missions are fine in Just Cause 2 and there are a number of approaches you can take upon successfully beating them.

As for the the storyline and cutscenes, they remind me of the days of yore when you had those cheesy PSOne movies where the people look side to side when talking! But you know what, this was a perfect sacrifice. To make a world this big without any loading problems, glitches, or even screen tearing-you gotta cut production on those cutscenes-it only makes sense to do so. And besides, I have only been enthralled by only a few video game story lines and Uncharted 1 & 2 are two of those. So usually in my opinion, cut scenes or video game story lines are pointless. I'm all about do and less talk! The actual in-game graphics are outstanding. Trust me-do a sky dive from 20,000ft at sunrise in the game and you will be blown away! There are such rich and full detail-its ridiculous! I mean, on a clear day you can see clearly into the bottom of the ocean! Yes! You can see fish, coral, sand ripples, sea shells, even underwater currents that sweep sand along!

The best part of this game would definitely be your trusty grappling hook attachment! I just love this! For those that have played it, it's not like ""Batman: Vengence"" for PS2 where you only have predetermined grappling points which I thought was kind of lame considering you were BATMAN! Anything that is a solid, you can attach to! Even the bottom floor of a lake! Coupled with the disposable and infinite stunt parachutes makes these great character accessories. It's also always great when you can tether the grappling hook to a moving enemy jeep onto the road and see it flip over with all it's passengers! Nice!

Now some people complain about the in game controls for vehicles and such. I'm not so sure why this is. For me, the controls were very easy to get used to! The cool thing (which I wish most games gave you the option!) is that you can select your trigger (R1 or R2, L1 or L2) preferences for weapon shooting. I prefer the R1 and L1. I never liked using R2 and L2 for shooting and I have always hated that change once PS3 came around. But again that's just me.

Anyway, one last great thing about this game and I am pretty certain that this is a PS3 exclusive, is that you can capture videos directly from the game and either upload to youtube or save as a video file on your PS3 hard drive. This comes in handy when you would like to document some easter egg locations for your friends or compare stunt manuevers/mission approaches.

This game is terrific! This game is so big/intense that I traded in 4 other games that I got bored with just to commit my time to do this one!

"In many ways, Alan Wake reminds me of the old ""point and click"" adventure games I played on the computer as a kid. You are propelled through the game by a strong narrative, dialogue, characters, and pacing. Of course, though the game takes cues from the old school adventure games (as well as some TV shows, like ""Twin Peaks""), it wisely adopts modern control schemes, playing in the typical third person, over the shoulder style that has become very popular over the past two console generations. It is a very linear experience, but that's just the way I like my games- focused with the emphasis being on pacing, fun, and story. This game truly is the ""psychological suspense thriller"" that it claims to be!",5.0

"first of all, This game is not as easy as some might think. I just found the porthole to castle B, and spent 2 hours wondering around the castle and not getting anywhere! you almost definately need a guide to play this game. Still, this game has a classic Castlevania feel to it, almost like I'm playing castlevania 4 again, with the return of a belmont in the staring role, the dangling whip tactic, and the simple music, and the castlevania MUST: a clock tower. The music isn't so bad. you can even hear a familiar Bach motif in the ""entrance"" area. I also like the clock tower theme. Kind of has a frantic feel to it.
Also, if you make it to the end credits, the ""entrance"" theme is played remixed to Circle of the Moon Quality. It almost sounds like an actual orchestra playing it. a very nice reward for beating the game",5.0

"So far this game is at the top of my list for this year. I love strategy games (especially turn-based) and RPGs and this one delivers. The best thing about this game is the combat. It has a decent storyline too, and an open world. It's sort of opposite to Final Fantasy 13 in those regards (not really, I'm being a little hard on FF13).

There are challenge encounters (red dots on the map that you have the option to do, usually with really good rewards) that are fun and make you rethink your strategies multiple times. You can grind up and have a little easier time on encounters but you can still get owned by a boss if you do it completely wrong, but there's usually some good hints on how to kill stuff based on the area and what people say. It has a small penalty for losing to an encounter (have to pay money to retry, or you can just reload if you just saved) so there's a reason to focus on winning in battles.",5.0

"Halo notwithstanding, this has to be my favorite game for the Xbox 360. This game so freakin' awesome! It's certainly the most violent game on the 360 - definitely not for kids! But that's a bonus in my book. This game is built from the ground up for the hardcore gamer, for sure!

That said, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers here. I loved Ninja Gaiden Black, so I had high hopes for Ninja Gaiden 2. And while it is still a spectacular game, there are a few glaring flaws where it just comes up short. So lets get those out of the way first, shall we?

THE BAD THINGS:

1. A nonsensical story. I'm sorry, but none of the story really makes any darn sense. Especially when compared to the first game. All the story boils down to is just a flimsy excuse to string a bunch of unrelated levels together. So don't pay much attention to it. Also, I thought Ryu's whole family was dead. Was that not established in the first game? Again, you just gotta ignore this stuff and enjoy the game for what it is. The game is about ACTION. Forget everything else!

2. Too many bland environments. While enemies are lavishly detailed, the environments are often hit and miss. Some are quite beautiful. But then in the very next one you are walking down some drab hallway or cave that looks like something straight out of a PS1. Seems like the environments in NGB were a lot more detailed. They at least had a lot more thought put into them. There was a lot of climbing and 3D thinking involved. Not in this game.

3. Bad instructions. The manual is bare bones, which is fine. But I wish I had had some explanation of how to use Ninja Cinema at least. I finally figured out how to download some of the videos from the people on the leaderboard, but I still can't figure out how to upload videos. It always says, ""You are not ranked on this leaderboard"". What the heck does that mean? I AM ranked! I may be ranked 6,999 out of 7,000 but by God, I'm still ranked!

4. Slowdown. Yes, there is some slowdown, which I found surprising. This game pushes the Xbox to the limits it seems. That's all well and good until the action mounts up. In reality this rarely happens though. Just enough for you to notice it on occasion. After a while, you don't notice it at all.

5. Limited wall jumping. This is big for me. In NGB, one of the most important fighting techniques was wall jump attacks and spamming Flying Swallows. Not in this game. It seems they have tried to penalize players like me by taking almost all climbable surfaces away. It especially becomes noticeable in the Trial challenges and the boss battles. Like it or not, you're pretty much ground-bound.

6. No story in mission mode. Mission mode is great, but it is Xbox Live DLC, so you'll have to buy it separately. I didn't mind that at all, and it is definitely worth the money. But while Mission Mode from NGB contained a complete mini-story toward the end, you won't find anything like that here. It's fairly bare-bones.

7. Glitches. My game froze two or three times. No big deal, but still annoying. Especially once when it was right at the end of finishing a level, and I had to do it over again. What a bummer.

8. Way too linear. Unlike NGB, NG2 has virtually no exploration. That game had more open levels and lots of places where you had to think in three dimensions. Here, you're just level grinding from one hallway to the next. And while taking all the thought out of it does let you just concentrate on the fighting, it's still kind of annoying. You would think game developers would be better at this by now.

9. No unlockables. This is a big one for me. The Xbox Ninja Gaiden included all 3 NES games as unlockables. NGB included the Arcade game. This game has got NOTHING. That is totally inexcuseable! Expecially considering how cheap and easy it is to incorporate that old source code. Maybe this is because the game was produced through Microsoft, not Techmo. I don't know why, but whatever the reason, it leaves me feeling irritated. This game should have had SOMETHING, dang it! IMO, it should have had all four!

10. DLC Skins. What the heck? In NGB, skins were an unlockable reward for being an awesome player. But now you have to pay for them through Xbox Live! How annoying is that? It just further underscores the ""no unlockables"" problem.

11. Too much boobage. Yeah, yeah... I know a lot of guys will disagree with me here. But I've gotta say, I honestly do NOT like seeing every female in these games depicted with double-D size breasts! There. I said it. The giant cleavage is distracting. It's annoying. And frankly, it's demeaning to women. A real woman - one who was capable of the gymnastics that the female heroines do in these games - would likely have so little body fat that she would have hardly any breasts at all. I know, I know... this is only a game. We're not trying to be realistic here. But is it really necessary for game developers to treat all women like nothing more than sex objects? I just can't stand how Team Ninja does this, and they do it in all their games. (Get real, guys! Stop treating your game audience like we're all super-horny teenage boys.)

THE GOOD THINGS:

1. Cool villains. I liked the enemies in this game. They were varied, and all pretty fun to play against. Yeah, some were cheap. But what would a NG game be without enemies taking cheap shots?

2. More blood and increased carnage. It ain't rated ""M"" for nothing, baby! This game is VIOLENT. A LOT more violent than the first one. Blood spews and sprays, body parts fly, and heads roll. Definitely not a game you want to buy for your 8 year old nephew. It's tons of fun, though :)

3. Obliteration techniques. You've still got Ultimate techniques, which look cool as ever. But now you also have the finishing moves, called Obliteration techniques. These are easy and fun to pull off, and sweet to watch.

5. Interesting new weapons. I liked most of the new weapons. It has some really neat ones, like the Kusuri-gama, which is chain-and-sickle affair. And the Eclipse Sycthe, which is somewhat similar in execution to the Dark Dragon Blade, or the Unlabored Flawlessness. (That weapon rules. Once you find it, you pretty much have no need to use any other weapon ever again.) Some weapons from NGB are missing and some make a return, like the Lunar Staff. I did miss the Nunchucks, but the Tonfa make up for that somewhat.

6. Awesome new Ninpo. I disagree with others here who say that the new Ninpo is worthless. I think they are all pretty neat, and awesome to use. I found each one suited to specific situations, and used them all. Art of the Inferno is still a fave, of course. But Art of the Piercing Void has its uses too. Also, the new screen effects for Ninpo use are beautiful - they are a VERY nice addition! The ninpo has to aimed now, but so what? If anything, that at least adds a LITTLE skill to it :)

7. A long game. It is not short, so you do get your money's worth.

8. A good camera. Unlike others, I have no complaints about the camera. It usually put me where I wanted to be. Only tricky part was on the rope climbs, but no biggie.

9. Mission Mode. This is super-fun and well-worth its price as Xbox Live Downloadable Content. It includes 24 missions. Of those, 16 are ""Karma Attack"" missions and 8 are ""Survival"" missions. All are super-hard and challenging. In Survival, you are given a unique weapon with which to face unending waves of enemies, with your goal to rack up enough karma before dying to get the medals. There is 500,000 for Steel, 1,000,000 for Bronze, 1,500,000 for Gold, and finally, the Ultra-HARD-to-get 2,000,000 karma for Gold! It is a TON of fun, if you enjoy that kind of thing.

10. Leaderboards. It's fun to see where you rank with your friends on the leaderboards. It is quite astonishing to see how much karma some of the top players have. Those guys must play the game 16 hours a day, every day.

11. Ninja cinema. This too was a nice addition, once you figure it out. It allows you to record clips of yourself. It is best used during boss fights or during Mission Mode, where you can replay your victory afterwards to feel that rush again (only a little more relaxed this time!). It is fun to watch yourself play, and enjoy seeing how awesome a player you are :) The classic cinema filter was nice, too.

12. Xbox Live Achievements. These are always fun, no matter what game. And NG2's do not disappoint.

13. Bone-crushingly difficult. This could be good or bad, depending on your point of view. I thought the first half of the game was super-easy. But then the difficultly level suddenly ratcheted up to unbelievable proportions. Toward the end of the game, I honestly felt like throwing in the towel. I mean, all the never-ending multiple boss fights with no save stations start wearing on your nerves after a while. And when you are dying OVER and OVER, it gets a little disheartening sometimes. But I hung in there. And with the help of youtube, I made it through. Now I've walked the Way of the Warrior, and beaten all the Missions too! ""Yeah, that's nothing,"" some of you may say. Well, you are better than I then, my friend! This game is HARD. I mean, punch you in the stomach and knock you out HARD!

THE CONCLUSION:

The game does have a few flaws. Some parts feel a little rushed, like they could have worked on some stuff more but they just ran out of time. But the fighting is polished.

And really, I just can't talk about this game without comparing it to Ninja Gaiden Black. Ninja Gaiden Black was perfection. This game is not. Great, yes. But just a little shy of perfection. Of course, If you've never played Ninja Gaiden Black, then maybe you won't even notice. Or care. In any case, I give it 4.75 stars out of 5.

It is worth buying, definitely worth playing. Nothing can quite match the awesomeness you feel when you charge up Ryu and watch him go apes--- on everyone. Will there be a Ninja Gaiden 3? I sure hope so!

Remember, Honor the Way of the Ninja!
And Peace out, Ninja dogs! Word.

"For a game of its age, it has a lot of replay value. The graphics are colorful and the music is famous for its catchy and well produced sound. Using the expensive MMC5 mapper (a special nintendo game board that makes the NES more powerful), things like vertical scrolling and improved sound make it stand out compared to other NES games. The challenge curve is perfect, with enemies doing double damage once you actually make it to Dracula's castle. There are three assistants that can help as well, and they each offer something that will help make certain problematic areas or bosses easier to bear.

Also, here is some information that fans of the series and newcomers might want to take note of for Castlevania III:

-Since it uses the special MMC5 mapper, this game has problems running on portable or ""retroconsole"" remade systems. And even if it does run, there might be graphical or sound issues. So your best bet is to get a hold of an actual NES.
-There are a lot of differences between this version of the game and the japanese version akumajo densetsu. For example in the dracula stages the damage is never doubled and the final boss is easier. Additionally the help character grant was changed substantially for this version, arguably making him much less useful since in akumajo densetsu he had infinite daggers to throw but no melee attack. More importantly the sound of the entire game is different (which one is better is up to opinion, look it up on youtube if you want to hear the differnce). Unfortunately it is a pain to get the Japanese version working as it was intended, since if you get pin converter and play the game on your NES you will be missing the special sound. The only way to get it running properly on actual hardware is to have a Famicom or to open up and mod your NES.

Regardless of all the complications, both versions are a lot of fun and I personally enjoy the North American copy more. But if you are a die-hard Castlevania fan or really enjoy the game, there is more to be had.",5.0

"There are not many fighters on the Xbox One compared to its competition, and I hope that the situation will improve in the future.  In the meantime, we have the second-to-latest installment to the Blazblue series, made by the same team responsible to the Guilty Gear franchise.  Even though it is not the latest installment anymore, it is still a refined experience.  Maybe it could be the last game that feature full English voice casting, as the sequel is only in Japanese.

There are two sides of the game: the fighting and the story.  The fighting is the typical style you get these days from Japan that's not Street Fighter or Tekken.  There are almost 30 characters to play, each varied in both appearance and fighting style.  If you're new to fighting games, try stylish mode, aka easy combo mode.  Online mode is not very populated, but you should find some players hanging around in lobbies for now.

The story mode is a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BlazBlue-Continuum-Shift-EXTEND-Limited-Edition-Xbox-360/dp/B006VB2V7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND Limited Edition - Xbox 360</a>.  If you want the whole story from the beginning, I'd suggest you play that one first.  The story mode is highly detailed and plays similar to a visual novel with some matches in between.  There are a bunch of side stories and gags in addition.  Warning: if you're just starting the series, you probably won't get the drive behind each character and their motivation.

As it seems unlikely we'll get any new Blazblue games on the Xbox, I highly suggest you play this one.",5.0

"I got it for the tempered protector, not the back. Covers the whole area edge to edge. So don't install it with some buffer room thinking it won't go edge to edge. You'll end up with part of the protector covering non-screen area.

No bubbles, went on great. If you try really hard you'll see the edges very slightly don't adhere. Literal like a hairline at the right angle when the light catches it, which it never does. This is probably because the product has sat at Amazon for a while and the adhesive may have warped at the edges over time with temperature fluctuation in storage or even travel if your state is hot. But don't let this worry you, it's nearly impossible to see.

The back plastic works fine but it's a pain to install. I put it on just to have protection but it's poorly aligned and I definitely got some dust under it. Not a fault of the Gam3Gear. The Vita just has that odd back shape. I would recommend just getting a skin from Amazon or anywhere else to put on the back if you want protection without the hassle of applying thin clear plastic.",5.0

This game is a MUST buy for strategy fans!  This game is gorgeous!  I can't believe I never heard of this before I started searching for PS3 exclusives.  I give SEGA a good round of applause for this game.

I only played the demo and I was SOLD.  The characters are beautifully crafted, the style of play is awesome.  My first thoughts before playing this game was: Man is this going to be another Advance Wars with upgraded graphics?

This game is like a fusion between: Advance Wars, Fallout 3, and .  The way you are immersed in a semi real time battle keeps this game a whole lot more exciting.

I am so glad I tried the demo out... this is surely the next game on my list to pick up!

My advice... if your not sure about spending the money... download the demo and give it a try... it is AWESOME!

"While Anthology was a good collection, offering two classic games with extras, the overall transfered data was horrendous, providing slowdown and lesser versions of the music. Chronicles is a direct transfer as well, but it's a HUGE improvement.
You are able to play two amazing games, FFIV and Chrono Trigger. Both are equally great, but what surprised me most was the fresh approach to Chrono Trigger. Fans with the soundtrack will notice that Triggers music has been re-arranged, and though very similar to its original version, the overall effect creates a much more dramatic feeling when used. Certain songs have been improved, while others are almost identical to their original versions.
IV is the same music, just without the echo effect used in SNES's II version. IV has literally slowdown while Triggers unfortunatley does. Saying that, it doesn't dampen the gameplay at all.
If you don't have these two title on SNES already, get Chronicles. It's a great addition to your library!",5.0

"This game has the most real combat system that I have ever seen the controls are very easy to use and make sense for once. The gundams die I little slow in comparison to the show (the beam sword does not do enough damage.) The story is one of the most brilliant I have EVER SEEN. The story edits it's self to your skill and what you accomplish. This means that it will be just as challenging to a very good player as a very bad player. The gundams get repairs and get damage, they heal as you beat or loss different levels, and there are over 100 level s in an endless amount of combinations. In other words you can play this game over and over and it will never be the same! There is also a very good multiplayer system that is great for when you have friends over and want to play some GUMDAM WING! Also on the sides of the screen (if you are good enough to use it) there is a incoming fire warning that can help you dodge attacks that you can not see! If there is a disadvantage to this game it is the fact that the gundams can turn intently witch makes going behind almost pointless. This can get very annoying if you are like me and in the other games like to strafe up and slash them from behind. This game is a great buy and NEVER GETS OLD.

"Klonoa for the Nintendo Wii is one of the best games I've played in the past five years, especially for the price.  The gameplay is simple but awesome. Yes you only push one button to jump and another button to attach and launch enemies, but the developers somehow took this simple concept and gave it remarkable depth, making the game feel almost like a puzzle game at moments.

The graphics are colorful, quirky, and very well done for a Wii title.  The music fits well, the character designs are delightfully cartoony, and the voices for both the English and Phantomile tracks are very fitting.  Finally there's the story, while I wouldn't call it a shakespearian masterpiece the story of Klonoa did actually manage to elicit an emotional response out of me at several points.  There are moments of the story that do feel a little fudged of course, but the fact that this game manages to tug at my heart strings at all after all these years says a lot!

The title can be a bit easy near the beginning and could have been a little longer, but at a thirty dollar price tag both of these faults are more than acceptable.

So all in all I would immediately recommend this game.  If you enjoy platformers, love cute and quirky games, have children or are merely a child at heart, you're going to love this title!",5.0
"This is my first console since the original x-box.  I chose this for its networking purposes and its great if found my server and all of my music and movies.  Its quiet and it does not run near as hot as the gen 1 PS3.  The remote is great since it replaced our blue-ray player.  the kids love the games.  I thought it would feel cheap with the slide open but I kind of like it, you do need additional space to load the movies but you don't have to worry about the loader breaking ( I have friends that the loader broke)  Its easy to upgrade hard drives, really easy, just YouTube it.  You can get the OS right from Sony for the new hard drive.  I went from 250 to 500.  Don't use an SSD I hear the BUS is too slow to handle it.  I went to a 7200 rpm and its slightly faster but I did it for the increased storage.

"While I'm not certain if its possible to love and hate something at the same time, I am sure that you can be draw to an object and thoroughly repulsed by it in the same breath. I say that because that's how I often feel about this game and its barrages of endless enemies, its boards that fill like mazes with clutter, and its array of weaponry that you have to have to make it through levels. Here, dying is not an option because demise lets you continue only in a proverbial hornets nest with only the most bareboned of essential, sometimes feeding you a power-up for your weaponry and sometimes not. In fact, with many of the horrors it asks you mind to master, it oftentimes sends you reeling through a maze of sensations much akin to driving in a tornado, knowing all the while that there can be no mistakes. Therein lies the potential of frustration, leading you to lock the game away from both your mind and your console. Still, even after the game is set aside and the anger swells, I want to go back and beat it.
Contained here are two relatively similar versions of Gradius, both handling like the first Gradius release of yore. In fact, many things are quite the same, except the fact that there are even more obstacles blocking your paths and there are increased graphics on one of the two portions of the Gradius 3/Gradius 4 puzzle. You still work off the power-up items, finding different colored enemies to shoot that allow you to pick through a small list of items, and you still have to fight monstrosities at the end of each board. So, if you are a fan of 2-D games, then this would be something to at least try out. If you're a fan of the original Gradius, then its a must.

"this game is great. i loved it on the 360 and i wanted to get back into the modding community that i enjoyed with GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andres. my only complaints are the amount of BS i had to go through just to get to play the game. i was seriously about ready to just throw it away, not cause the game is bad, but cause of the Rockstar Lounge crap and Microsoft's PC version of XBL. it was literary an hour of crap and failed updates and errors just to get to play the game, only to find out i couldn't save till i did everything both Microsoft and Rockstar wanted(linking or creating an Live account). when i finally got past all of that, i got an update that specifically removed all that BS, and made it easy to play the game without 20 minutes of crap and sign in stuff. other than that, if you want to do any kind of modding, you need to get a file or 2 and then your ready to go. 5 stars for a great, with a serious hindrance you only have to deal with once",5.0

"Hey all this is Sam AKA Para in the gaming review community. This is one of many gaming reviews I will be starting for Amazon, so I hope you enjoy. Going to be talking about LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet GOTY Edition and what I think is a SUPER AWESOME game. First off let's talk about the story which I have to say is fun and funny at the same time. It is so enjoyable to lay solo but with friends it is just so much more fun. The cut scenes are just hilarious at times and you are always wondering what they will think of next. It is just a well written story that is fun to play and see how it unfolds.

Now for the gameplay, it was nice visually and audio wise. I just love the customization of each sack boy/girl. The way they implemented the motion control if neat, love doing the pelvic thrust LOL. The controls are so simple and could be learned while playing in minutes. As far as graphics go it is just superb. It is simple yet so detailed for a side scrolling game in a 3d world. You will be amazed at how the fire looks and just the overall stitching of your sack boy/girl. They look so real that you feel like that is your little pet and you don't want him to die in the fire or electric lol. Also the audio sound effects are a blast. Fire sounds real, the sack person getting burned is so funny and when they touch electric and pop, hilarious. There is just so much to do in this game that it will keep you playing and playing. With the game creation tools you will have endless gameplay here. I will talk more about that in the online/multiplayer section, which is next.

Now for online/multiplayer which I can say is fun, let me rephrase that, it is over the top enjoyable and will have you playing for hours and not even know it. Playing with friends is so fun and funny that you will want to slap your friend over and over, I mean in the game not for real HAHA. Yes you can actually move the sack persons hands too and slap friends to the floor, wave to them, or even give them the finger.......well not that part but it is still funny. Online is a bit laggy though at times and getting into a game sometimes sticks because it might throw you in a game that is finishing or finished. Don't let the frighten you though, if you get a good connection to a game stick with those players cause it will be fun. Now for the creating, creating your own level is easy, there is a nice tutorial that is very helpful and will teach you the basics with some advanced stuff to. But it really all comes to your imagination. There are so many fun levels to play from Mario recreations to Music songs which is just mind blowing of how these players create this stuff. They really have made a game that has so much replay value and it is great to see the gaming community taking part in this. Also they have some fun add-ons like the Metal Gear Solid with the paint gun, which is a blast, literally.

The added content of the GOTY edition is a nice touch for the price and saves you some money.

Overall Sony/MM has done a great job on the game and it will be played for years to come.

Score out of 5

Concept/Story: 5*, So fun and funny you will keep playing over and over trying to collect everything from the levels and figuring out new ways to complete the level.

Graphics: 5*, For a side scrolling game with 3d implications this is the best. Everything has high details and you will think that sometimes you can see the strip of your sack person coming off after a bad death lol. Also the camera angles are so well placed that it makes the game much easier to play.

Sound: 5*, With great graphics you must have great sound effects and they have pulled it off flawlessly.

Entertainment Value: 5*, Fun with friends and even solo. I have to say though more enjoyable with friends and just having a good time goofing off.

Control: 5*, Not really hard to learn.

Replay Value: 5*, Playing with friends just makes this game so replayable but being able to create your own levels or play community levels makes this game endless for replay value.

Thank you for your time, hope this review helps with your decision to buy the game. Take my word or don't take it, but this is a game you will be happy with purchasing.",5.0

"As a long time Guilty Gear fan and a Nintendo DS owner and lover, I gotta say... Guilty Gear Dust Strikers is one of the best fighting games for the DS. Just as Guilty Gear X2 #Reload has graced my laptop (GOG, $6) with great fighting game gameplay, GGDS has graced my DS with a unique spin on both the GG series and the fighting game genre. I'd place GGDS right up there with Ultimate Mortal Kombat and Bleach Dark Souls -both of which I own.

Guilty Gear Dust Strikers plays like a cross between Guilty Gear and, Nintendo's much venerated, Smash Bros games. Up to four (4) people can play at once and the stages are multi-tiered. You can face away from your opponent(s) in order to flat out escape their attacks but, for those who are more accustomed to simply blocking, that mechanic may prove frustrating. The ability to jump up to or down to a different tier is also an effective means of dodging an attack.

Another commonality that GGDS shares with Smash Bros is the different mini-games sprinkled throughout the main game. Some mini-games incorporate that touch-screen in some simple but challenging ways. The mini-games are offered in the story and arcade modes.

All-in-all, Guilty Gear Dust strikers is one of those fun and unique games that really does make a Nintendo DS worth owning. Its diverse modes, Smash Bros fighting mechanics, and just the familiar-fan-fav characters themselves make it worth checking out. Better still, GGDS is worth owning.",5.0

I prefer a slightly lighter mouse, but I'm getting used to this.

edit after about 1 month: it's started having the double click issue already, but maybe because I got a refurbished one. I fixed it by opening small clicker box and adjusting the spring, you can see tutorials online for it.",5.0

"Looking at this it is very hard to say this is just a game controller as game controllers are purely about function.  There is a lot more then function going on here.  The detail of the wood neck, inlayed fret board and workmanship sets this apart by a long shot.  The feel both weight and balance are much more guitar and not controler.  One could knock it for not being compatible but in order to be compatible MTV games would have to publish its property interface for Rockband which clearly they have not done yet.  I can hardly put that one on Logitech.

Pro:
Weight and balance of a real guitar
Beautiful
Controls very responsive
Worked out the box with no instructions needed

Con:
Expensive

"It works great so far.  At first I was having trouble because it seemed like it was not turning no.  Well I was using the new batteries in new wii remotes that I bought, a pink and teal one.  Well they wouldn't turn on or blink when I pressed buttons except for 1 and 2 hold together, which is for one time sync.  Thats when it hit me that you have to sync the remotes.  I forgot about that because I stopped playing the wii a lot over the last 2 years, but have just recently gotten back into it.  Anyways, if it is already synced, you will have no problems.  Otherwise you have to have the standard batteries to sync them first and then change to the battery pack.  So far works great.  I'll update my review in two week to see how it lasts after some heavy usage.",5.0
"I've been Tales of Series games for a long time, This is my fifth Tales of game I've played.

This game got what all the other games has, an anime styled story that makes you feel like you're watching and involved in an anime styled movie.  You play as Yuri Lowell who is a former knight of the Empire.  Yuri not one of these lawful heroes either he plays the antihero that doesn't mind breaking the law for the greater good.

I love how you learn your skills on this game, You learn them by equiping your weapons, your weapons will have usually three skills that can be learned by using the weapon for an x amount of battles.

I also love they have an archer again.  Last few Tales of games have not had an Archer class character.  So I love having one on this one.

The game's humor is where it always is with Tales of games.  You have the hothead Rita who will punch you in the face if you make her mad, you have the super sweet and naive Estelle, you have the perverted Raven the Great who always getting rejected it.  The scary cat Karol who probably scared of his own shadow.

This is one of the best rpgs on the 360.  If you're a fan of Tales of you'll love it but, if you never played one this would be a great Tales of Game to get know what Tales of is all about.",5.0

"this game is absolutely Beautiful...and not because of the Fighting alone..but because of the Excellently done Career Mode. it is simular to Def Jam Icon or the Superstar mode in Madden. it makes you WANTT to progress through the game just to see what happens next...as you choose rather to train or spend time doing various other recreational activites with other friends or girlfriends...and the storyline really does keep you immersed in it...as becoming the champion is not the end of your journey. it really does feel like a Boxing Career.

as far as the Boxing itself, it flows Well. it can be somewhat Slow at times..but doesnt ruin the experience of the game much at all. once you find what punches work for you and start to put together combinations, they really do flow beautifully and do appropriate damage. this is in no way an Arcade boxing game, youv got to box strategicly if you want to win...as button mashing will get you KO'd. i play the game on the easiest mode, as i hate having to be beaten and repeat fights over and over..but there is still a relevant challenge from the cpu. the Knockouts are just as good as those seen in Fight Night 3..but the fighting is wayy more Fluent than fight nights. online is fun as well...theres no lagg or slowdown to speak of.

overall, pick up this game if you love boxing and love a good Storyline, you won't be dissapointed at all, i am glad i gave it a chance..

"Wasn't quite sure what I was getting when I ordered this, but the gameplay is addicting, if not repetive, and the fun factor is high.  Great workout in this since you can choose what level you want when you get setup and each day you never know what exercises you'll get.  The ducking/weaving combos can be a little finicky sometimes as the movements aren't always picked up even when you do them, but the workout is really quality.  I always feel like I managed to get a solid routine in even if I only played for fifteen minutes.

The tutorials are easy, if not always about proper form.  It took me a few weeks to really start getting those uppercuts and hooks timed right along with the proper form, but that didn't take away from the overall fun of the game.  Great for anyone who's looking for a change from the normal Active/Wii Fit workout.  Boxing is one of my favorite things in both of those games and I love this one since the ducking/weaving add to the leg workout.

Recommended for anyone who's looking for a great workout game.",5.0

"A lot of reviewers have compared&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Smash-Up/dp/B001VJ843O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>, and I think the comparison is pretty good. The gameplay feels a lot like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>, even going so far as incorporating strong ""A button"" moves. I think if you like Smash and want more,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Smash-Up/dp/B001VJ843O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up</a>&nbsp;would be a good addition.

A lot of reviewers have criticized this game for not having a lot of characters. I think there's some truth to that, but not a whole lot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Smash-Up/dp/B001VJ843O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up</a>&nbsp;does have fewer characters initially, but there are at least 10 secret characters. Some of these have been revealed online, but a few haven't (if you look at the game website, you'll see at least 6 question marks for additional secret characters). I have no idea if these secret characters are going to be exciting additions, like Leatherhead but it's too early to tell.

Also, let's remember that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>&nbsp;had more characters, but less than half were even decent and most were lousy. Whenever I played with my friends, we tended to only use about 3 characters each. Frankly, adding a bunch of Jigglypuffs to the character roster did not really do much for me. By contrast, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Smash-Up/dp/B001VJ843O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up</a>, I get the sense that most of the characters are roughly equivalent and good to play with.

This game also has a few innovations not seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>. I like the stages a lot better. More room to fight, as well as more interaction between the stage and the characters. In one stage, a giant alligator will eat your character if you're not careful. Also, the characters can hang onto walls.

At the end of the day, is this game as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Smash-Bros-Brawl/dp/B000FQ9R4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>? Probably not. Smash was a unique game. However,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-Smash-Up/dp/B001VJ843O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash Up</a>&nbsp;is fun in its own right and worth trying if you want more Smash-style playing or different characters.",5.0

"I almost passed this game up. I kept reading about the beautiful graphics before it was released. I tend to be let down by a lot of RPG's lately. I am a big fan of the Tactics style RPG's but even those are getting old because it's the same thing over and over. I decided to download Valkyria Chronicles demo when it was put on the Playstation store. I just wanted to check out the bragged about graphics and figured it was just another great looking RPG with a lame story and poor battle system. I couldn't have been more wrong. In the demo you get to play a tutorial and a skirmish.....that's all I needed and I preordered the game right away. Its hard to describe what genre this game is, could be called a tactics live action role playing game I guess. I am sure there are a lot of reviews that tell about the game play so I won't get into that. I will point out my favorite and not so favorite parts. I really like how they make all the characters unique people. There are the main characters, but even the soldiers are their own person and not just nameless, faceless extras. Each person has strengths and weaknesses that makes the game that much better. Some people have desert allergy so you can't use them effectively in sandy conditions where other are country or city bred so they shine even more when in their element. That was a nice twist to add onto the game. Some things that I don't care for is this game is very story happy...meaning you watch story clip after story clip before you get to play a battle. At points the story can get childish (Hans the pig) and the acting at times is a little blah....this is war and sometimes it seems like its no big deal to the characters as they all seem in a good mood all the time even though their homeland was just invaded and they are fighting for their lives. It would have been nice to have it a little darker of story telling. With that said, the game play more than makes up for it and it's a top rated game all the way. A single battle can take an hour, even 2 hours as my first boss battle lasted just last night. I am not sure the length of the game, from what I have been reading about chapter numbers it seems like I am about 1/2 done and it seems like I just started so it might be a little on the short side. The game does seem to have a lot of replay value though and I will most likely play through it again to get higher rankings than I have been. Because of the prices of games now I tend to buy very few but for any tactics rpg fan, I think you will really love this game and it would be a must buy.",5.0
"So this is basically my new favorite controller.  Feels great in the hands with a good grip and find that my hands don't sweat at all with this controller (Also I have XL sized hands).  The button response is the best of any controller I have yet used, of course it is wired, but even out of the wired controllers I have used, this beats them all.  Very quick pushes and not noisy either.  Great work on the hardware by increasing the responsiveness but not the noise levels.  The programmable buttons on the back of the controller can be a little clicky/loud but it isn't too bad, plus the sound since it is on the backside of the controller is directed away from you so it isn't disturbing.  Hair trigger settings work great as well I have had no issues at all with my use.  The built in audio is decent but every now and then the controller would freeze unless I disconnected my headset from the controller.  This problem is sporadic and I cant seem to nail down why it happens, so until then I am just using a wireless headset, no problems with freezing at all.  Others I have seen have complained about button assignment issues, I have had zero issues.  If I do have any I will be sure to update this review with them.  I know people also have complained about the customer service provided by Razer, I have never had to deal with them, and so I cant speak to their level of care.  I do hope there will be some sort of firmware update to fix the freezing with the headsets, otherwise, I love the controller and use it all the time now.",5.0

Excellent gaming keyboard for those that don't desire mechanical keys. The blue LED is the correct color blue to match other items such as case fans.

"It's easy - there is and probably will be for a long time no other on line game that offers a WWII simulation on a tactical/strategical level in a persistant world where the war takes place 24/24 .
It is not blue against red like Counterstrike or 1942 .
It is not Quake and it is not any other mindless shooter .
It is a war with historical material both on land and in the air (Char B1 bis , Bofors  , Spitfire , Me 109 , Panzer 38 , Sturmegschutz III , 88mm Flak and dozens more) and taking place on a huge map covering Europe from the Alps to GB and from Germany to Paris .
Scale is 1/2 and the geography is accurate .
However to enjoy this unique game , you need what it takes - namely patience and organisation .
Patience because to mount an attack that succeeds it is needed to gather forces , transport infantery , set up artillery , get the planes on CAP above target , prepare bomber flights .
It takes time and people who want to rush to an immediate action and begin shooting are only rewarded by immediate death .
But people who have the patience are rewarded by an extraordinary sense of accomplishment .
Organisation because this game is a real time simulation of big scale warfare .
It matters what happens on every place of the front and an efficient chain of command with skilled officers and disciplined units is the condition for victory .
It doesn't matter if Joe Quaker gets 10 times more kills than Bill Striker , what matters is teamwork and a good thinker is 10 times worth a good sniper .
For that reason also , it is almost mandatory to belong to a good well organised squad to enjoy the game at its highest level .
There is place for lone wolves too but they almost only get the action part of the game .
So if you have what it takes , WWIIOL is most definitely one of the best games for you .

"This game is without a doubt one of the best games ever made, and what a DEAL at 19.99 for the whole set! This game's single player is very enjoyable, and you'll also enjoy countless hours of free online play (provided you have a decent internet connection).

Blizzard's free online gaming service is fantastic.  Simple and easy to use, and it has everything from competitive 1vs1ing as well as team games of sizes anywhere from 2vs2 to 4vs4, massive 8-way free for alls and more!  I really enjoy playing this online with my friends.

If you like real time strategy games, this is a must have.  I'd also like to say that of all the games I've played so far by this company, I've never been disappointed.  They're all high quality in my opinion, and Starcraft is certainly no exception.",5.0
"Okay confession time. I love games with nice, cute, engrossing story lines and beautiful art. This game definitely has that and more. i would describe this game as light, fun and sweet. Although it does have its occasional philosophical moments. That being said it is not a difficult game. So, tp those hard core rpg players looking for a game that requires over 100 hours and some serious level grinding this may not be your cup of tea. You will find  however, what I think is a very inventive light/dark moves battle system though. I also thought the whole dream world and Chopin on his death bed thing was a very interesting premise. I was happy that at least to the other characters it was real life and things mattered and had consequences for them.
The soundtrack was amazing! I won't pretend and say I knew a lot of Chopin's work because I didn't. In fact, I think I knew about three of his songs before this game but now I definitely know some of his best work. During interludes at the game loading screen they do tell you about the historical significance of some of the music and about Chopin himself. I found it quite interesting although some might find the mini history lesson off putting. Overall I love this game and personally it's the most fun I've had on the PS3.",5.0

"This is my very first foray into the Lego video games. I actually had bought the Indiana Jones and Star Wars itinerations for the PS3, but never even got to open the packages, let alone played them. I eventually gave them to my cousin, bypassing them for something childish.

When the PS4 came out, the truth is the launch game line-up was rather underwhelming. I bought AC: Black Flag, FIFA 14, and Killzone. They were great games, but they just lacked something, something lightheartedly FUN.

So when this game went on sale for $40, I bought it just for the heck of it, but also with help from all the 5 -star reviews here on Amazon. I'm glad I did.

First of all, the character set is HUGE. I mean, you can discover and play up to 100 characters - where have you even heard of anything like this before?? I mean Mortal Kombat got a little ridiculous after a while, but this is just RIDONKULOUS.

The storyline and writing are also very well done, with lots of adult references, and little digs here and there for the movie versions, as well as each other's backstories.

The voice acting is also excellent. I was a bit disappointed to not have Robert Downey Jr. be associated with Ironman, etc., but actually as the story wears on, I got used to the new voices, and I even actually really like them, and I bet you will too.

The Lego games are never known for their graphical prowess, so you would think on the PS4 it would be a waste. But it actually works quite well, with lots and lots of elements onscreen, all flowing very smoothly at 1080p(like the Sandman stage).

All-in-all, with all the adult humor and references and innuendos, this makes for a great game for kids and adults alike. If you want a quick fun session to relieve some stress(Hulk is intensely satisfying just walking around and bashing everything in sight), and have pure lighthearted fun, this is the only current game on the PS4 that meets all the criteria.

Highly Recommended!",5.0

"This keyboard was purchased for a home theater PC and works exceptionally well considering the cost and user-intended use.  The battery life is respectable, the unit is of passable build quality, and the reception range and signal reliability are impressive.  All this with a built-in touchpad.

You may ask why did I choose a PS3 keyboard for a PC?
- Bluetooth keyboards on PC's are rather expensive and more so when you are looking for a built-in touchpad.
- Few choices of products when searching for keyboard+touchpad combos
- Logitech makes the DiNovo Mini and Edge but these are rather expensive - and they have their issues.
- Wireless keyboard/mouse combos (non-Bluetooth) are notoriously short on reception range and unreliable (missed keystrokes)

The PS3 keyboard is fully functional with a PC and half the price of other alternatives (that are of unknown vendors and trash quality)

The highlights of the keyboard are:
- Value (contrasted to similar Bluetooth keyboard + touchpad sets)
- Bluetooth support (range, reliability)
- Touchpad (same as a laptop touchpad)
- Keyboard-based left and right mouse buttons on both sides of the keyboard (perfect for true ""laptop"" use)
- Touchpad-based scrolling
- Lightweight
- Acceptable build quality
- Acceptable battery life
- Software support is absolutely basic (No bloatware, Windows 7 does support this product)

The cons:
- Designed for a PS3 (No windows key but you can just use Ctrl+Esc)
- No backlighting (for use in low-light)
- Gloss plastic (fingerprints)
- Software support is absolutely basic (Might be an issue for some)
- Unknown if it can survive a drop to a hardwood floor (and I'm not going to test this out)
- Unit does not appear to shut off automatically
- Weak documentation (use standard Bluetooth procedures to install the unit)

Just be sure to pick up a reliable Bluetooth transmitter (""dongle"").",5.0

"My personal experience with the PS4 streaming from about 30 feet away over a wireless connection was fantastic. Again, it is wireless and there's SOME latency, but I don't even notice when playing games like Diablo 3 or Far Cry 4. Playing online twitch shooters isn't ideal over stream, but pretty much any single player/co op  experience works awesome.

As far as the Vita games are concerned, they look awesome on the big screen. Not ALL Vita games are available yet, but there is a feature using the R3 and L3 inputs to substitute for the lack of front and back touch screens on the dual shocks. So in time, there's no reason for most all Vita games to work.

But if neither of those features interest you, maybe the classics library of PSone and PSP games on a console that costs $79.99 that can stream movies and tv shows will. Hopefully Netflix is available soon.",5.0

"Bought this together with the rudders and throttle after many months of research.  I'd previously had Thrustmaster F16 FLQS and F16 TQS and the FLQS had lost accuracy very quickly and didn't impress, so I wasn't in a hurry to buy the Cougar.  I'd had a CH Flightstick years ago and still remembered that as a solid, no-nonsense controller that worked everytime.

The new generation of CH Products is just as good.  This stick will last for a very long time, is solidly constructed and easy to program (just press the button on the controller and enter the key that you want to assign to it).

I haven't fully exploited the capabilities yet - as with all of these HOTAS sticks, it takes some time working out what you want to assign to each button.  Perhaps some pre-supplied maps would have been nice.",5.0

"Before playing this game, I had no idea of the story I would get to encounter. In it, you play a survivor of a plane crash who also happens to find by some strange stroke of luck an underground city called Rapture lying deep down the Atlantic Ocean. The first minutes of the game are just simply amazing and frightening as you try to make sense of what is going on. One of the most frightening moment is when you enter and encounter face to face the founder of the city as he talks to you for the first time. Personally this was one of the many goosebumps I got. But the most frightening is in the surgery room when you find some tonic, you look behind you and then...

From the start, the atmosphere immerses you into the game, from the creepy fifties' music to the spooky and morbid lighting around this strange ghost town and the very impressive voice acting to the animation of the character's which are excellent. Loved the powers that you get during the game, especially the telekinesis and the one with the bees. Though you never are to sure of what your character really looks like, if you are very careful, just before you get to meet Andrew Ryan, the founder of Rapture, you get to see photos of you and also learn a shocking revelation.

Happy to see that the public responded well to this game, which was not the case for certain masterpieces like Beyond Good and Evil which got great reviews, but not enough attention from the public for it was released between prince of Persia, The sands of Time and another Tom Clancy's game whose name I forget. I am happy to see that the sequel Bioshock 2 is out and I hope it will be awesome.",5.0

"As of now, I am still unable to use this headset because I cannot, so far, get the Corsair program to install on my Windows XP computer.  I have searched the box the headset came in and no where on it does it give any systems operating requirements. I have tried installing it via my WinRar program and though I get the black Corsair icon, when I click on it absolutely nothing happens.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled it two times and am now downloading another compression program from FileHippo.  I will update this review when I have determined that I can or cannot use them.

As far as the headset itself, it is a bit large for  my head even when adjusted to the smallest setting. I am female and they are not as secure as other gaming headsets that I have used.  These are better for people with larger sized heads.  The earcups are soft and the seem to be well constructed.

I re-downloaded the Corsair program again and installed it via WinZip. I have the icon in my tray, but it will not open.  I give up.  I can't review the audio quality of this headset if I can't use it.

UPDATE: 11.10/14 -  I finally did get the program to install, however it won't do a thing. With the headset and antenna paired and turned on, I can click on volume on the program and nothing happens. Definitely not for Windows XP.

UPDATE: 9.28.15 - It's been a long time and I meant to update this review some time ago.  I'd like to report that these work great with my windows 8.1 pc and I think they are quite good.  I have upgraded the star level to 5.",5.0

"Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the movie Tron: Legacy very much. Great story, soundtrack and world design. However it didn't feel like Tron so much as a futuristic world set in neon. If you really want to get the ""user digitized inside a computer"" experience Tron 2.0 is where it's at. It's set like a sequel to the movie with the dude who wrote the original Tron program, Alan (Bruce Boxleitner), gets captures into the computer world and it's up to his son Jet to get him out. From there you get an amazing first person shooter game that looks like no other.

This game's absolute biggest claim to fame is the look and feel of the digitized world. If you ever saw the original Tron movie and loved seeing that universe that was created then that alone is enough to play this game. The setting is simply fantastic. From the neon lighting (all over the place!) to the geometric landscapes. This game just oozes the atmosphere of the movie, only to a much more heightened level. Monolith developed the game using it's latest Lithtech engine at that time. That engine really knew how to maximize the use of lighting to great effect. The music was also very reminiscent of the original movie, with an analog and mathematical feel to it while still sounding melodic and ambient.

Gameplay is pretty linear, which is standard far for most FPS games. As far as weapons are concerned you start with the iconic ID disc, now updated to look much cooler than just being a frizbie with lines. From there you can accumulate ""upgrades"" to get your standard shotgun, sniper rifle and autofiring rifle. I still found that most of the time your disc works best, but the other weapons do become pretty useful. Weapons aren't the only upgrades you get. Jet can upgrade himself to Jet 1.1 and so on. With these upgrades he can add subroutines of varying levels (Alpha, Beta and Gold similar software releases these days). This makes for an RPG type experience leveling up your player.

What makes the game really fun is that there are lots of references relating to computers, and you can see just how they interact in this computer world. The names of other programs (NPCs) have extensions like .exe, and .dll. The more nasty opponents are viruses that can much up the environment as well as your health. Jet would have to defragment or repair infected subroutines when that happens. There is also one level where you have to outrun a disk format, which is portrayed as this invincible wall destroying everything as it moves closer. If you have any experience with working on a computer in a more in depth level there is lots of little details to enjoy here.

Another feather in the game's cap was the return of talents from the original Tron movie. Bruce Boxleitner and Cindy Morgan handle voice characterizations with Bruce reprising his role as Alan Bradley. Sid Mead, the conceptual designer for the original, did several sketches for the light cycle back in the day. With Tron 2.0 you get to see one of his original designs come to life in the most spectacular way (and you get to ride this original, yet new, light cycle). Did I forget to mention that? You get to ride two kinds of light cycles (both new and old) in a classic ""don't hit the jet walls"" match.

According to the creator of the original Tron, Steven Lisberger, Tron 2.0 is an official sequel to the 1982 film. Then Tron: Legacy came out and made things confusing on the ""official"" front. Still this game is much truer to the original material than the movie. If you loved the old movie you will absolutely go ape for this game. If you liked the aesthetics of either of the Tron movies this game will really impress you visually. Game play is fun as well so get yourself a copy.",5.0

"The PowerA dual charger for the Playstation 4 controller had the best reviews, so I went with it. I have used it for a few days now, and it has not disappointed.

This was the bundle version that came with a USB charging cable. A great addition to the one that came with the PS4, as I was worry that it may break on me one day. The cord is also good for when you still want to continue playing if your charger happens to die.

Some reviewers have complained about the charger feeling too cheap and lightweight. I agree, it is very lightweight and could be heavier, but I think it still gets the job done. It sits perfectly on a flat surface and you just have to push down to pop the controllers in or out. The dock barely moves.

Some reviews have mentioned it being hard to place the controller into place. I had a little difficulty at first, but once I understood how it worked, I had no problem at all. It snaps in with the perfect fit.

There is also a single charging dock version of this, but I have seen many issues with that one. Definitely get the dual one if you plan on buying.

As for indications of charging being complete, there is no LED light on the dock itself, but the controllers act as the indication. The DS4 controllers light up when charging and completely turn off when it's finished.

Lastly, I have not owned this for long, so I cannot speak on whether it will die, stop giving a charge, or make the controller last shorter times. Will update if any issues come up.

The only reason you would choose another charger for controllers is aesthetics. Maybe you prefer another way the controllers look when sitting on the dock for display. Otherwise, I still think this looks pretty cool.",5.0
"I am pleased to provide a review of this gaming headset. I was provided a discounted unit in return for my honest review. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Connection:
This headset has two plugs. One for Audio, one for the Mic. When connecting to a PC with sound card it is flawless and easy. I connected it to a docking station for my laptop which has both plus as well. In addition, I tested with a laptop and an Xbox as well. In order to connect to my laptop and Xbox and use the Mic I needed an adapter to convert the two plugs to a single one. This would be a nice addition to add in the box.

Size & Fit:
The headset was very comfortable and easily adjusts to my head and my sons. It is firm to slide into position and easily stays there.

Look:
They are a great looking headset.

Sound:
I am not an audiophile expert but I have found these to sound good. Because these are over the ear headphones the can function as noise reducing headphones. The Mic has a flexible portion which you can bend to the position you want it in. I was told I came through clear on the other end. There are good sounds at all ranges of the spectrum in my experience

Pros:
Packagaing - the packaging has a very cool look
Cost - It is a good price for the quality
Sound  very clear with decent bass
Mic  Flexible Mic

Suggestions:
The only thing I would recommend is for these to include the adapter so can be used with laptops and gaming consoles with only a single plug.

Overall:
I am pleased with these headphones and would recommend these as a good sounding, gaming headset with long lasting comfort. This is my first headset from Unistone but I happy with them and would recommend them and if their other products are of comparable quality I would recommend them as a company.",5.0

"When it comes down to it, everybody wants a video game system that is just affordable and fun. With Nintendo, they absolutely have delivered with the success of the Wii and the DS. But, last year, they've made a shocking decision to finally end their run with longtim success of the Game Boy franchise after nearly 20 years of success. Still, Nintendo has found a new system that delivers just as well. back in 2004, Nintendo launched the DS, which won a whole new audience of gamers who love the way we use the stylus and innovation of gameplay. Since then, it absolutely has changed the way we play video games on the go. Now, it has once again gone blue, 4 years after the original Nintendo DS release.

The Nintendo DS Lite in Colbalt and Black, is a new way we see the essence of blue, with this blue-colored look of the system, that appeals to boys and the seductive color of girls' eyes too. The system is sleek and easy to play all your favorite Nintendo DS games and also your Game Boy Advance titles like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3 on the go. The system also includes a much longer battery life than the original DS system, and is easy to charge up. The look of the games is even better than the original DS on all your favorite titles like New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs and Brain Age 2. You can also compete against other gamers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection for special titles through a wireless connection with ease. The price is also affordable at $129, unlike those other hard to get systems like the Playstation 3 or the Wii, so anyone who wants to buy a video game system whether it is on a budget, or if you trust the Nintendo brand can get this great system.

All in all, I love the Nintendo DS Lite in Cobalt and Black is a great video game system for gamers of all ages. I absolutely recommend this great handheld system because it is well worth the purchase, and it will keep you gaming for years to come. If you've bought the orignal Nintendo DS or a longtime Game Boy fan and want to trade up, than this is the game system for you.

"I gave the game a high rating because I am a franchise of the game. I own many of the previous games.

Graphics and game play:
The graphics are next gen and look amazing compared to the PS2 versions. The overall game play is dark and ominous. It may be a little too grotesque for younger kids. There is a lot of blood, violence, and sounds that leave a lot to interpretation (mostly when you die by the monsters). There game is not too difficult but is hard to progress further into the game. The game does not provide any hints or indicators, you have to walk around and figure it out on your own.

"I've played all prior Fallout 3 games and this is one of the best so far. The character creation is absolutely wonderful (you get to see your character born), and I love the fact that no matter what race/face you make your dad ends up looking like you.

You're characer has lived her entire life in a fallout shelter. After your dad is forced to leave the vault you pursue him, finding yourself in a land of mutants and mutated creatures.

This game is gripping and easy and just a heck of a lot of fun. It also is pretty violent, and realistic. People die, dogs attack, and life is not so good for the vast portion of humanity. Combat is easy to understand, and I like the fact that they allow you to autotravel and travel without constantly having to depress a single key. Downsides? No real romance or personality to many of these characters. I think it would liven things up to have a spouse in your house back in Megaton besides your trusty robot butler.

5 stars. For mature audiences only. Game contains adult elements not suitable for the kiddies.",5.0
"I have spent many happy nights playing this game. It doesn't get old and new situations are always entertaining you. But, as the reviews for this game have proved, not ALL people enjoy this game.
It is one of those games that people either love or hate.
But if you read the reviews customers have given this game, you can see most bad reviews were based upon the game not working on their computer
My number one advice to you? CHECK OUT THE COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS BEFORE PURCHASING. This game has some odd requirements that your computer may or may not have.
However, if this game does work on your computer, you probably won't be disappointed--I sure wasn't.
It is great fun building the hotel with the furniture and building designs and watching your costumers. Improving your hotel never gets boring.
SO now, I am going to chart it out very simply for you-
**WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME**
*Graphics are fairly good
*It never gets boring and is always fun to build the hotel with the various options it has and furniture it offers.
*Watching the people interact in the hotel environment is fascinating.
*There are several levels that give you a goal to complete.
**WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME**
*It doesn't work on everyone's computer, but if you are smart enough to check out the system requirements, chances are, it will work on your computer.
*You are not into simulation games...If you like the sims, you'll probably like this game as well. It is almost like ""THE SIMS"" except you are fulfilling goals, building a hotel, and magaging it..
To conclude, if it works on your computer and you like simulation games, BUY THIS GAME. You won't be disappointed!",5.0

"When approaching Alan Wake I wasn't really sure what to expect.  I've always been a huge survival horror fan.  I've been fighting off hordes of the undead since the first Resident Evil on PS1 (actually since ""Zombies ate my Neighbors"" on SNES).  I didn't know too much about Alan Wake but I decided to give it a shot anyways.  Boy was I suprised!  This game turned out to be a jewel.  Alan Wake has so much atmosphere you could bottle it up and sell it out of a soda machine.  Some games don't get the pacing right, with too much of this or too much of that.  Alan Wake seems to have pacing perfected (action, exploration, puzzles).  If you're a horror game fan you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.  This game has renewed my love for the XBOX 360.  I just hope they don't take too long to make a full sequel.",5.0
"In its tenure, the N64 had its share of bad games. With exceptions like Super Mario 64, the THQ wrestling games and a few others, it seemed like the bad outweighed the good. But with 'Ocarina of Time', the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game.
'Ocarina of TIme' has many strong points for itself. For one, the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake. The game plays across a vast world with different subsections, each with their own particular themes. The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game. Graphics and sounds are done extremely well, considering the cartridge space allowed.
There is not much to complain about, as this game really showed players what the N64 was capable of. It's unfortunate that other game publishers didn't work this hard. But then again, ""Ocarina"" is a tough act to follow.",5.0
"Bomberman is a game that I have never owned but have played it on many, many occasions. The idea of this one is the go around setting bombs to clear out walls and your enemies in order to find the door to the next level. It is challenging to me, and each level gets more and more difficult. To start out you can only set one bomb at a time, but I think later on you have more power. I am honestly not sure if the classic NES version had two-player head to head play, but even if this version does not include that feature, the game is still very addictive and has great replay value. In my opinion, the price is a little high for this title, but then again it is a small price to pay to have these classic NES titles available to play when and where you want to. I will more than likely buy this one(along with mario, ice climber)at some point, and I suggest the same to anyone out there that enjoys a good puzzle type game or classic NES gameplay in general. It should provide you with a lot of entertainment for a long time.",5.0

"What an absolutely amazing game. I haven't been hooked on a battlefield game since BFBC2. I fricken love that they went back to WW1, playing in a modern/futuristic era is just not my cup of tea. I love that this game is going back to its root: teamwork, using iron sights, battles across massive maps. This game was 110% worth the purchase; the visuals are astonishing, it sounds spectacular, it makes me feel like I'm truly embodying the gruesome aspects of the first world war. There's nothing like watching your friend get charged by a bayonet through the thick fog/mist of the maps.

10/10 would watch my friend get annihilated by a bayonet again while I laugh hysterically.",5.0
"These headphones are outstanding. The sound is described as tournament grade audio and although Im not an expert, the sound quality is excellent to me.  There are many great features to these headphones. Here are a few that stand out for me.

 Impressive, attractive packaging. For example, the instructions come in a folded envelope, nicely packed, like an invitation to game!
 Retractable microphone that isn't in the way when you don't need it
 3 different configurations for use with different types of devices. Swappable cable system with in-line audio controls for use with PC, Mac, tablets, and phones.
 Audio can be customized with downloads from the manufacturers website
 Well-padded headphones that are comfortable and have an appealing look

On the downside, the instructions are mostly photos instead of words to show you how to set-up and use the headphones. Unfortunately, with all the different configurations available, more detailed instructions are needed than what were provided in this short, simple brochure. It wasn't easy to figure out the best way to configure the cables for a specific device. I looked for additional details on the manufacturers website, but ended up relying on advice from a friend with more experience with these this type of headphone.

Although the description for the headphones doesnt mention use with gaming systems, the headphones do work with the PS4 in a limited capacity. The headphone jack can be plugged into the controller and although you don't get the noise-canceling, surround sound experience, you are able to use them for party and game chat when playing online. I highly recommend these high-end headphones, which are comparable to Astro headphones and sound even better than those made by Turtle Beach.",5.0

"This is the first Animal Crossing I've played, so I'm completely new to the franchise. Other than watching the ""Treehouse"" videos and searching out any other marketing material, I was not sure what to expect. But like many others, I eagerly awaited this release. So after playing two and a half days, I feel like I have enough grip on the game to post an honest review.

Basically Animal Crossing is a game that is vaguely similar to games like Harvest Moon. That is a gross oversimplification, and while it's not fair to compare two different games in this manner, it's not hard to say that if you are used to the open-world ""do whatever you want"" types of world that HM brings, you'll probably feel quite comfortable with AC.

I don't want to do a detailed game-play analysis for this review; there are other reviews (and web site) which cover those things. But over a period of roughly 50 hours since I've owned the game, I've logged at least 11 hours in the game, so I would take that as an indication that I am quite enjoying the game. Idle weekends are great to catch up on things like this.",5.0
"This game is a lot of fun. My computer wasn't quite good enough for Sims 3, so I bought this version. Sims 2 is more complex than the original game. I love the fact that characters can grow up. It was annoying that kids in the original game were stuck at one age level forever. I've played Sims 3 on my sister's computer and it is even more complex. So complex, that playing it sometimes seems like too much work. I think that Sims 2 is a good compromise of having many more options than the original Sims, but isn't as hard as Sims 3.",5.0
"Although criticized by others, I absolutely love that Uncharted Golden Abyss scaled down on the scripted action scenes that were present in U2 and U3.  This game actually reminds me a lot more of Uncharted Drakes Fortune, my favorite in the series.  This time, Drake is a lot younger and it has a more explorer-y feel to the game.

I think this is the definitive Vita game to get right now.  It is the best example of what the machine can do.  Highly recommended for anyone with a Vita or if you are a fan of the Uncharted series.",5.0

I also really love the full-size touchpad. It is much better than some of the gimicky-pointer options out there today. Allthough I still love the dual-design of my Microsoft WEK 7000's navigation pad.

"Ok, first off:  I have a 700mhz Processor, 128 RAM, and Voodoo 3000 video 3D accelorator.  The game works great with near maxed graphic settings for me.  If you have less than this, you might want to upgrade before buying the game.
Next: In my oppinion you must get a joystick for this game.  And if you can fork out a few extra dollars for a force feedback one it is Amazingly worth it.  I cannot believe how sweet the game feels with a good force feedback stick.  Everthing from starting your engine, firing of guns, hits from bullets and flack, and rolling on the runway/deck are felt through the joy stick.
I have always used the keyboard for flight simulators before... but Combat Simulator 2 does not allow you to set the keyboard input settings to self center your airloins, rudder, etc... after pressing a direction key like most other flight simulators.  In other words, when you tell the plane to pull up, untill you press the 'dive' key, it will continue to pull up as if you were holding the 'pull up' key the entire time.  Very annoying if you are used to older flight sims.  So get a joy stick, and get a good one for optimal feel. (It's worth it).
The game its self is great.  If you played the old game 'Aces of the Pacific"" a lot, you will just absolutly love this game.  The graphics are unreal.  I still practicaly drool when I shoot a zero down and see chunks of it's body breaking off.  Even the smoke appearance from damaged planes is diffrent depending on what system is damaged.  When a ship sinks, it ACTUALLY sinks like a real ship, slowly dipping down into the water like the Titanic with one end still exposed.  When you shoot the water you can see little spurts of water shoot up where your bullets hit! I could go on and on.
So, if you have a fairly modern computer system, and enjoy WWII flight simulators I really think you will enjoy this one.  If you are new to the flight simulator scene, don't worry.  The game has a built in training missions to give you step by step lessons to teach you to fly. Now let's go torch some Zeros!",5.0
"Strangely, I don't recall some of these World Heroes games being this difficult. Thankfully, you can change the difficulty on this port!

It also includes the DLC to raise the level cap.  If you are looking to buy Borderlands 2, this is the one to get because it comes with everything and will save you a TON of money.  The replay value is great, and you can easily put 100s of hours into this game.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",5.0

"GENERAL OVERVIEW: The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is the first top down Zelda game since the 2005's Gameboy Advance title, The Minish Cap. This game is also first new handheld title in the Zelda franchise that Nintendo has released for one of their flagship products, the 3DS. The game is a direct sequel to the 1991 SNES title, A Link to the Past, which is one of the most highly acclaimed games in Nintendos bountiful back catalogue, featuring all new dungeons.

Make no mistake. A Link Between Worlds is the best Zelda game since Ocarina of Time or, barring that, A Link to the Past itself. For longtime Zelda players, Link Between Worlds may first initially lull you with its emotionally powerful, highly nostalgic rendering of Hyrule circa 1992, only to discover how deeply Nintendo is rearranging the Zelda template. A Link Between Worlds casts off series conventions (while still retaining its identity as a Zelda title).

To compare notes with another franchise, Hideo Kojima is radically restructuring the inherent design of the Metal Gear universe by making Metal Gear Solid 5"" an open world game rather than a tightly controlled stealth game. In order to ease players into the radical shift and new reinvention of Metal Gears signature stealth play, as adapted for an open world environment, Konami is releasing Ground Zero, which is a prologue to the main game, as a separate, introductory primer for Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain.

A Link Between Worlds is a reshuffling of the deck, a Ground Zero if you will for Zelda. Unlike the Metal Gear comparison, this game isn't about charting new territory though - its about returning to the very roots that made the series so special in the first place. Before we get into the ramifications and what this game may mean for Zelda in general, here are some pros and cons.

PROS:
Link navigating via merging into walls as a painting is both highly imagitive and drastically opens up new ways of solving puzzles and transvering Hyrule, breathing much needed life into Zelda's [intellectual side] cerebral side.
Excellent level design almost goes without saying. Nintendo has always excelled at level design.
-No farming for items. All usable items are manna-based, with a meter that regenerates over time. You never have to worry about running out of bombs or arrows again! (We so needed that in the original 1987 Zelda!
-Mini-games, including baseball (!!!) and chicken dodging
-Has a dual world setup (Hyrule and Lorule), like the original SNES game.

NEUTRAL:

-Borrows the overworld map of its SNES predecessor almost to the pixel. For veterans of the series, this borrowing will be highly nostalgic, though others may complain they are just rehashing Link to the Past. One benefit of using the same map is that it helps provide continuity for a series renowned for how disconnected each game appears in relation to others. (In 2011, Nintendo finally published an official timeline in Hyrule Historia. Guess what! There are THREE SEPARATE OFFICIAL TIME LINES, and all three branch off from Ocarina of Time.)
-The story is pretty simple. While some may think that detracts from the overall experience, I am fine with a simplified story. Nintendo has never been about story, and when they do get tangled into in-depth story-telling, you end up with three timelines and soap opera disasters like Metroid: Other M which by the end you lose almost all respect for Samus. Theres a reason why they keep narrative out of Mario games (though to be fair, the Mario RPGs have some good stories).

CONS:
-Visually feels little more than an upgrade to Link to the Past, rather than a distinct artistic style.
-The Overworld, while expansive in 1991, feels a little small by todays standards.
-Lorule (as opposed to Hyrule) just sounds like an idiotic linguist pun. This is just a minor personal complaint though.

THE MORE PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS OF MODERN ZELDA: Its not a secret to everybody (to lightly misquote a certain Mobin) that Zelda has grown increasingly stagnant in recent years.

Skyward Sword is by far the most devise of the mainstream Zelda installments, even more so than initial responses to the art style of Wind Waker circa 2003. The more flawed elements of that game are all game design decisions that became codified in the sacrosanct Ocarina of Time and over the years finally met their logical conclusion in Skyward Sword. Eiji Anouma, the main overseer of the series, has even stated in post Skyward Sword interviews that Nintendo is rethinking Zelda conventions in order to keep the series fresh and relevant due to lackluster response by players to recent titles.

Tevis Thompson has written a great, lengthy essay regarding the issues he believes is plaguing modern Zelda games. (The title is Zelda Just Keeps Getting Worse. But It Isn't Beyond Saving. It is well worth reading). Thompson is discussing Skyward Sword, the 2011 Wii game. Skyward Sword is by far the most devise of the mainstream Zelda installments, even more so than Wind Waker. While far too long to address Thompson point by point for an Amazon review, the essential summary of his complaints are three fold:

1. Zelda has gone from a vast, overworld experience to an increasingly narrowed, mechanical by rote design, rather than organic gameplay which invites multiple methods of play. Key quote: Modern Zeldas do not offer worlds. They offer elaborate contraptions reskinned with a nature theme, a giant nest of interconnected locks. Thompson describes Skyward Sword as a culmination of reducing the world into a series of bottlenecks. In other worlds, Zelda games have become so mechanical in nature that they have lot their sense of wonder and adventure and even (or perhaps especially) danger. The worlds also feel empty, a complaint I first voiced against Ocarina of Time. For all the grandeur of Hyrule Field, save for some Stalfos knights that appear after sunset and an occasional Peahat or too, its a pretty empty field. The sky in Skyward Sword is also notoriously void of any real exploratory content worth mentioning.

2. Lack of Difficulty. The two NES Zelda games (especially The Adventure of Link) can be brutal at times. Beginning with A Link to the Past, the difficulty of the Zelda franchise has been on a steep downward slope. Saturo Iwata, Nintendos President, has directly addressed this decrease in difficulty in Nintendo products.

3. No respect for the player. By design of bottle-neck environmental roadblocks (first heavily featured in Zelda II* and culminating in Skyward Sword), greatly reduced difficulty, and extemly intrusive journey companions that hold your hand every step of the way, Zelda feels more like a guided tour of Hyrule than a daring adventure with real danger at every turn. The puzzle elements have been greatly minimized due to constant direction.

RESTORING ADVENTURE TO ZELDA: A Link Between Worlds largely addresses Thompsons concerns. These are the practical, concrete game play mechanics in which A Link Between Worlds is reinvigorating Zelda.

-Death has consequences. When renting your items, you are able to keep said items for as long as you stay alive. However, if you die you lose your items.
-Challenge: Directly ties to the first point. The overworld isn't the grandiose, but almost entirely devoid of enemies, Hyrule Field. Instead, there are well armored foes intent on killing Link and LOTS OF THEM. Likewise, the dungeon bosses are more difficult than weve seen in a long time. They take skill and cunning to beat as well as figuring out how to best exploit their weak spot. The dungeon enemies themselves are no pushover either.
-Enemies are used as boundary markers. From Thompsons essay: Link must be allowed to enter areas he's not ready for. He must be allowed to be defeated, not blocked, by the world and its inhabitants. You can get into some areas that will push you to your max to escape alive, let alone in stunning victory.
-A Link Between Worlds returns to the open world feel of the original NES title, albeit in the confines of Hyrule as shown in A Link to the Past. Due to renting items, dungeons are largely (but not entirely) completeable in any order, rather than a pre-defined set path that must be followed at all costs.
-Item renting restores some of the wonder and adventure to the series, because this time around you are truly interested in the contents of treasure chests, knowing that they will hold something other than series trope items such as boomerangs, bows, etc.
-Fast Travelling: If you find yourself without necessary items for a dungeon, you can quickly get to the shop to get said item via warp points without excessive backtracking.
-No more Hey, Listen! For the first time in years, Link is on his own, left to figure out what he must do without constant rejoinders from the game helper of the week. To compensate, if you need assistance there is the very unintrusive Hint Glasses which are mentioned briefly and then never forced upon the player, or visiting fortune tellers, which is entirely at the players discretion. Just like the statue in the 1st palace of the Dark World where you must shoot an arrow in its eye to proceed or the backtracking in the Ice Palace, there will be moments you are left puzzling what to do.

WHAT A LINK BETWEEN WORLDS MEANS FOR THE ZELDA FRANCHISE: There are two main camps in Zelda Fandom: those who think Ocarina of Time is the best and those who think Link to the Past is best. While predictions are a dangerous venture at the best of times, A Link Between Worlds clearly indicates that Nintendo is not above radically rewriting conventions for one of its most successful IPs, returning them to earlier times. To return to the Metal Gear comparison with Ground Zero, A Link Between Worlds is laying the groundwork for the still unnamed (at the time of writing) Wii U Zelda game which we know is in development.

Appropriately enough for a series with three time lines, developmentally and in game design A Link Between Worlds has effectively ignored the last twenty years of its own franchise. Nintendo has returned to the original ethos and game philosophy of the first Zelda titles and have created an alternate point of development in which Aonuma has indicated he is fully intent upon pursuing. Anouma has confessed to never completing the original Zelda title and wanting to never make a game like that. Before this game, this attitude would explain why there is such a disconnect between the recent games and the trail-blazing originals.

When the game was first pitched to Miyamoto (before it was a Link to the Past sequel or even featured the painting), he declined, saying that it ""sounds like an idea that's 20 years old!. While the context is not exactly the same, Anouma and his team are finally returning to the hallmarks of Zelda that so captivated us in the first place (at least, gamers of my generation), returning to the older ideas of the series.

A Link Between Worlds is a course correction LONG OVER DUE, and if this game is any clear indication, not only have Anouma and his team learned from their mistakes with Skyward Sword, but are going all the way back to the very foundational elements of the series before Ocarina.

Aonuma has stated based on user feed back (now so readifuly plentiful via the Internet and Miiverse) that the new Wii U Zelda game will focus much more on the open-world feel so pioneered by the original NES classic that has been largely untouched by the series since then. Games such as the The Elder Scrolls and the Grand Theft Autos are more closely kin to the original Zelda than Skyward Sword If Anouma is to be believed, then the Wii U Zelda will be a reinvention of modern 3D Zelda titles. If Nintendo follows the direction established in Link Between Worlds, then the Wii U Zelda will be a grand reinvention indeed!

While Miyamoto is ultimately responsible for Zelda, the last fifteen years have largely been spearheaded by Anouma, and for the first time I feel that we are seeing how Nintendo would develop the series based on the original four games. We are returning to Miyamotos original vision for the series at long last!

*Whereas almost the entirety of Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda is open to the player, in each successive game the ability to explore became increasingly more and more confined either by necessity of the plot or that to progess to Dungeon 2, you must have an item from Dungeon 1, etc. Thompson points to A Link to the Past as the starting point of this mechanical trend in Zelda games (Oh, theres a wall with weird rocks. Use a bomb.), which is not wholly accurate. While minimally present in the original NES game, Zelda II is the first game that really locked you into a defined order of dungeons and locked off worlds. While Link to the Pasts Dark World dungeons are tremendously flexible in the order in which you complete them in A Link to the Past, there is absolutely no possible way for extensive sequence-breaking in Zelda II. Want to go to the Island Palace? You have to have the Faerie Spell, which can only be obtained by use of the hammer. Want to go to Maze Palace? Have to have the Raft from the Island Palace in order to cross over into eastern Hyrule. Want to go to the Sea Palace? Have to have the boots from the Maze Palace. To get into Three Rock Palace (or even access the southern portion of Hyrule in which that palace is located), you have to have the Flute from the Sea Palace to get by the River Devil guarding the bridge.",5.0

"There is so much more to do in SR2...
-4 different campain choices= 4 gangs to choose from
-lots of new guns and vehicles
-Planes
-Bikes
-quads
-helicopters
-Better custimization
-custimization of cribs
-way more activities
-way bigger city/ new city
-cruise control-very helpful
-good car handling unlike GTA 4 which sucked
-better graphics
-male or female
-your guy talks

Also if you have like 4 gang members following you and you hope in a 2 seater vehicle your 3 other gang members will steal another car and follow you -- very very helpful when doing missions. Also you get this awesome little dune buggy in the game and you can custimize EVERY vehicle in the game.

Cons-
*not a lot of hair choices
*missions are kind of short
*the clothes aren't as cool as SR 1 but still good

Thats all the things i didn't like in the game. Overall i would recommend this game to ANYONE especially if your a GTA fan this is 10x better.",5.0
"If you are looking for a game to show why you bought a PS2 in the first place, look no further. SSX's graphics are amazing with no slowdown and a high FPS (looks like it is at least 60!).

"Have you ever played the first Mercenaries game?
You are given a task, but you can execute anyway you can think.
Do you want to blast your way in? Or snipe from far away?
Heck, you could just steal a helicopter and just drop in from the sky.
The only limitations were your imagination.

This is the first game that I have played since then that gives you that same freedom.

For example, you have to stop a convoy of supply trucks in this game.
* You can bring a bridge down on top of them.
* You can block the road with other trucks and blow them up as the convoy approaches.
* You can approach from behind and run them off the road in a truck of your own.
* Heck, just stand in the middle of the road with a rocket launcher and pluck each one off.

For me, I love a game that makes you pause just to think of the most creative
destructive possible way to execute a mission. You become proud of your strategy.

The graphics are good enough.
The Geo-Mod technology that lets you blow up everything is awesome.
The targeting system could use some work, but it doesn't hurt the game,
just makes it more challenging.

You will have fun with this game.
I promise.",5.0

"I am about 20 hours into the game and have for the most part been only following the main quest. I have numerous side quest available to me at this point and I think the potential for 40-60 hours of gameplay is legit. So you are getting a lot for your 50-60 dollars. There were only a few titles this fall that have tempted me to shell out the full price for them now rather then wait 6-9 months and pick them up at a discount, this being one of them and I am not disappointed.

The voice acting is top notch and although the graphics do show some glitches from time to time, this is still a very nice looking game. It is similar in terms of gameplay to the other RPG's in the Bioware franchise, which to me is a good thing. Mass Effect with swords may be the best way to describe it. The content in the game is impressive and you can tell a lot of time and effort went into its creation. The story line thus far is cohesive and entertaining. After playing Mass Effect and Fallout 3 this game is a nice return to swords and sorcery for a while.

If you have liked any of the previous Bioware titles I would recommend picking up this game. Same if you liked Oblivion and have been waiting for something similar to come along in terms of setting, production values, and depth to the game.",5.0

Quite possibly one of the best games ever made,5.0
"This package includes  Tom Clancy's GHOST RECON, Tom Clancy's GHOST RECON: DESERT SIEGE, and Tom Clancy's GHOST RECON: ISLAND THUNDER.
GHOST RECON is the groundbreaking squad-based combat game. It is the best Tom Clancy game to date, and featured multiple strategies for playing, ranging from stealth to guns-blazing. The online play was phenomenal and free of lag; and can still be played. Graphics are good, but actually look a little dated.
GHOST RECON: DESERT SIEGE is the first expansion pack to GHOST RECON. It obviously took on a desert setting; but also featured many improvements. The game still had its excellent online play; but it seemed to be a slight rehash.
GHOST RECON: ISLAND THUNDER is the best and most recent expansion pack. The one-player difficulty is harder, but not to the point where people will quit. The multiplayer (online) levels seem more interesting this time, and have unique new places to take cover.
Each expansion pack improved over the last one, and made up for 3 great games. If you never tried an online squad-based combat game, you owe it to yourself. If you already own these, there is nothing new here. Console gamers who enjoyed SOCOM: US NAVY SEALS or who liked the port of GHOST RECON will find this interesting and worthwile. People who were disappointed in CONFLICT: DESERT STORM or who want a squad-based take on RAINBOW SIX would do wise also to check this out.",5.0

"where I tried the demo once, for about an hour, and *had* to have the game.

It breaks some recent gaming conventions by not just handing everything to the gamer, but by doing that actually makes the game better. My favorite part about it is the mapping system. You don't get a map that shows you where everything is... the game makes the map very much apart of the gameplay.

A huge part of the game is creating the map as you go along, with good rewards for doing so. This is an incredibly fun part of the game.

The ease/challenge mix is also very good -- and make good use of the maps you create. Most random RPG encounters that pop up are relatively easy, but as you make out your map, you'll eventually find areas with very difficult enemies on the map that are boss fights to the extreme. Maybe you could win (you'll have a good idea before the encounters begin), but often times winning is a Pyrrhic victory -- forcing you to have to retreat soon after from expending your magical energy and resources.

It adds a whole new dimension of strategy into the game, deciding if or when you want to tackle these addition threats to clear them -- or if you want to use your map and figure out how to get around them.

I haven't delved too deeply into the story yet, but so far, so good. I enjoy the character designs a lot, the high quality of the animation, the art style and cut scenes. I also enjoy it at a gameplay design level, how everything plays and works  -- Inns, your home, quests, the party system, character classes and powers.... they all work really well.

This RPG is incredibly refreshing so far and offers the perfect level of challenge and it looks and plays great on the 3DS. I'm very much looking forward to getting deeper into it.",5.0

Unlike other inexpensive versions of these games, the graphics on this are good, the software is very stable, and very reliable.  It doesn't come across as cheesy or cheap in any way. High quality game(s)!

"When I first heard about the new game I couldn't wait, and I definitely wasn't let down! The new game wonderful, plenty of wild animals to befriend, bears, foxes, mice, ducks, birds,etc. You also have plenty of new things to plant like; Carnations, Marguerites, Pink Roses, Casablancas, watermelons, red roses, blue roses, white roses, sun flowers, Gerbera, Nadeshiko, Daikon,
Bok Choy, Gentian, and snow Drops. Everyone in the towns either bluebell or Kohana love flowers. though they often ask for snow drops when you might not have any. You also have new items to Forage for! basically; Bamboo, plums, apricots, brown mushroom, coral mushroom, trumpet mushroom, and blueberries of course you get to forage for all the normal stuff like; chamomile, mint, lavender, bamboo shoots, shimeji, chestnuts, walnuts, shitake and poisonous mushrooms and weeds.
of course you have the new Animals. The Alpaca and Honey Bees. as well as the Cows, sheep, and Chickens as well as the dogs and cats and a horse. Now you start off with a pony but you can rent better horses later on. You also have a cart you can take with you and when you run out of room in your bag toss things into your cart. the horse pulls the cart along and you can buy better carts as you go.
You also can make Irrigation trenches, when you plant which makes it easier to water them and give them the fertilizer. Later on in second year you can meet Oracle, who gives you potions for your animals and crops. ^.^
Your goal through out the game is to make the mayors become friends which can be done by attending the cooking festivals or participating them. as you get them to get along better the tunnel between the towns will clear up therefore providing better access to the mines if you get far enough. but you can sometimes find ores while foraging on the mountain.
befriending the wild animals is slightly hard but kind of easy. Bears like the honey you can produce once you start farming with the bees, after Eileen builds you a beehive. Foxes like eggs. ducks like the small fish you can catch with your hands (pretty easy and also new! you stand in shallow water and chase the fish and press a. though sometimes you get boots or old toy balls.)
Like in Rune factory you can go to a request board and find things for villagers.

You still have the orchard trees so never fear! there are some that are slightly new, you can have Cherry Trees, Peach, cocoa, coffee beans, and Mandarin as well as the apple grape, and banana.
and you can still plant your grains, rice, wheat and buckwheat and soy beans.

but lets not forget the new Bachelors and Bachelorettes! The Guys are Ash sells cows, chickens, sheep and alpaca with his mother and younger sister who he often spoils; Cam who lives in bluebell stays in with Laney and her father. will sell you flowers on certain days, and also makes Bouquets and Perfume for you out of the flowers you plant or find in the wild, Dirk (dirk from Grand Bazaar) will live in kohana and appears in your first year, Hiro a doctor lives in kohana, Kana sells pets and lives in kohana, and Mikhail he will live in either town you live in and will appear a day before the music festival.

The girls are Alisa met in SUNSHINE ISLANDS and ISLAND OF HAPPINESS. for those of you who kept wishing to marry her here is your chance!!! She shows up when you raise Nathan's friendship up, and he appears in your game on winter 3 of your first year. She'll live at bluebell Town hall when she appears.

Georgina who lives in bluebell sells pets and horses and carts with her father Grady. she loves flowers and animals.

Laney a girl who loves to make sweets and runs a cafe with her dad.  she lives in bluebell town.

Nori who lives a kind girl who runs the seed shop in Kohana with her father Gombe.  she also will make you your new outfits if you raise your friendship with her and keep an eye on the request board.

Oracle lives on the mountain in the mid area. Her shrine is on the Northern Side of the Hill. she eventually tells you what her real name is.

Reina also Lives in Kohana and spends her time getting plants and flowers. Give her rocks and flowers and she will be very pleased.

all in all the game is definitely worth it! If you enjoyed the other games you should really pick this one up. Enjoy your gaming and semper fi!",5.0

First, the gameplay. This game will have you hooked until you can't stop because of the great story, voice acting, and gameplay.

Second, the graphics. These graphics are top of the line, state of the art. The texture is amazing.

Better than the Sony charge station for PS3 controllers. That one had adapters that permanently snapped onto the controller that fit in the charge station. Nice how it stored the controller and easy to place the controller in the cradle, but if you need to replace the controller, you better be careful removing the adapter because you can't get replacements.",5.0
"This game is pretty fun, if you know how to stay alive and not get shot. If you get shot, its very likely you will die. If you're not dead, then you are injured. And if you are injured, you can't shoot accurately.

I played Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, which I think was the first military war game created where you are free to roam the island and drive whatever vehicles you can get yourself into. This is what I like about these 2 games: The ability to do multiple stuff to complete your mission. Not only that, you get to control your squad as well.

I played ARMA on my friend's computer and his is quite different. In the cut scenes, it has playback video with reporter talking and walking about. With ARMA Gold, you have a soldier talking in the background with a still picture (maybe its because ARMA Gold includes 2 expansion set to it).

To succeed in this game requires thinking and strategy. If you shoot your gun at the enemy, the enemy will eventually find you. Sometimes, they will be right behind you. So shoot and then move to a new position, while at the same time, watching your back. ""Saving your game is your best friend in this game""",5.0

"I'm not usually this enthusiastic about the things I review (And I don't usually review here) but I have to note my utter surprise and amazement in this product.

I've dealt with a couple of Skin/decals before for both this system (DSi) and others but I have to say I've never had an easier time of placing, and getting it right, of a skin before in all the times I've done it. I don't know if it was luck or a particularly good product cut but the item went onto the DSi with such ease that I had -oh lets say- an additional 20 minutes I didn't think I'd have -20 minutes I thought I'd be spending cussing with raised blood pressure.

The image on the item is crisp and clean, even after a months use by a rather rough and tumble kid, making this a great to protect your DSi from scratches without the need to add extra bulk to the item that might be unseemly to the user. The fact that the skin also features a lot of Pokemon on it is a nice added bonus.

The materials used in the product are high quality and meet a thickness standard that we really liked -it was neither too thick nor too thin. And as I've mentioned above has withstood the kid test pretty well over the last month+ that its been in place.

Overall we've found this to be a great product and if any of the other skins/decals made by the same company compare to this one they'll surely have a repeat customer in us.",5.0
"Without question, TMNT for Gameboy Advance is the best game out of the TMNT series, and might even be one of the best games for Gameboy Advance entirely.

On Easy level, the game is very easy.  On Normal level, its VERY hard and challenging.  On Hard level, it's impossible!  You have to be a serious video game Guru to beat it on hard.

"I've always enjoyed stealth games like Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, Hitman, Thief, etc., and I even take the stealth approach in games that aren't stealth per se, like Crysis 2, Fallout 3, Far Cry 4 and Deus Ex. So, I'm a big fan of stealth. The Splinter Cell series has always been my favorite, and I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing MGS Ground Zeros earlier this year and found that it had taken some of the things I love about Splinter Cell and incorporated them into the world of Metal Gear. So when The Phantom Pain started getting high critical praise, I decided to get this game at launch (I typically wait for a price drop on most games). Man, it was totally worth it.
I think this is hands down the best stealth action game I've ever played. The variety of gameplay, the open world, the deep upgrade system, and the excellent controls make this a truly fantastic game. I don't really care about the story in Metal Gear games (they don't really make any sense to me), but the one here seems to take a backseat to your own moment to moment story that unfolds as you play, and I wouldn't have it any other way. There are occasional story driven cut scenes, but they never overstay their welcome. What really impresses me is how the game gives you the freedom to approach any mission however you want. Your loadout, your buddy, your landing zone, all decided by you. You even pick the time of day. You're only limited by what equipment you've unlocked, which depends entirely on what you decide to research and develop.
One big selling point for me is the controls. In the past, Metal Gear games have felt awkward or clumsy to play, and I often had difficulty coming to grips with the nuances of controlling Snake. The Phantom Pain has a ""Shooter"" control scheme in the options menu, and it completely eliminated that problem. Also, the gameplay just feels really tight and responsive. Every time I got spotted or made a mistake, I felt like it was my fault, not due to some clumsy controls.
Overall, The Phantom Pain is not only my favorite Metal Gear game, but my new favorite stealth game. Period.",5.0

It also includes new vehicles such as a flash speeder, police cruiser(basically a blue naboo starfighter)and of course, the naboo starfighter.

"Released back in 1995, Myst is a classic game that revolutionized the gaming industry. Rand and Robyn Miller created a new type of game which diverted from the typical mass market and took off into a fascinating and innovative direction. It's hailed as a landmark in the industry and praised for both its aesthetics and story.

I think that Myst is best described as an experience rather than merely a video game. Its creators strived to develop a world rich with detail and intrigue, with a subtle narrative intertwined into the strange yet beautiful surroundings. As the game begins, you are dropped onto the island of Myst without very much information to guide you. What immediately strikes you as unique about this experience is that there are no friendly characters to help you on your way, no enemies to fight, and not a very clear purpose. The game is largely about just exploring your surroundings and experimenting with different devices around the various worlds. This is what makes the game so immersive. The graphics of Myst, though not quite as extravagant as today's, were definitely of high quality. Cyan built its 3D world through an extensive layout of still images and QuickTime movies, and the end result is simply amazing. Navigation is node-based, meaning that you don't necessarily walk through the environment but rather point and click your way through your surroundings. Each new section loads as if you really had relocated, giving the appearance of movement. Making a 3D world in this manner might seem strange, but at the time it was a necessary shortcut to make it possible to run the game on computers without a lot of RAM and processor power. Even by today's standards, I still think the environments look impressive.

So what exactly does the gameplay entail? As you explore the island, you discover two journals with missing pages, each of which belong to Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar. Your main objective is to travel through the different worlds, or Ages, and retrieve the missing pages from each book. As you recover each page, you learn more about each brother, and you must try to discover who is lying and who is telling the truth. In the end, it will be up to you to decide their respective fates. Your journey is not easy, for you will have to solve rather challenging puzzles in order to progress throughout the worlds. This can often be frustrating, for the puzzles' solutions are not always intuitive. It will take much patience and observation, and perhaps even a little help.

The sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting. The soundtrack consists of strange, sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area. Moreover, the sounds are integral to the gameplay, for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing. You will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face. This is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game. The music makes your surroundings feel foreign and believable.

Myst was groundbreaking for its time, and it started an incredible journey that would spark several sequels. It's an experience that is visually, musically, and intellectually stimulating, and though the game is a bit dated now, I still think it's worth playing if you enjoy a good challenge. As many have mentioned, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, but at the same time it will most likely make you want to continue the adventure with Riven.",5.0

"I know that's a pretty bold statement, but it's true. NHL '93 incorporates all of the best elements of the NHL Hockey series. The thing that separates this game from the rest is the aggressive nature of gameplay. Fights come fast and furious and there is blood present after you best an opponent(something that was since removed from all subsequent versions). The gameplay is nothing less than flawless. I will never forget the first time I turned this game on and the players actually slid on the ice, from that point on I was hooked. Although the graphics now seem dated, they were revolutionary for their time. Nothing would give me more pleasure back in the day then beating my brother in NHL '93 with the Hartford Whalers featuring Murray Craven, John Cullen and Sean Burke. As a hockey fan, you just can't get anymore old school than NHL '93. A MUST OWN VIDEO GAME! In fact, I still have my Sega Genesis just so I can play this game. Highest Recommendation.",5.0

"Full disclosure: I stink at First Person Shooters.

Actually, let me update that a bit... I stink at *most* first person shooters.  I actually wasn't that horrible with Rainbow Six: Las Vegas, but that is a completely different animal than the Call of Duty series, where I traditionally stink badly.

Still... I have a lot of fun playing the game and I hope that my horrible multiplayer game play doesn't ruin the fun for any one unlucky enough to have me on their team in TDM (Team Death Match) or the other online co-ops modes that I might play.

Call of Duty (CoD): Modern Warfare 3 (MW3) is a fun game that looks awesome on my HDTV and makes me glad that I splurged and got the Hardened Edition of the game as compared to the regular version.  Since I ordered early enough to get it at regular street pricing, from one of those Best places to Buy from (I know, I know, I feel dirty having to admit that here at my preferred retailer :-( ), I didn't face the market driven pricing that now exists here and yet I still got all of the benefit from everything that came in the package.  The year of Elite status, the Founder status, etc.

I like the nice Steel case that comes in the Hardened package, and like the other perks as well, though I'd have to ask just what the manufacturer was thinking in making the box as big as they have.  Compared to the contents there-in, the thing is freakin' huge and just plain wasteful.  Really, it didn't need to be nearly as thick as it is.  Perhaps 1/3 the thickness would have worked (easily) and yet the box is what it is and I'm left looking at it thinking that I should just chuck it into the trash and put that much more waste into the landfills.  Shameful.

I wish that the package included the nice T-shirt that I was also able to get at the Buy More (at a small added cost).  That might have made it a little less of a waste in that big package.  Rather like the new Rush Time Machine Blu-ray (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Time-Machine-2011-Live-in-Cleveland-Blu-ray/dp/B005D0RDKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland [Blu-ray</a>]) that I also got at the Big box store, at least that package included the free Rash T-shirt in it (and once that was removed the flimsy box was easy to fold up for disposal in the recycling container.  Ack, I'm such a Nerd/Geek :/

Ok, a few other thoughts here... I really would love to add the hyper-expensive CoD:MW3 headset by Turtle Beach&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PS3-Call-of-Duty-MW3-Ear-Force-Delta-Limited-Edition-Programmable-Wireless-Gaming-Headset-with-7-1-Surround-Sound/dp/B005EEMYCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PS3 Call of Duty: MW3 Ear Force Delta: Limited Edition Programmable Wireless Gaming Headset with 7.1 Surround Sound</a>&nbsp;or perhaps the CoD glasses: Gunnar Optiks, but the price on those puts me off a bit.  I mean really, that much of a premium on the headset just because of the badging/logos and the same on the glasses?  And are the glasses really that helpful?  In the end I probably shouldn't be playing that long at a time, and even if I do want to play a while and be relatively quiet, my older X31 headset (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ear-Force-X31-Digital-RF-Wireless-Game-Audio-Xbox-Live-Chat/dp/B002KSPL36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ear Force X31 Digital RF Wireless Game Audio + Xbox Live Chat</a>) works well enough and didn't cost me nearly that much.  That doesn't mean that I might not eventually want to get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ear-Force-PX5-Programmable-Wireless-7-1-Dolby-Digital-Surround-Sound-Headset-with-Bluetooth/dp/B003O6N64Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ear Force PX5 Programmable Wireless 7.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound Headset with Bluetooth</a>.  That might still be pretty sweet to have, but again, I'm not rushed to go plunk down my disposable income on a set.",5.0
Good,5.0
This is a true great platform game last one quite as good i palyed was Jak and Daxter. Game gives you a free form environment and also makes you retrace somestimes within the story but with great appeal. Never quite sure the length of the game you have left and jsut interesting all around lots and lots of weapons and way to tackle every mission. Would recommend for anyone who loves freefrom platform games,5.0
