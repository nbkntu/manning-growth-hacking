"Two and a half years in development this game was eagerly awaited by the train sim community as the title which would re-define the genre after a long gap between genuine new releases.

Unfortunately I can only concur with previous reviews regarding the buggy and flawed game we have been given. It appears as if all the money and effort has been expended on the graphics engine, which does not look a whole lot better than improved MSTS/Trainz anyway, rather than the core features such as signalling to make a train sim work properly. The cabs are quite detailed and 3D but not many of the switches or levers work correctly. In external view the train often looks like a sprite floating over the ground and in both cab and exterior view there's a disturbing and nausea inducing side to side ""hunting"" of the track which, if it's supposed to represent the cab swaying, is totally wrong.

Sound is not much better. The HST is quite good but the Turbo DMU sound like it was sampled from a bin lorry. The Deltic is rather weak and the Class 47 just doesn't sound right. there's no distiction between the level or type of sound heard in exterior or interior view either. Track sound is awful a sort of disembodied tinkle every now and again or when you cross over points. A Gameboy would put it to shame.
The North American version is missing the York to Newcastle route of the European release with a version of Cajon Pass in California instead. Although the publisher (now working under the Rail Simulator Developments - RSDL - banner rather than Kuju) has stated they will release the respective routes at some stage (free or paid unclear) this creates an immediate incompatibility between the two versions for third party routes etc. which use objects not found in its transatlantic counterpart.

One reasonable point (which is why it gets two stars rather than one) is the train physics. The HST actually takes a realistic time and distance to accelerate and brake though the top end of the power curve is questionable on all the traction. They should just about hold top speed one notch below full power but they want to keep on going. steam physics is about on a par with MSTS, that is to say a reasonable stab but wide of the mark. It does not seem possible to induce wheelslip on any of the locomotives.

Where the sim really falls down is on the operations and signalling. The signalling is poorly scripted and implemented - it does not give proper warning of upcoming junctions and can easily cause your train to derail or collide with another even when you get the correct aspects. The German signalling seems to be derived from the UK signalling and is totally wrong for DB practice. There's a lack of proper warnings for upcoming speed limits. The ""Track Monitor"" is useless as it only shows the state of the line about 800 metres ahead.

Very few activities or scenarios are included in the box, some will have beginners scratching their heads with complex shunting while others are ""broken"" as a result of the pathetic signalling. It's not possible to run to a timetable and the game shipped without the proper tools to create such an activity. The development tools need to be downloaded seperately and only after signing a licence with RSDL - reason for this is not entirely clear, but seems tied up with ensuring any commercial third products sold for this sim pay a royalty fee back to the developer. Route building is not as intuiative or easy as MSTS and light years behind Trainz - everything has to be set up via blueprints and the documentation, which also has to be registered for and downloaded separately is quite muddy in places and seems more aimed at the technical high end (commercial?) orientated user than the little guy. The route editor itself is quite buggy particularly when it comes to joining tracks, creating junctions or laying roads and fences.

In conclusion it's a bit of a mess and a disappointment. There is potential there but it will take a bucket load of patches and/or a major rewrite of some of the code to get there. At the time of writing (Feb 2008) a patch is imminent but if you're really eager for a new train sim you might be better advised to wait and see what Microsoft have to offer in their proposed new train simulation some time in 2009.",2.0

"In my humble opinion, the original Crysis to this day remains one of the best FPS of all time for so many reasons that I couldn't possibly list them all.  There are some obvious ones, graphics, realistic game-play, enemy A.I., lush environments, non-linearity, destructible environments, etc.  But one of the things that's not so obvious is the following:  Most video games that I can think of start one off at the very bottom; little to no items, weapons, upgrades, abilities, etc., etc.  You basically have to build your character from the ground up and near the end of the game you become this real bad @ss.  The original Crysis completely shattered this formula.  In that game, you started off with everything on the nano suit unlocked, fully powered, and ready for immediate use.  In other words, you were a complete bad @ss right from the beginning.

In the first couple of levels no one has a real chance against you.  You really are completely superior to anything the game throws your way; and this makes total sense because that's what the nano suit is for, to make you superior in every way to your enemies.  And this is not to say the game was easy, because it wasn't.  It just meant that if you used your brain and all of the resources at your disposal, you were virtually invincible because again, that's what the nano suit is all about.  I recall climbing into the back of a jeep and taking control of a chain gun and attempting to mow down some enemies when all of a sudden a tall palm tree realistically falls down and instantly kills some of the enemies I had missed.  I soon realized that I HAD unintentionally caused this to happen because my gun fire caused the tree to fall, and as a gamer, this was a MIND BLOWING moment that cannot be replicated in Crysis 2.  In the original Crysis, if you were in a vehicle and an enemy shot at your tires, the tires actaully went flat and the vehicle was disabled.  I mean, you cannot find gameplay as simple and realistic as this is any generic shooter the current day.

So this is why I had to buy Crysis 2 on day one, because I have so many fond memories of the original Crysis.  But I have to admit I've made a grave mistake.  You see, Crysis 2 is INFERIOR in every way to the original Crysis.  Others reviewers have already mentioned it but it begs repeating, making Crysis 2 for PC a console port was a mistake of EPIC proportions.  Crysis 2 doesn't feel like Crysis, it doesn't taste like Crysis, it doesn't smell like Crysis.  The graphics are worse than the original.  There are NO detailed settings adjustments to be made.  Every time your aim changes, there this horrifying, choppy blur on the screen. The weapons are very inaccurate.  Helicopter's spot and shoot you even when you're cloaked.  I walked into this new area cloaked, and about a dozen enemy soldiers showed up near my position stating that I had been ""seen"" in the area.  Really?  I'm cloaked remember.  This would have been impossible in the original Crysis because being cloaked meant something in that game.  There are about six ammo dumps in every area, not to mention that enemy ammo drops, making it impossible to run out of ammo, or even a need to conserve and that gives this game a tremendous ""arcade-like"" and unrealistic feel.  The nano suit is a terrible downgrade from the original and actually makes you a much weaker character.  One example is when you use max armor.  In this game, you actually lose suit energy even if you're not taking damage.  In the original, the energy decreased ONLY when you took on enemy fire, which again, makes much more sense and offered greater realism.

You want to know what is the worst thing of all, the nano suit actually TELLS you what to do.  It treats you like the dumbest person on the planet that is incapable of thinking for yourself.  As a gamer, this is insulting beyond description.  Personally, I want to be able to use my brain in order to assess the situation, come up with an effective strategy, and implement that strategy as a spec ops soilder would in real combat.  In the words of Clint Eastwood (Heartbreak Ridge), I want to IMPROVISE, ADAPT, and OVERCOME.  I'm a grown man, I don't need my hand held especially in a game like this where you're supposed to man-up, after all, you're the savior and hero remember?

The more I write this review, the more disgusted I'm getting with this game, seriously.  ANYONE who thinks this is even a decent game has never played the original.  No more Call of Duty clone garbage for me, it's over.  With the exception of Uncharted 3 and Battlefield 3, I'm done with all of other shooters.",2.0
"First, I've been a fan of the Thief games since day 1, including fan-made missions. I cannot recommend this game though, because of the large amount of bugs that will likely never be fixed. Let's start with the game-play. Sometimes when you jump up to mantle a ledge, strange things will happen. You can either fall through the game world and fail the mission, or get stuck in a weird floating pose. When you're in the floating pose, you cannot jump and it is a royal pain to return the game to normal. Whatever immersion the game has instilled in the player goes right out the window at these points.

Of course, that is assuming you can get the game to run in the first place. This game does not like multi-core processors. Unless you either disable the other CPU cores, or limit the game to use only one core, you'll also have problems. Back when this game came out, we already had HyperThreading CPUs, which would cause problems like this because they show up as having multiple cores.

If the publishers/developers would stand by their product and patch these issues out, it would be acceptable. However, we got only one patch for this game, which fixed some AI issues. If you simply must play this game, I recommend buying it used in order to avoid supporting publishers/developers who don't fix glaring issues with their products.",2.0
"Well, while this keyboard has a decent feel, it is built VERY cheaply. Extremely flimsy plastic and customer support is virtually non existant. Save yourself the hassle and just buy a logitech instead. I expected so much more out of such a high priced keyboard.",2.0
"first of all, when this game came out, i was ready to play it nonstop. but i cant do that because i constantly lag and its just not fun when you shoot somebody and just won't die! the game is good but theres not enough support from the developers to justify buying it! this is the last game i will ever buy from EA again.
its not my connection. im usually the host IN EVERY OTHER GAME SUCH AS CALL OF DUTY> MGS4. wait for this game to go down to like $20..
ps. iam willing to trade the game if anybody wants it. i will take bioshock 2 or any other game, i just want to get my moneys worth and i cant do that with this game.",2.0

"ok first off, THIS IS NOT WEAPONS GRADE PLASTIC.  i have family member in the SWAT team and i've held an HK G36K and i can tell you that this lancer rifle replica is not weapons grade plastic.  the chainsaw handle/ lever is so flimsy that you can snap it off with little effort.  the ""chainsaw"" sound sounds nothing like a chainsaw saw, picture loose platic vibrating loudly.

other than those three things, this product is awesome.  it's wonderfully detailed and feels good in the hands.  but like the title says, this is only for the fans that just have to have a little piece of the gears universe in their hands.  buy it to collect it.  play with it and expect to break certain pieces (chainsaw handle, scope, barrel, maybe even the handle itself as it's not made from one piece of plastic)",2.0
"I recently got right into the ""NBA Street vol"" games, and I figured it was going to be hard to top those games on PS2, but then I read a few of the 4 star reviews here and people seemed to be praising the game, and a few said it was even better then ""NBA Street"", and that this game supposedly had the best controls for a basketball game on PS2. What misleading lies I beleive those reviews to be now. I think a person or persons is having a laugh on this site by giving good reviews to such a poor game.

First off, this game is simmilar to ""NBA Street"", which is pretty much an adaption of the ""NBA Jam"" games. However, this version is only one on one play. There is one other mode of 1 on 1 on 1 that allows 3 players to play at once, against each other, but as much as it sounded interesting at first, it's as annoying to play as the regular 1 on 1 modes in this game, as it makes matches longer, more frustrating, and fewer points awarded to your profile to unlock anything you want to eventually do in the game with custom created players.

How long can one on one match ups last and remain fun? It took me 3 hours maybe before I was bored to death with the lack of options of gameplay this one here offers. I think I mentioned in my review of ""NBA Street Vol 2 or 3"" that an improvement could have been offering a one on on mode, but after playing ""Ballers"", it makes me think that the team of ""Street"" probably did explore that possibility, and found it to be as boring as playing this game here.

So, onto some other bad points. Loading times are ridicules. It takes about 3 minutes to power up this game and get through all the stupid copyright and intro screens before you are finally asked to press start, and even then doing so, more loading time for the games main menu. If you accidentally go back to the title screen, guess what, more loading time just to go back to the menu screen again. It's even worse when you pick players, but it's defaulted to the Eastern NBA stars, you then have to press O to go to the list of team categories, then select one with NBA stars, legends and custom players scattered all over the place. The selection menu is atrocious.

Once you do get into the game, and you have skipped the annoying MC Paronormal or something, you finally begin to play, but are then bombarded with pop-up boxes explaining what button does what... is there no way to ever turn that off? Then the action begins, and you are forced to pretty much just keep smashing the ball into your opponents face and running for the basket for a dunk, because for the most part, no matter what your chars stats are, they will miss a jump shot from anywhere. Even with new dunks unlocked, you feel very limited to what you can do after a while, and that's something this game will never hold a candle to when compared to the ""NBA Street"" series, it's controls where smooth, easy, and fun to use, where as this game here tried something simmilar, but feels less responsive to any variety of dunks you can preform. I also miss the turbo blocking, because block's in this game are just a random act of 50/50.

The create a baler I will say is about the only decent thing about this game. You can make better looking ballers then that in NBA Street games, however, later with the lack of options and moves to do, it's just nice looking set of graphics covering the dung programming hiding behind it. The create a ballers process also only provides you a certain amount of points to use for creating skills and looks, and then you have to play matches to earn more... why must video game makers beleive that is what players want? It's a no wonder the NBA Live series is so popular, at least when you created a player you don't have to play 10,000 matches to finally max out the created players stats, and by the time you do that, you are completely sick of a game. this game here allows you to start off by giving a maximum of 35 points in one skill level, later when you edit your character again you can advance up to 99.... why? someone tell me whose stupid idea it was and in what game they did that first where someone figured it would be more fun to make you earn your stats rather then just create, adjust, play!?

Filling up the rest of the disk where space could have been used to create more options, modes and more than just 1 on 1 matches are a bunch of pointless NBA videos of a bunch of guys you will probably never have any interest in ever watching their video anyway... it only took me a glance at looking at Dominque Wilkins 1 minute video of NOT the best highlights of his career and him saying, ""I love to play the game"" with that annoying ""letssssssssss get ready to rumbleeeeeeee"" guy talking over it.

While I'm on that, the music in this game is just horrendous. A bunch of nobodies rapping about how they gonna be the streets and earn money in the nba someday... gimme a break, PAY FOR A DECENT SET OF SONGS, there is no way anyone could have been paid to write and record that.

I'm done ripping on this game, i've said my piece, flipped it the bird, and thrown it's ballers in the bin.",2.0
"After playing ""The Longest Journey"" (sigh-I loved it) I was getting edgy for something new.  I wanted to see if there were any games out there like it. ""The Longest Journey"" is still my favorite game and I wanted something similar or better (if possible).  I read all the reviews of THIS game.  Half of the reviews seemed favorable and the other half hated it.  What to do...I contacted, via email some of the reviewers to ask them if they think I would like the game.  Consensus showed I should get it. Okay so here goes.....The game began with little graphic and exciting scenes of what to expect and then BOOM! The actual game had horrible graphics. I mean real bad.  It's so pixilated you can barely make out the Sphinx itself.  I proceeded anyway because I was kind of feeling the Indiana Jones hype and went further..to the first and obvious puzzle.  It seemed hard at first but I ""unlocked"" the puzzle in 5 minutes! That's right! 5 minutes.  Okay, I gave it one more chance...I tried to find my way to the next step and the 180 degree turns and slow ""Myst"" click and move steps got me so annoyed and lost it took me an hour just to figure out where I needed to go.  I could never get to the spot I needed to, because apparently I needed to download a patch to proceed.  I found out after calling some game stores at the local mall that you need a few of these patches to improve the game.  It is playable without them, but extraordinarily difficult.  I really wanted this game to succeed. I had done my homework, giving it a fair chance and it failed.  It really was like an Egyptian ""Myst"" minus the beautiful graphics, intellectually challenging puzzles and lacking a great plot.  I am still remaining open to new ideas from anybody.  I have since, returned ""The Riddle of the Sphinx"" and am looking forward to suggestions from other game reviewers.  If anybody has ideas for me please feel free to email. Thank You.  And to those of you who were so kind and helpful...I'm truly glad you liked the game..I guess it just wasn't for me.",2.0
"What I liked about the game: it has a good soundtrack and fine visuals. I liked the voice of the talking chip and not too many, but not bad weapons and I guess that was it. I finished this game only once, but it seems there are 2 endings in there, depending on one choice that you make in-game. That's a good feature however I will not play this game again just to see the difference.
The first time I've heard about the game I thought I'd like and would give it 5 stars for sure. But this game is boring, the plot is nothing more than just okay, the characters are also there but I didn't get attached to them at all. Some bosses were just really hard to kill on normal difficulty and you can't change this difficulty in-game. I also disliked all this button-mashing.",2.0
"The Sega Game Gear was a brilliant idea, ahead of it's time, but perhaps that is why it never took off.  The colored screen was magnificent.  As the previous comment said, Game Boy was hard to over take.  Yes Game Boy was in black and white, but it had all of the other things going its way.  For example, Game Gear is more expensive, the games are more expensive, it's bigger, and the WORST thing about a Game Gear is that it's not  much of a portable gaming system because it ran on 6 AA's I believe...and it died in about 40 minutes of play.  The screen being lit was nice for night rides but only lasting 40 mins or so was not acceptable.  A good system if you plan on sitting next to an outlet and playing but if you want to travel with it, I'd pass on the Game Gear unless you like paying more than the price of the Game Gear on batteries every couple months.",2.0

"The game starts out rather fun. It was extremely promising, but after the introduction when you're supposed to go off on your own and choose your quests as RPGs often make you do, I was lost, and the controls (especially going into hyperspace) are hard to remember, and even if you can remember, the game is hard to control.

The story is cheesy, cliche sci-fi. Evil totalitarian government, check. Main character's deceased father was famous, check. Smartass pilot, check. Attempted but failed female sidekick who adds nothing to the story, check. unrealistically saturated colors, check. Terrible dialogue, check.

I didn't have a good time playing even though I waited for this game for months. Complete disappointment. One of the only things I got from it was 5 (Maybe 10) gamerscore for crashing into a planet.",2.0

"I've had this game for a couple years now.  I've always been interested in historical events, particularly wars and I have always wanted there to be a great game made about one of these events.  In this case, the Civil War.  But I'm afraid I'm still searching, as AC: Divided Nation clearly does not fit the bill for me. I bought it online thinking it would be sort of like Command and Conquer or Age of Empires, which if it was like either it would totally kick butt!  But it's nothing like it.  Even after playing it many times, I still find it frustrating.  One major problem is it freaks out frequently and I have to close it and reopen it to fix it.  Another problem is it just seems rough around the edges, like it was slapped together in a basement the night before it was due, it doesn't seem fine tuned or anything.  It is frequently confusing and reading the manual won't help because it doesn't address any of the problems, so most of the time I would just tinker around until I finally figured it out or just give up.  Another thing that really made me mad was the little telegraph offices that are stationed around the map in random map mode, every time I would march guys by them, 10 or 20 guys would freeze if they touched it.  I couldn't get most of them unstuck and ended up killing them to get them out of the way.  It was like there was glue next to it or something.

There are three modes: campaign, single skirmish, and random map.  The campaign follows a specific general, like Grant, Lee or Jackson on several battles.  Single skirmish is just like it says, there is only one battle instead of several like in campign.  And random map is a poor attempt to copy C&C.  Instead of just being given the troops and resources like in the first two modes, in random map you have to collect supplies and make men, just like C&C or Age of Empires.  But everything is so much more confusing, tedious, and annoying that it just makes me quit and actually play C&C, even though I would rather play in a Civil War era.

Bottom line: don't get this game if you're looking for a fun Civil War game (it also does the Mexican War, where you can be Texas or Mexico and the War of 1812).  Unfortunately, to my knowledge, there isn't a good Civil War game out right now.  History Channel: Civil War gets like a 5 out of 10 on several gamer websites, which isn't horrible but even the reviewer himself said it was only worth a few mindless hours of fighting and that's it.  Hopefully we will get lucky and some company will make a good game, for PC, PS3, Xbox 360 or all of the above.  This game isn't expensive at all, but no sense to waste even 5 or 10 dollars on this as you will probably dislike it.  You almost have to graduate from West Point to be able to understand everything in this game!  I think they went way over the top in trying to make it super realistic, it's like they were so intent on doing that that they forgot about the fun part.  Come on!  The whole reason I play games is to have fun and relax, not get frustrated and mad.",2.0

"This game was excellent when it originally came out on the Gamecube. I loved it. It is still very good on the Wii.

My problem is this; Why re-release a game, soley because of the Wii's wireless aiming capabilities (well not solely, I'm sure it was the money too), and then completely ignor the fact that the WiiMote has a trigger on the bottom of it. This game could be so much better, if the option for changing your controls existed, or if the re-designers just used some common sense (duh, pull trigger to shoot, not pull trigger to aim). Had they just done that, the game would be worth playing again.

If you've already played it on the GC, it isn't worth another go. Nothing was changed for the better.

If you haven't played it, I'd suggest it, but I'd get the GC version, or just connect a classic controller to your WiiMote to play it with some original controls.",2.0

"Its just ok. My gripe with the game is that since its a retro style game, it shouldve had all of its strong points in story, game-play, and solid control functionality. But it seems like all of the things many 8 bit games got right more than 30 years ago, Devolver said ""meh, whatever. Just make it $10 bucks."" If this game was solid in all categories I wouldve gladly paid $30-$40. But Im glad I got it on sale and used some gift card credit. The concept fo the game is solid. Most of the execution is solid. But the certain parts that don't work properly really give it a rushed, cheap feel. Its something that I didn't expect from Devolver. I bought this right after playing through Shadow Warrior (one of the greatest games made of the past 10 years). So I expected this to be structurally as solid as Shadow Warrior. Its not and I don't know what all the rave was about this game. If you want a retro looking game that is worth the price, try Gunpoint. There are others that fit into this genre that are around the same price that are also much better.",2.0
"I'm surprised that this has so many good reviews.  The controls are horrible.  It's really the only major issue aside from being kind of a mediocre platformer, but the issue will be huge for people who care a lot about good controls.

"Blade isn't that old a game but it is amazing how uninteresting and uninnovative it is as a game. You expect nowadays that when a game is of the Lara Croft, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake genre that there would be at least a minimum of 1 new interesting feature in the game. E.g. in Spiderman you get to swing from building to building. Very cool. But in Blade you walk, you kill things. That's it. It never really gets more interesting. But you'd expect that at a minimum, Blade's character would have some kind of attitude! Nope- nadda! He's silent as a mouse until he dies. In fact even the zombies have more to say than he does.
Also at the beginning of the game all you get is a pistol. Pardon me for being ignorant but isn't he called BLADE!",2.0

"Whether you've played any game in the Diablo series before (on the computer only until now), this game makes for a great port to the console. I won't detail the mechanics of the game - that's already been done by my fellow reviewers. HOWEVER, IF YOU BUY THIS GAME FOR THE OLDER CONSOLES -PS3 and XBOX 360 - BE AWARE YOU'RE ONLY GETTING HALF THE GAME. That's right, HALF.

Why?  Computer, PS4 and XBox One users will all receive content patches which greatly expand both post-story gaming experiences and loot. As of my writing this, there have been no plans published to give the rest of us this new content.

Try to get through to Blizzard about this. I bet you can't. The only response to everything from help to contact us to emailing corporate offices I've gotten is ""Contact Sony. This is a console issue.""

Sony, however, says to contact Blizzard. And around we go.

So, if you want a basic game with limited Legendary loot, good for some RPG, RTS, and third-person shooter elements that you can play on XBox 360 or PS3, get this. Otherwise, play the game on the PC or a newer console.

Had I known when I purchased this game that I would not get future content patches, which are pretty much game-changers, I NEVER would have bought this for PS3 (or, if I had it, XBox 360). It really feels as though both Blizzard and Sony/Microsoft wanted long-time console gamers to buy this game on our present systems, get us ""hooked,"" and then apply pressure to buy both a new console and then a new copy of the game for the newer console! It really leaves me with a dirty taste in my mouth. And for the record, I've avoided buying a PS4 specifically because it DOESN't have all the features of the PS3, especially backward-compatibility. So you can't play a PS3 copy of this game on a PS4.

If you want to play this game, get it on PC, or on a newer console. DON'T waste your money on it otherwise!",2.0

"Unfortunately, the microphone on mine, when tested on game and voice comm. (Skype for Business), kept going in and out, and the volume changed constantly. People would say I sounded VERY loud, and other times they could not hear me at all. I also found that the mic picks up pretty much everything around you.

These headphones are extremely comfortable though. They feel a bit big for my head, and there's no way to ""lock"" in your size, it adjusts when you put them on. I gave it two star because if a few things on them were fixed and my microphone actually worked, I would probably have kept and used these headphones religiously.

"The Good:
I got this case because it was cheap; after all, why waste the money, right? It holds, as you can see, six NDS game cartridges and your NDS itself, plus one stylus.

The Bad:
This ""travel case"" is actually quite heavy, while the outer shell is hard, the inside rubber is lose and easily bent. This case is actually quite large, too; I'd recommend a travel case either smaller or a general larger case.

The Ugly (No, I'm not kidding):
Prepare for scratches on your system and pinched fingers. There is nothing between your games and DS, so just closing the case causes them to rub, due to it being so compact, and if you try to put something between them (such as a piece of cloth) it will be very hard to close.

I, for one, found my fingers getting pinched, badly, over and over. It sounds like a case of children being clumsy, right? Well the fault is actually in the poor design: the case has a small half circle hallow on the hinge part (my guess would be to enable you to put your finger in the opening to remove the DS when the case is open), but that little hole can quite easily catch on finger pads, no matter how careful one might be. (EG, my case was very stiff, so I had to have fingers behind and thumb on the button to open.)

I finally got tired of bruised fingers and fighting to add extra protection and replaced my case.",2.0

"Was very disappointed in this game. So many good games and yet they give us this. It was like XIV eat up all the money. There was to may eye candy of girl parts and no gamer play. 1 day of play and I got bored and a $60 day now one sets of my shelf. I play 2, 3, and 4 a lot still. it is like they do not care just want your money and go for the next one. The figure your attention span is so you will by the next game anyways. So many crap titles coming out that only last a few days of play at most. Unless your a hard core JRPG collector like me do not waist young time gamer the International THE LAST HOPE. It is worth it. I had the XBOX 360 one and this is much better and looks great in full 1080p Hopefully the will release a 4K version much improved. I want to love this game in just how it looked but I just end up not caring about cause the no plot or character development. Were is a long epic quest. This game is beat in 20 hrs. I want a full out 80 or more. Lots of side quests and making things. This just sucks and the side quest really are annoying. And even more so is the characters you should love and be interested in. This game was just rush and not beta tested it seems. 1 year was all they put into it. It's like they started making a great game then got there funding and people pulled to make the new FF.

"I was really looking forward to playing this but was disappointed to discover the game suffered from a lack of polish in many areas.  Mainly, the painfully slow process of character progression coupled with the insane cost of character upgrades.  The combat is also lacking - you can't ""lock on"" to an enemy and have the camera automatically keep them in view during combat - you have repeatedly take your thumb off the attack button to reposition the camera with the thumbstick to keep your foe in sight, couple that with the slow-to-respond controls & you will quickly become irritated.  Also your attacks are pretty weak until you are able to afford some expensive new moves - which as I already mentioned happens at a snails-pace.  The in-game map system is another nightmare.  When you get to a new area you're pretty much left on your own to wander around trying to find someone who will sell you a map.  Why doesn't the character have the ability to make a map on the fly as you travel and discover new areas?  You'd think being a pirate, map-making would be a skill you'd be well associated with but then again you don't even know how to KICK an enemy until you pay someone to train you to do so.  What?  As a father of 3 I can attest that kicking is a skill most are born with.  Quest logs also are less than helpful, consulting online forum help to figure out what you are supposed to be doing may be frequently required.  Bottom line is this game sounded like such a great concept, but the end product lacks considerably.  If they would have made the character progression part of the game less tedious I could have easily overlooked the rest of the faults.  But as it is, building up your character just takes so long and is so expensive that I just quit caring and put the game on the shelf.  Maybe I'll pick it up again later.",2.0
"I was fairly excited to play Vegas 2 online. At first, the game was exciting, but after a while of play, the faults of the game were just too obvious. This is without a doubt one of the most frustrating games to play online. The blame lies in both the developers and the players. I'll explain the problems further below.

List of my likes and dislikes:

* Customization of your character is fun and exciting. No two players online will be the same. On top of that, you can make custom faces (i.e. your own face) to put in the game. I haven't tried this feature, but just the thought of being able to do so is thrilling. You can customize everything from clothing, armor, and camouflage. A big plus to the developers on this one.

* You unlock new weapons by going through the A.C.E.S. I forgot what it stands for, but I'll explain what it does. The ACES is divided into three categories: Marksman, Assault, and CQC. You add points to each categories based on how you score a kill. After so many points, you gain a level (up to 20 levels per category) within the category and you can either get a new weapon or more experiences toward your overall rank. I thought this was a pretty cool idea, but some of the weapons within each category make no sense. For example, in the Assault category, you mainly score points by using explosives, but yet the weapons within the category have nothing to do with explosives.

* Finding a match online is just flat out frustrating. The lag is nearly unbearable. It seems like the host needs a very good connection in order to host large amount of players. Indeed, the developers can't control this, but I'm guessing they could at least minimize the lag by sending smaller packets.

* You will get kicked and banned a lot in this game. I don't know why too. It just seems like every other game I go in results in me getting kicked or banned. I have a mic, and I usually don't talk.

* Small maps and same respawn points. I'm assuming the developers made the maps so that you play one round then load another map. The problem is most game hosts use unlimited respawns, which sometimes cause losing teams to be stuck at their own spawn point and unable to get out of it while the other team sits and wait for you to come out of your spawn point. You do get a 5 second shield, which makes you invincible for about 5 seconds when you first respawn. Problem is some people are clever enough to wait outside of the spawn point near a door such that your 5 second shield is gone. I would have loved the game if the developers made it smart enough to respawn at another location on the map once the other team overrun the current position.

* Some guns look unrealistic. For example the 92FS looks like it has a huge hole in the center. Other ones look funny enough to me. I thought I was using a supersoaker when I first saw the M468.

Overall, I liked the game. But the flaw of the respawn system and the constant kicking and banning and the unbearable lag makes the game not worthy enough for me to play online. Please don't purchase for the full price. Wait until it becomes 19.99 and get it then. The price and content just don't go together. You pay too much for something that seems broken.",2.0
"The functionality isn't quite there yet, but some of the features are good. You can try to catch pokemon or spin pokestops, or set it to do both. If a pokemon is near a stop, it will always prioritize the pokemon. There are currently some huge flaws with this thing that are inexcusable for the device. It ONLY uses pokeballs, not great or ultraballs. If you run out of pokeballs, it will still light up for pokemon, but you can't do anything. If you are near a pokestop that has a pokemon next to it, this also locks you out of collecting anything from the stop, since it will always prioritize pokemon first and won't let you spin a stop until the pokemon is caught or fled. You can set it to only collect pokestops to help a little bit with this, but it's still a problem. The device is also almost completely incompatible with several phones. It connects fine on my wife's iphone 6, but on my Moto X Pure it has all kinds of problems. You MUST disable wifi, and disable wifi scanning and bluetooth scanning under location services, or else it will never work. Obviously this not only uses more data but also cripples your GPS functionality, often leaving you stuck on ""searching for GPS"" since your phone can't figure out where you are. It also simply doesnt work about half the time, I have to continuously reboot my phone and force stop the app and retry until it finally connects. My understanding is that these connectivity problems exist with all kinds of avoid, so probably best to just avoid this product unless you really really want it.",2.0
"The initial thought of the game seems good enough: trying to break down the all-too-linear approach to first person shooters, and give the player alternative ways to finish off your objectivies. But this is exactly where the game fails. The missions are clearly designed for two specific approaches: (1) Blast your way through (which is remarkably easy) or follow a very fixed stealth route. The first level could be an example. Here you are supposed to assassin an important trial member. You can then either choose to shoot everything that moves, or get on top of a building an snipe the target. Those are basically your two options. And quite frankly, I had expected a much more open gameplay.
The computer A.I. is also horribly bad. On one level, you can easily stand against a corner, shoot two guards that are in the room, and then wait for other guards to come running in and shoot them too (all the time you hardly take a hit). Here's another example: At one point you're supposed to kill a trial leader. After having disguised yourself as a waiter, you attempt to give him a poisened bowl of soup. Unfortunately for the trial leader's bodyguard, he has to taste the soup and ends up dying. There's a cinematic gunfight where the leader escapes. Now here's the thing: after the gunfight, everything returns to normal and all the trial guards in the resturaunt doesn't seem to have noticed anything.
The positive thing about the game are the graphics. The movement of the characters are fairly realistic. I especially like dragging corpses behind me and watch how their bodies bump into furniture and such. If you try dumping a body over a toilet, you'll see how it slumps down the side and falls to rest on the floor. Very nice. The jungle levels are also impressive, with the trees and the plants.
But as they say: gameplay above graphics, and here ""Hitman"" fails miserably.",2.0
"Decent game. Would have enjoyed it more if I had played it before the Xillias. There was a lot of it that I really didn't like. The battle system was watered down, slow, neutered, tedious, unresponsive, the fusion with the Seraphs often made it more difficult to fight, and the artes seemed wholly ineffective. The rest of the gameplay was comparatively lacking as well. The master weapons were garbage, the weapon/armor creation system was more annoying than it was useful. The Lord of the Land system was horrendously slow to level up and was area specific so you'd have to level up the Lord in every area to get the benefits. The character level system was all predetermined, no control.  The storyline was really basic which made it sort of anticlimactic. It wasn't an anticipated denuoment, it was an ""alright, let's get this over with."" The characters were all annoying which made the skits painful. It really just didn't do anything well and all the stuff I liked from previous games was absent.",2.0
"RPG Maker 3 is a software program designed to help newbie coders learn how to make their own adventure game. As you might expect, some people think it is great - and others find it very limited.

Many modern games come with ""level creators"", so most people who are interested in game design have given a try at putting together a level or two. You lay out the rooms, add in textures, add in a few character models and then see how things go. You quickly learn just how much actual work is involved in designing a level that is enjoyable. It's not just about adding halls and doors. It's about designing a world that seems realistic, that is fun to explore, and that provides challenges.

That all being said, the toolset that you use to create your world should be as easy to use as possible. Since designers themselves often use in-house level design tools to create their own game levels, that should make sense. I'm not sure, therefore, why the RPG Maker 3 tools seem so cumbersome.

Yes, the user needs to be able to think in 3D space, and yes they MUST have a keyboard. That's not an unreasonable request if you're typing in dialogue. And yes, the user needs a few memory cards! When I'm doing song creation on my home PC, I have a very large hard drive to work with. I completely expect when I'm designing games on my PS2 that I have a few memory cards to work with, to save variations of my games and keep backup copies.

That all being said, the game tools should be very easy to use, well organized, and easy to see. RPG Maker 3 just doesn't seem to come through on those points. The command sets are not always intuitive. The graphics are not PS2 worthy. And the components ...

You would think the actual components you had to work with would be relatively high quality. But they're not. The textures, character models, sounds, animations, and virtually every other aspect of your ""building blocks"" could really be improved. This is in essence the easiest part of the software product for them to have done right! There are trillions of character models out there in a wide variety of games. Why only provide a few stereotypical ones? PS2 developers have done some amazing things with textures and organic objects. Why give us cheezy low-rez versions? It was really rather surprising the low level of items provided with which to make your game.

I am a developer and I fully realize how hard it is to create a game. I understand that the best games come from learning the actual base level language that the console understands, and to work with that. That being said, I have used MANY level generators for games which are easy to use and which provide amazingly good graphics. Usually those level generators are provided as free bonus items included with a full length regular game. For this RPG Maker to sell as a standalone software product - and to have *poorer* level generation and building blocks - makes little sense to me.

Not Well Recommended.",2.0
"I heard a lot of great things about this game and I was very weary with FF with the last couple of installments. The last FF game in played was 13-2.

I couldn't get into the game and especially couldn't get into the characters, I felt like I was.watching one of my kids shows it just felt very childish.

"Pros:
There are X-Men in this game, Wolverine Iceman and Nightcrawler.
Iceman's levels are pretty good (hence the 2 stars).
The voices of the actors in the movie are used (which may have cost so much is explains the cons).

Cons:
Only 1 decent cutscene in the whole game, and all curscenes are drawn, like moving comic pages, like putting a comic in front of your face and impersonating an X-men character.
Wolverine's levels are poor, he has about 4 different moves ONLY, and he's the worst part of the entire game. Nightcrawlers levels are just frustrating, and should not be played if you are tired of life in any way.
There is no comparison between this game and class games like X-men Legends, they both begin with X, comparison abruptly ends.

You may be thinking ""I love X-Men, I'm buying this anyway.""

"I choose two stars because thats the choice for""I don't like it"". I really really wanted to like this mouse. I use to own the R.A.T. 7 mouse and love the customization of that mouse and the pinky and thumb rests. But the tracking was so horrid i had to sell it. So i saw this mouse and figured i'd give it a try. I had it for three days and considering the price i paid for it i could not hang on to it. Needed to get refunded so i could get a mouse i could actually use. This mouse feels like cheap plastic and not sturdy at all. The R.A.T.7s felt really sturdy and also felt like it was worth the money. Also, because of this being a mouse for both left handed and right handed people, there is no where to comfortably put your ring finger. When you extend it to fit big hands(which i have) the whole mouse rocks when you put your palm on it and does a wheelie. When you take the Wings off and put the plastic normal rubber adjustments on the sides, the wheelie fest kinda ends, But i wanted this mouse for the wings to prevent pinky dragging. I got the software working good and wirelessly it works amazingly, i had no use for the high DPI it came with but it worked great.
Pros:
*Battery life and charger worked great, whenever i was done with my mouse or got up i would just set it on the charger. It magnetically attaches which was awesome!
 *Looks great, great performance and software. Synapse works great!
*Great packaging
*Wireless was awesome to have and worked great!

Cons:
 *No announcements of future upgradeable parts,(like extra adjustment pieces or back replacers) which would be a great idea. Or extra weights for it. But more than likely they will just make another mouse if you want change. therefore you would have to spend another 130 on a mouse.
*Comfort level at a zero
*Really light in weight
Feels like cheap plastic
*Huge gap when extended out
*Rocks and does wheelies which makes sense cause it looks like a bat mobile
In the end amazon was great for doing an easy refund. Delivery was amazingly fast as well. I ended up going with the New Razor Naga Expert MMO mouse, great comfort, big for big hands, easy buttons, and weighs more than The ouroboros as well. Razor did great with the Naga's. These are just my opinions and rants, thanks!",2.0

"Now the game itself is fun, but it has way to many flaws that could have been fixed with a little more effort.

The game has three modes.

Story Mode
Online
Mission

""Story mode"" has basically no story whatsoever, yet Capcom overhyped the story to death, and delivered a weak and empty ""story"" if you can even call it a story.

Online doesn't even have spectator mode, what is the point on having an 8 person lobby, if you can't even see the other matches. At this point it's stupid not to have a feature like this. Supposedly they are working on a patch to fix this, but who knows how long it will take until they take action. The game has been out for about a month now, but we haven't heard nothing regarding an addition of this feature. Ironic how instead of working on something that should have been on the game on release date, they go ahead and start working on 3 different DLC

Mission mode fails short when compared to other mission mode on other current fighting games, even when compared to SSF4 and SF4, which are both from Capcom. You can't even restart the mission (for position) without having to actually press start and go into the menu. There is no demonstration on how the missions should be done, the player is left guessing on the positioning or how to actually perform it. It only shows the name of the moves, instead of showing the input.

Then we go to DLC. The game was released on the February 15 and on the same day they announce DLC costume. Capcom said it would take far too long to make alt costumes which changed the characters figure and decided to make only color swaps, yet they went ahead and on the same day the game was released, they announce DLC costumes that are already locked in the disc. This is not the first time Capcom ever pull something like that, nor will it be the last. Capcom decided to open polls for DLC characters for the future, before the game was even released. Shouldn't they be focusing on fixing the spectators mode?
The two DLC characters (Shuma Gorath and Jill) are already on the disc, yet we still need to pay separately from them.

The actual gameplay of the game is good, but it falls short with all the other flaws this game has.

In short, the game had potential, but it was wasted on a company that did a terrible job with the game.",2.0
Despite the fact that I haven't been one for call of duty for number of years I decided to pick this one up only out of sheer curiosity. Now the whole idea of the outerspace thing was kind of stupid from the get-go but I knew that coming in. I'm also glad that I was able to get this at a reduced price. Because I never would've paid the full price for a game that I was only purchasing to satisfy my curiosity. The level designs are boring story is lackluster the characters are doll and the entire premise is idiotic. I also feel that the main character should not have been that one guy. In my personal opinion the robot Ethan should've been the main player character. I literally only played this once and then stopped. Not since the day of Duke Newcomb forever have I felt that I wasted money . I'm just glad I didn't have to pay full price .,2.0

"Let me start by saying few games will match the Graphics of Alan wake, WOW! The Story isn't so bad either, but it all gets thrown under the bus with annoying cheap combat and doing and picking up the same thing all game long.

It about 98% running in maze in the dark with AI spawning out of the ground with unlimited axes, you must shine your flashlight on them and then shoot them, while you are doing this you are constantly ( I mean like every 2 shots), you are reloading your boring pistol and putting batteries in your flashlight, sound fun,,? This scenario played out after every cut scene. Feels like nothing more than Wack-a-mole. The bodies of course disappear, no blood, just cartoons stuff...and the same bad 1 type of bad AI the whole game..:(

It just got monotonous, doing the same thing over and over and the only thing you pick up is more ammo and flashlight batteries..Whooptido,,

The other thing that disappointed me was this constant delay in the actions, you move control stick forward, it always seems to take a second , like you where in quick sand.

All if this ruined the repetitions game altogether and is a deal breaker, I do not recommend this for purchase! Rent it if you must.

So disappointing, repetitious and boring..Of all the games I played this year this one I was most disappointed by.",2.0
"At its best, the game is a fun shallow experience, at its worse it is an incredibly annoying experience. I gave up on this game after I kept dying during the sky diving mini-game, the mechanics didn't work and the game wasn't worth grinding over. Basically every move you learn in the tutorial will be your entire game experience, there is absolutely no depth in the gameplay. While it's fun at first, it quickly becomes dull and repetitive. Every time you're fighting someone, you have to either jump or slide to start the bullet-time, and each jump/slide is exactly the same. I wish there were some sort of modifiers to add different movements to break up the monotony. Related to this, if you try to shoot when you aren't jumping or sliding, the gun fire-rate is about a 1/4 of the speed, making it useless.

So don't buy this game, if you want to experience it, just download the demo.",2.0
"For anyone that has not played the dismal game burnout paradise this is what it should have been. I have been passing a lot on NFS games coming out lately and I know why now. If I wanted to play burnout I would buy that game but since I don't like burnout I won't waste the money. And last this game doesn't deliver the feel of previous titles plus did I mention that it plays like burnout. The car line up is small, I mean real small! WTH!!! A Porsche cayman as a starter? what happen to the 240xs, the IS's, Sports coupes', etc. The reason I keep playing the series is for these cars. I really don't care how fast you want to make the game but just a ""supercar"" game. Really? I know it seems like I'm bashing the game but ONLY supercars and throwing in a challenger and mustang does not make for ""low-end"" supercar.

The cars slide like bricks, handle like @$$, brake only when ran into something and for crying out loud stop with the exploding cars already! This is the one feature in burnout that kept me from getting into the games to begin with! Don't try drifting when your being chased by the police! Picture this, your drifting down a winding hill and then suddenly, BANG!! You slide right into the guardrail and instead of bouncing a little to stop the drift you explode! Really? Explode on impact?! Granted if I wanted REAL race damage I'll play GT or Forza.

But I get why all of these features are in the game to expand the online game play so I'm leaving my rating as is until I play online but from other reviews that may bring it down a star.

Bottom-line if you  liked NFS at all stay away from this title cause its just BURNOUT 2.5",2.0

"No matter what you've read, this stick is NOT programmable out of the box.  You have to download beta software from Saitek (IF you can find it... I had to get a tech to get me a valid link).  Comfort is only 'ok', maybe because it tries to fit everyone.  Quality is questionable.  I bought this stick based on the Amazon reviews (reviews anywhere else are lacking, I guess that should have been a red flag).  After getting it, I couldn't believe how high the ratings are.  It seems flimsy & cheaply made.  I since found a Youtube video that really pans this stick (just do a search at youtube).  The buttons seem flimsy.  I also saw this stick at a local Fry's and the same button that broke off in the youtube video was broken there as well.  Button positioning is 'ok' but could be better.  I really wanted to like this stick, but with all these issues it's going back to Amazon.",2.0
"After waiting months for this title to ship, I have to say I'm disappointed, no real career mode, and they've gone too far away from the N64 style of control. The camera angle is also horrible, and can not be adjusted. I don't see why many changes would be made to the No Mercy for N64 control style. Dozens of moves at your fingertips with no problem. If its not broken don't fix it. The roster is also outdated, although i know there isn't much that can be done about that. Did I mention the camera angle sucks, good, cause it's really bad.

However, I am extremely disappointed as the reviews and Sentey website and youtube reviews showed a carrying case and nice storage box included. Mine came in a smaller package with no carrying case included. That was a major selling point for me so I feel very mislead about the purchase. I'll keep the headphones, but the reason I purchased this pair over others was the case and box that I didn't actually get.  Also the Bass, center, and rear volume wheels on the controller don't actually do ANYTHING. Even with the OEM software installed.",2.0

Guess Namco was just after the money on this one and they should not have released this game as it but with an original story and lots of new areas not the same ones over and over.

Graphics could be better. They remind me of early PS3 late PS2 graphics. I know what the story is because I had to go online to read it. The upgrade system is cool. The controls are good. It's just the story..... no idea unless I went online to read about it.

"My favorite levels in R6V1 were the casino levels, without that you would have just your typical generic shooter terrain and this is what we have in R6V2, there's absolutely no reason to have Vegas in the name. If you're going to have a ""sequel""(Full Price Expansion Pack) to an amazingly beautiful game like the first one don't let us all down in the same way GRAW2 really blew it with a short storyline and the generic terrain.

I played the first one through many times, this one I don't see playing through more than twice so the value is just not there; like most sequels they get you with the first one and phone it in after that, don't pay full price for this game, you can get the first one for five dollars and get a much better experience. I would not pay more than fifteen dollars for this one.

The many bugs in this game make freezing and CTD a common thing that I just took the whole thing off my computer it was so frustrating. I patched to 1.01 and it was actually crashing more! This game has technical issues as bad as Gears of War did and of course ubi is no help. So avoid this one for a while if you are looking for a smooth game that is worth the price.

The controls are the same as the first one, which worked so well so why change it?

For me the customization is meaningless as I play single player only and to me seems a little tedious with the colors, etc. The weapons are all pretty much the same, one thing I didn't like was the locked weapons and the stupid points system to unlock them, please do this for online only where it makes sense.
It would make more sense to have the advanced weapons available at the more advanced difficulty settings during the single player campaign.

In sum Ubisoft and the R6V team really let us down with this one and don't reward them by rushing to buy this , even if you loved the first one and have waited anxiously for a sequel like me.

"It takes over 30 hrs of game play to be able to select your team. Then I hit Barthandelus boss and I am stuck. Did I say this game has some extra hard bosses, it losses the fun factor big time. It has come to the point of almost being ridiculas and I don't patenece to fight a boss twenty or so times to get it just right so I can move on in the game. I will try several more times and it will be history and trade it in before it losses any more value, that is how frustrating this can get! Then Square Enix is off my must buy list.

Starts out with a breathtaking video and the game just looks great (PS3). But pretty graphics don't make for a great game.
Did I say this game looks great, yes it does and the Battle System grows on you, but still not as good as FF XII. It is very linear unlike FF XII and if you don't beat a certain boss your stuck unlike 12 where you could go level up some more on other side quests and come back.

Graphics aside FF XII was a much better game. This is a edit from my first one and I give it a 2 for fun.",2.0
"I have played previous Total War titles and this one was not really what i expected. It has some good features but its mostly overshadowed by the bad.

The good( some may be in previous more recent total war titles as well):

*The best thing i noticed is the nice graphics both for the campaign map and the battle maps. The sea battle maps and ships are stunning to look at. The normal battle maps have a lot of detail.

*Naval Battles now are actually naval battles. You can control the ships on a sea map just like the armies on a land map.

* More Theaters of action. 3 theaters is a nice addition.

* Various other minor enhancements

Cons:

* My biggest problem is probably with Steam. It is required to play the game regardless of if you buy the digital or retail box. After the 15 GB install which is  still rather slow on even my high end pc i had to wait about 5 hours(@100 kb/s average speed) for manadatory patching through Steam, rather than including a simple autopatcher with the game like most decent game publishers do. I could not play it without this lengthy patching. Also i dislike Steam for a couple of reasons: A) i consider it to be malware. I am forced to use it to play the game and it does gather info from your pc. I am not for sure exactly all what it gathers but considering i am forced to have it on my pc to use the game  it makes me not trust steam at all on their data gathering. And B) off a retail box game at full price ( usually $50) their is 15% profit for the developer/publisher. Off a Steam Download which charges the same full retail price, that profit margin  is 60%!. So by using steam these publishers get mega profits and we customers get mega ripped off.

* Playing medieval total war then this, the game land battles seem harder to control. Both on the camera( i have changed my camera settings several times to try to correct the feel) and the units themselves.

* The Sea battles are not that easy to control. Sometimes the ships  won't do what they are told the first time. Also wind plays a major factor in manuevering and it seems to be working against you and for the AI  most of the time.  Overall the sea battles are ok and still a nice addition though.

* Many things are simplified  from  MTW such as city building, research, and various details that use to be available on your ""leaders"" from the king down to the leader of a group of units. Much of this has been done away with.

* Modders had to create mods to make up for the developers lack of putting out a complete game. even after the patches the game wasn't all it should of been. Modders fixed the AI, made various things more realistic, and added some enhancements. things the developer should  of done. I highly recommend Darthmod  if you play empire total war.

* some of the text is hard to read and blurry. Changing my resolution or settings does not seem to effect this.

Neutral:

*It is reported that the game is buggy and crashes a lot. I have never had it crash in 20 hours of play. I don't notice any major bugs so far  though it does sometimes feel a bit unfinished and rushed out the door.

* This game can be a resource hog. So on lower end pcs you may have some performance issues.

*the city building is more simpilified. Now your focus is the region capital  and  various little settlements pop up and grow in a region  as you progress.  You actually watch the land in the game ""grow up"". While this is interesting it leaves less to manage( and to alter your income) early in the game. So its really a trade off. What you build in the cities now seems more simple. Their is not actually a lot of building and  at various points you have choices of following  different ""trees"" of buildings(ie: shipyards or trade port?). It adds a twist but does take other elements away from the game.

* their are some nice ""defensive"" features but they don't seem to work well. they had great potentional but kind of fell short. They are still  playable and whatnot but could of been better.

Overall: If you player previous total war games you are probably going to be a bit disappointed. the graphics and sea battles are going to be the biggest change( besides the forced steam use). Its alright but nothing like the TWs you have played as far as gameplay.

If you are new to the TW series i recommend starting with earlier  and better versions. This title really doesnt do the series justice and is a poor example of a game from the series.

For reference my pc specs: Intel i7 -8xx series, 8 GB DDR 3 Ram, 1 GB nvidia GT220  video card, 7.1 surround sound, 1 TB raid 0 HDD. I can play the game on ultra settings without darthmod and on high settings with darthmod though large battles are a bit laggy using darthmod in large battles on  very high settings. Also i am using 1600x900 resolution.",2.0

You CANNOT open this and fix it.

"Many have already written on this game, so I'll try to avoid repeating what they've said, but ultimately, this game starts out strong and entertaining enough, but settles into a middle-ground groove that's neither bad, nor great, but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on.
The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable, but not too convincing -- you can tell it's not Harrison Ford.
And unsurprisingly, it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end, Indiana gets the Asian (i.e. Chinese) girl, even though there's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with.

"I want to be clear first off, I really enjoyed the story in this game. The character choices and the way it plays out is quite well done in my opinion. However, the lag spikes during crucial moments in the game are really a killer (sometimes literally). At first it wasn't so bad, but as you go further into the game it gets worse and worse. I ended up googling this issue and apparently it's been reported since launch and Telltale games just didn't seem to care. To me this is very unfortunate and it's why I am giving it a 2-star review. If this was a new game and this happened, I'd be a little more understanding and just wait for a patch. Unfortunately it seems that there is no patch on the way, and Telltale will just move on to season 2. For the record, I purchased the walking dead vita bundle on Amazon, so the version I had was downloaded from the playstation network. It is possible that the hard copy version does not have these issues, but I wasn't able to tell for sure. I suggest perhaps just playing the PC version or something, as it is a very good story line (albeit a tad on the short side). These lag issues have been reported on the xbox 360 and ps3 versions as well, but I cannot attest as to whether those have been fixed or not. Good luck and happy gaming!",2.0
"Star Wars Battlefronts reskinned. Wash, rinse, repeat. Already returned.",2.0
"The Sims: Bustin' Out is a goal-oriented, console-style version of The Sims. The gameplay has been slightly watered-down, and given a more simplistic feel. Really, I think Bustin' Out was aimed at a somewhat younger audience.

The concept of the game is fun, however. You create your own 'sim' and control them in order to accomplish goals, make friends, and earn money. (To furnish your home with.) The game starts you out on your uncle's farm, where you become familiarized with some of the gameplay mechanics. Afterwards, you are sent out to explore SimValley, and meet its various denizens. From there, you will stumble upon various goals and will be required to fulfill them before moving on. After completing every goal in every chapter, you finish the game.

Unfortunately, it seems that the game was either rushed, or under-funded, as the graphics are not as up to par as they should be. In addition to this, there are several glitches which can cause certain goals to become unavailable, or incompletable. (Thus ruining any chance of actually finishing the game.) There seems to be no way around these glitches, either.

After having completed the game myself, I was sorely disappointed with the rewards of having done so. However, I will not spoil it for those who've yet to finish the game themselves. Regardless, I do think the gameplay is fun, in its own right. You won't find much entertainment in actually completing the game itself, though. Otherwise, I would recommend trying The Urbz: Sims in the City instead of Bustin' Out.",2.0

"I'm a fan of the Professor Layton series.  I had never played a Phoenix Wright game, and honestly, after this, I don't think I'm likely to try one.  I was initially enthused by the idea of a law/logic game, and I thought this crossover would be a great way to sample it.  However, the Phoenix Wright sections were frustrating.  Also, apparently, it's a ""thing"" in the PW series to flash the screen periodically, and I found that annoying and distracting.  I initially thought my game had a bug, but after searching, I discovered it's an aesthetic choice.  (It happens during the PW sections and the Layton sections, perhaps as part of the crossover effect.)

The PW gameplay is repetitive and foolproof, the latter being a bad thing.  You literally cannot mess those sections up.  It just forces you to go through the sequences over and over again until you figure out what it wants you to do.  While it's often painfully obvious what you should do in those sections, it can also be painful and difficult, but not in a good way.  It's difficult because sometimes the conclusion is not clear or the game skips over some contradictions in favor of others.  It's painful because you are forced to listen to testimony at least twice, even if you figure it out perfectly, and you're often forced through it 3-4 times to determine when you need to take action.  Without spoiling anything, there's several places where the ""contradictions"" are perfectly clear, but trying to figure out when and how the game wants you present them is painful.

PW's little parenthetical thoughts are also annoying.  Too often, he's recapping what someone just said, which just feels like an unnecessary screen to click through.  Speaking of unnecessary click-through, if I have to click through multiple characters saying "".........."" one more time, I'll throw the game across the room.  There is NO OPTION to speed up the text or get through it faster.  You just sit and hammer the A button, because you can read it as fast as it will display.  But then, you can't even just do that because periodically, it'll throw a choice in there, and hammering the A button means you'll select one of the choices (whichever is default) and possibly ""lose respect"" with the judge.  Who cares though, because the game literally will not let you lose.  It gives you so many ""lives"" that you cannot possibly mess it up, and it often just forces you to replay if you make the wrong call (or forces you to sit through Maya telling you what to do).

The initial part of the game, which was Layton focused, perhaps set my expectations too high.  The 3D effects shine as you search through London.  Layton's puzzles also work well in 3D, though I would have loved to see one or two that actually used or depended on the 3D effect. (I suppose they can't do that without breaking the game for people who can't really play in 3D.)  I found the puzzles generally more easy than I'm used to from a Layton game, and that made me suspect they watered down the challenge of both characters to make it approachable for people unfamiliar with it.  Part of the joy of a Layton game, though, is being teased by a really brainbending puzzle and fighting the urge to use a hint coin.  I feel like perhaps they did a disservice to both genres by diluting them.",2.0

"Pros
- The game looks cute and plays smoothly.
- No season pass/paid DLCs. Supposedly future additions will be free, although some kind of micro-transaction still exists.

Cons
- No single player, multiplayer-only.
- Repetitive generic shooter, nothing new, nothing exiting beyond the cute graphics, some of the weapons may give a fresh air the first couple hours. Tries to ""innovate"" with a few features like characters specials/abilities, no health regen, etc.
- Four simple game modes based on capturing areas/points, that's all you get, no attempt to create new and/or innovative game modes... oh, my bad, three game modes, the fourth is just a mix of the others.
- 10-12 players matches (yes, like it's 1995).
- Three maps for each mode, for a grand total of 12. Maps are small obviously as they just need to accommodate 10-12 player, don't expect Battlefield-sized maps.
- No customization beyond skins and aesthetic.
- No additional weapons, mods, gadgets to unlock. All maps and characters are unlocked from the start. Has a level system that only unlocks said aesthetics, that is: a completely useless level system.
- Ridiculous unbalanced characters, some will one-hit-kill you with their specials (some even with their standard weapons), others do so little damage their bullets/lasers just tickle the enemy. Unbalancing gameplay is expected form Blizzard though, ask any Starcraft 2 player.
- You will be bored after 5 hours of capturing the same area over and over. The only incentive to keep playing is to unlock the aesthetics and to ""master"" that one-hit-kill special from your character so you can get your cheap free kill from unsuspecting players.

This is the ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" from Blizzard: severely lacking in content, rushed, unpolished, unbalanced, over-hyped, quick-cash-grab game; but strangely this one gets praised.",2.0
"Build quality feels very very cheap, like if I drop it on anything but carpet it will just shatter in a horrible plastic mess. And the triggers are very imprecise, sometimes it would say I clicked it, sometimes it wont, you need to hit the very edges of the triggers for it to register, if you hit the center, nothing will happen, which is really bad since I got this for FPS games and if your trigger doesn't work the instant you press it, your completely out of luck. The cord is nice and long which is good since this is a wired only controller, but really the controller is definitely not worth the price for the cheap and just overall bad quality.",2.0

"Aside from amazing graphics, it's a step down from past iterations of the game

In the main mode Mega Battle random power mushrooms drop on screen giving you temporary power boost as your character grows in size. This is very annoying as it seems more like luck than actual skill as the person who randomly gets the powerup is way too overpowered and will dominate the match if one or two (in case of doubles) do not also get it making everything seem one-sided.

Luckily you can play Classic Tennis where there are no power ups making the game more fair, but with no tournament or campaign mode you'll get bored easily. The only reason to own this game in my opinion is if you have roommates who like to play competitively every night in this mode, other than that it's a bust.

There's also a mode called Mega Ball Rally where you just rally a large ball back and force to see how many times you can rally the ball back and forth at increasing speed for a high score. This is not a traditional rally as the cpu thinks it's an actual tennis match and will try to screw you over when doing combos. Also the only way to get a high score is to avoid any power ups and keep doing flat shots in hopes of the cpu isn't dumb enough to get hit by the ball.

All characters unfortunately play the same, and the only reason you select one over the other is that one looks better and/or is your favorite character in the series. It's not like Mario Power Tennis for the Game Cube where there's special moves for each character. There's a slight difference between the speed and power type characters during higher level play, but doesn't really matter if power ups are involved.
There's Knock Out Mode where you play against a series of cpu like arcade mode in a fighting game and train your amiibo. I don't get why you can import your mii and upgrade his/her stats that would make more sense in my opinion...guess Nintendo wanted to focus on implementing amiibo in this game instead.

Online mode is okay if not non-existent, the bad thing is if you want to play your friends online you have to log on the same time and hope the server groups you two together as there's no match making whatsoever which doesn't make any sense since the 3DS game Mario Tennis Open had it. Luckily there's no one online so if you can coordinated log in times then you'll almost be guaranteed matchups.  Also if you want to play doubles with no couch partner, the amiibo you trained will in knockout mode will be your partner.

There is an achievement system where you can unlock up to 25 badges after completing set tasks in the game like play 10 standard classic matches to get Bowser Jr. If you're a veteran to the series all 25 badges can be unlocked in a few hours.

Visuals are very impressive..and that's all it got going for it as this game is very bare bones. There very little substance as the lack of modes is very disappointing, if you care more about gameplay and variety of gameplay modes then I suggest getting an older game in the series as this game seems like a rush job by Nintendo.",2.0

"These are a so so budget headset but there are some issues that prevent me from rating these higher.
First I do want to say the mic quality is pretty good but I did have to turn the level all the way up to 95% to be heard in Team Speak and recording in OBS was difficult because I always sounded too low for my liking.
The Ear cups do a good job blocking out noise however they don't breath well and it makes it uncomfortable after about 30 minutes or so.
The sound quality is generally ok but I did have times where I would get a strange static and popping noise when using these.  It would be at very random times and I could never pinpoint what caused it.
The reason I keep speaking in the past tense is because I have already replaced these.  Not by far the worst Headset I've used but not something i could recommend.  If you can put another $10 to $15 into a headset, I would look into one of the offerings from Kingston or Corsair.",2.0

"Despite it advertising better modeling than MS Flight Simulator, it doesn't feel like it. Controls are twitchy and overly sensitive (even after hours of fiddling) and planes that should be dead-on in ""feel"" are nowhere near it. Why, for example, does the 172 get pushed and turned around on the runway by a 10 knot quartering head wind without the brakes on? It is absurd. Such a thing does not happen in FSX and it doesn't happen in real life.

The feel and rate of controls (trims etc.) between different planes are too varied to be able to consistently expect anything and everything is always a surprise. The biggest problem is that even a plane like a Beech 1900D feels like a kite in the simulator, and it's no fun hand-flying anything smaller than a 737 in IMC. This simulator may be good for the lower-end commercial simulation market, but it needs tons and tons of work for it to be anywhere near as useful as FSX was on the desktop.

And of course, there are no missions. What made FSX a lot of fun is the missions and add-on packs available. There is no such animal in X-Plane and it shows. It lacks the adventure.",2.0
"The Game could have been OK but the controls do not respond quickly nor accurately.  Game constantly is interrupted for curt scenes.  I mean constantly as every time you finish a scene it seemed.
Controls are added as the game progresses but the controls are something like push square twice then circle?  How is that suppose to work unless the fist part of the sequence is delayed to wait for the second part.  Hence slow control input reaction.  They just keep  adding more and more of that kind of control as the game progresses.  I couldn't even get one complex sequence to work although sometimes it seemed to do it by itself as when I meant only to use the single control it strung them together  from previous moves instead.

Don't let the pictures and hype fool you.  There is almost nothing sexy about this game.  For one thing the graphics are too poor.  For another she looks like a barbie doll (not anatomically correct).  There are almost no scenes that allude to the sexiness and almost no conversations or innuendos or double meanings.  This is kind of strange since the Japanese are usually right on the ball about that kind of stuff.

"Please note: I have never played a samurai warriors title before. And I have only played this one for about four hours so far. That said, I tend to enjoy JRPGs more than most Americans, so I was surprised by how much this game bothered me.

Samurai warriors: Chronicles was the first 3DS game I bought. I am usually more of a ""hardcore"" gamer, so games like Steel Diver and Pilotwings resort from the 3DS launch lineup did not appeal to me. This one looked fun. And it is somewhat fun - if you can stomach the hours of horrible story before you actually kill anything. Seriously, expect to spend at least 30 minutes listening to bad story at the start of the game before you get to do anything at all... and this trend repeats for every. single. mission. UPDATE: I was recently informed by a commenter who timed it that there is exactly seven minutes of story before you can play. It just feels like a half hour. I stand by my statement that the introduction is painfully long for a handheld.

The story might not be so bothersome if they bothered to localize it into English. They have voice actors, but they are all speaking Japanese. The cutscenes contain zero action or anything exciting, so I found myself spamming the A button while doing something else for 30 (excuse me, 7) minutes waiting to be able to play the game. Seven minutes of non-playable story might be okay for a console, but it is too much for a handheld.

Once you actually begin a mission, you will find some fun(ish), hack-and-slash style combat where you get to attack hordes of enemies with big swords. There is a loot and leveling system that keeps the game somewhat interesting. Except none of the items seem to make a significant difference in your gameplay. And the controls are unresponsive at best - I really never got the hang of what I was supposed to be doing with the R or A buttons. Each character has different abilities, but I have no idea what they do. Perhaps this was explained in the cutscenes that I skipped, but I doubt it.

The game is very fast paced, with frequent side-missions coming up. Which brings me to my next gripe about the localization. This game is played on a system with two screens, so you are already looking at two places. The top screen is 3D, which means that there is a lot to see on that screen. But every time a character says anything (often useful tips about where you need to go next), you have to read the subtitles because the developers were too lazy (cheap) to hire a localization team. So you're looking at the top 3D screen, the bottom screen, and trying to figure out what you are supposed to do, all at the same time because you have NO IDEA what anyone is saying. I know some people do not like voice actors because they tend to sound really cheesy, but they are really required for gameplay here. I would strongly prefer some very bad voice acting to this alternative.

Seriously, Koei, I cannot stress this enough: you NEED to hire English voice actors for these games! For the cutscenes it is just a bothersome nuisance, but for the gameplay I actually felt hindered because I do not speak Japanese. I know Samurai Warriors games are much more popular in Japan, and the reason seems incredibly obvious to me.

Graphics: 9/10 (very nice looking 3D for a launch title, although it provides little tactical advantage like most 3D games)
Gameplay: 5/10 (fun, fast-paced hack-and slash hindered by awkward controls)
Story: 0/10 (it's painful. really, really painful, and WAY too long. This is why Americans do not like JRPGs)
Overall: 4/10

"I've been playing Civilization for over a decade, all the way back to Civ I. I excitedly buy  each installment of the series hoping ""this-time"" they'll get it right. But each time so much energy is put into graphics and bells and so little is changed to make the game more than a mind-numbing waste of time (this from a guy who has spent hundreds maybe thousands of hours playing the games). I loose interest because all the wonderful subtlety constantly goes out the window with the inevitable surprise attack from a 3rd rate civ from the other side of the world. Each game becomes just another race to get the techs that lead to the best guns.

The diplomacy is only marginally better than Civ 2. Trade and trade routes (the most significant motivator in human history) is, and always has been, pathetic. It's still handed like spoiled kids trading snacks at lunchtime. ""I'll give you my Twinkie for your coal.""  Religion is an interesting addition but it's used in such a benign way it does little to change the game. The great-leaders seem exciting at first but it quickly becomes apparent they are little more than anonymous ""bonus cards"" that show up occasionally.  While the graphics are at first impressive, the game really dissolves into endless tedious hours pushing little animated soldiers around the screen.

There is still no storyline. No random events to keep it interesting. Still nothing to distinguish unique cultures beyond graphics and special units. The AI leaders act predictably hostile and uncooperative. There is no romance in the game. I don't mean royal arranged marriages, I mean the thrill you get watching that online ad narrated by Martin Sheen. There is no epic sweep that could so easily be there if the authors spent less time animating little sprites you ignore by the third game, and more time adding true personality. It needs heroes and revolutionaries, pirates and brigands, disasters and surprises. Add real trade routes and the need to provision ships and caravans. That would make the map actually strategic instead of just a pixel battlefield.
How about colonies and revolutions? New civs that appear over time? How `bout leaders that change over time? It's so stupid to be negotiating with FDR in 3000 BC.  There are so many things that could be added to make the game more interseting and dynamic not just pretty to look at.
But sadly even in Civ 4, Each game is very like the last, only the map really ever changes--from game to game or version to version.

Like the three versions before, Civ IV is over by end of the bronze age. If you aren't the undisputed top dog by 1AD you might as well cash in your chips. Except for war, there is no real unpredictability in the game.  War wouldn't be so bad except it's so tediously long. On this game's calendar Ike would have landed in Normandy in 1999, only a few years after Napoleon finally got back from Moscow. And frigates are still able to sink battleships, and your tanks still burst into flames attacking Knights.

I'm always so hopeful loading in the newest version of Civilization. But yet again I am disappointed. After all these years, it's still little more than a cross between Sim City and Risk.",2.0

"Blah! I know I'll end up with a 0/955 helpful ranking, but I just have to comment. I'm sorry, but I don't understand why this game was/is such a hit. Sure, it has great graphics and music (which is why it gets the extra star), but other than that...
The storyline is very complex. Apparently you have to get some metal gear pictures before the russians come or something. These cutscenes, as stated in previous reviews, take FOREVER. Half the time you don't even know what they're talking about, and you don't want to skip over it for fear you might miss something important. Then when it's finally time to actually PLAY the game, BAM! Horrid camera angle. Oh, and believe me, you don't get too far before you end up with another cutscene. And so goes the game.

All it seems in this is you're riding a freaking horse all the time, firing boring guns, and whoopee I get to shoot a deer every now and then.

"I absolutely loved Red Factions I and II, so imagine my great disappointment to discover that Red Faction Guerrilla is NOT a First Person Shooter (FPS) at all!
This to me is a HUGE disappointment. Plus it feels like a console port: There is a ""custom"" option for controls, but I did not find any way to actually remap any of the keys. I found this to be sloppy programming on the part of Volition Inc! Also I am really getting annoyed with ""Games for Windows Live"" (GFWL) When I want to play a game, I want to jump into it immediately, and having to start GFWL first just really irritates me.

However, I have only played the game for about 30 minutes, so hopefully my first very bitter impression will get better if I overcome the ""Third Person View"" that just does NOT work for me! I am willing to give it a try, though, because I ended up liking Max Payne I and II a LOT, and they were Third Person View.

"The charging stand comes with two small dongle with narrow connectors that are placed upon each controller. The controllers are then placed upon the stand. There are no catches to hold the controllers in place so any little movement can dislodge them. If they are placed in a certain way charging does occur, but that position seems to vary with each attempt. There are two controller shaped lights on the front that light up when the controller is charging. Unfortunately they go off when the controller is fully charged, or if the controller is not in the right position. So you have the fun task of determining if the lack of a light means a fully charged controller ready to go or a fully drained controller that didn't quite make contact with the charger.

"The game has potential, but this unfinished mess has a serious uphill climb that and it certainly isn't worth $60 in my opinion.  I don't even care about the multiplayer aspect, rather the lack there of.  I am talking about the bugs, glitches, and the large universe of mediocre gameplay.  Where to start?

Bugs I have repeatedly experienced would be a good place.
1: crashing on the initial loading screen so hard that the only way I can reset the console is by unplugging it.  Holding the PS button doesn't bring up the dashboard and holding the power button does nothing.
2: landing my craft just to have it crop through the ground into an underground cave.  This usually result in a horribly maimed ship at the very least upon takeoff.
3: can't land in a meadow with some rocks on the ground beneath me but I can land on the peak of a mountain where the drop is instadeath after I run out of jetpack.
4: push R2 to take off, but it launches me into space at warp speed causing me to lose my bearings on that unmarked location I was planning to visit.  More of a nuisance than a game breaking bug, but it happens so much that it ruins ship exploration.
*Edit*
5: I, too, have experienced cropping through the ground and getting stuck.  It happened after I investigated a crash site and swapped ships.  The crashed ship's nose was cropped in the ground and after I had repaired the thrusters I hopped in the ship not realizing I hadn't repaired the engines.  Didnt have the materials on me either.  Jules out and presto, trapped below the ground and it saved that way.  I had 2 saves available though, so I had to use my earlier save to fix the issue.  Possible fix for those that  have something similar happen.

Now, for general annoyances:
1: you'll spend more time harvesting fuel resources for your shields and mining laser than you do anything else.  Who knew plutonium was such a poor source of energy and titanium was such a weak material?
2: space combat sucks.  Don't try to dog fight, you'll lose because you won't be able to keep track of the AI ships.  Just stop (as much as you can), rotate to them and shoot them as they come in for another shot, it's that easy.
3: sentinel drones EVERYWHERE.  I understand this was an attempt to present some sort of challenge, but it gets old shooting those things after a while.  Sorry I destroyed those predator creatures, but they were trying to eat me.  Now I have to deal with sentinels...
4: landing is a pain.  I usually find myself pressing square and hoping for the best.
5: can't stop your ship.  You can slow way down when you are within an atmosphere, and you can go in reverse in space, but you cannot actually stop your ship's propulsion, anywhere.  Really makes it a pain farming larger asteroids

That's a long enough list of the cons.  I shouldn't need to list of the game's potential, read the other reviews, they are basically all right in pointing out it's strong suits.  It is a fairly unique concept.  I just wonder how much they really tested this game and how they released it with the glaring bugs.  I can live with the annoyances, to an extent, but those bugs...  and anyone who plays long enough will most likely start experiencing them, whether they will admit it or not.  I get it that it's a small dev team, but they pushed it back before because it wasn't finished.  Why sell a game that should be in beta with a finished AAA sales tag?  $60 is too much for this game, because you are giving $60 to test a game that may never be the finished product you expect.",2.0
"I played this many years ago (2002) when it was first released and got stuck about midway thru the game on a mission where I kept getting mowed down by a machine game nest in an alley. I got tired of repeating that level over and over ad nauseam and I stopped playing.

Last week (2015), looking for some single-player FPS action on my trusty old PS2, I decided to revisit this game on NORMAL difficulty. The controls are completely wonky. NO sensitivity settings? WTH? The character moves way too slowly when moving and aiming. Now I know why I put it down many years ago.

EXAMPLE: Early in the game, my character was trapped in a corner with absolutely no escape. Maybe I can jump? Nope. Move left, right, forward, backward? Nope. I'm stuck. Hard. I had to reset the level. In the submarine mission, I was continually spraying the same narrow corridor with a German MP40 submachine gun and I had to unload 2 clips just to kill 5 Nazis. Gee, I had no idea machine guns were so bloody ineffective on enemy soldiers at close-range. LOL. I kept getting mowed down over and over again by the same 5 Nazis with no escape and no defilade while my character slowly reloaded his heavy duty NERF gun. Hurry up, grandpa! I made it thru at least 4 times with only a drop of life left, only to be mowed down again in another narrow corridor farther on up the road by another 5 Nazis with still no defilade and no effective close-range weapon. By the 5th and 6th try my character's view snapped up at the ceiling and started to spin around and around and around while those dirty Kraut sailors annihilated me. Stuck again? Staring up at the ceiling? WTH? NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE! I guess the generals forgot to supply me with some Dramamine before I got on this crazy U-boat. LOL. Forget it. Who's got the time when I could be playing something fun. This game is an exercise in futility. Shameful beta testing.

I had no problem beating MOH 1 & 2 on the old PS1 and had a great time playing those games. But, this franchise was ruined when they made this wonky MESS the 3rd game in the MOH platform series. Unless you're a glutton for punishment stay far far away. If you have to play it, set it on EASY. That's what I'm doing now just to rip thru it and see what the rest of it looks like. (ARGH! I just shot Wernher von Braun with the sniper rifle 3 times in the head and he won't go down. He's still scribbling rocket fuel formulas on his little pad. I guess the generals gave me blanks because they want to use him at the end of the war. lol. PAINFUL.)

They say that WAR is HELL, but this game is like being stuck in PURGATORY!

It gets 2 stars for the level design, weapons choice, weapons sound effects, soundtrack, and the dying Nazi animations. Everything else about this game is just plain awful.

If you need a break from all the multiplayer FPSs on the newer platforms and you're looking for a great old single-player FPS experience for your good old PS2, get BLACK (superior) or KILLZONE (great). Those games ROCK!

This game SUCKS a Nazi Potato Masher!",2.0
"Do you like button mashing games? Games where you repeatidly press the same button over and over until the next level? If so then you will like this game. The game is similar the nintendo 64 version but has added many more levels and characters. The game is one to four players. The game is at it's best when you are playing with four of your buddies, but if you are playing by yourself it gets very repeditive and well boring.
  The graphics aren't that great and well if you didn't know this was the Gamecube version you would think that you were playing the 64. Also it is very frustrating when you just miss two or three gems and you don't know where. The people at Midway looks like they just rushed through this game to get it done.
  There are good things about this game. There are a few good things about this game. The levels and all the different combinations and weapons will keep you playing for a while. My advice is unless you love these kind of games I would just rent it. I don't think it is worth purchasing.",2.0
"I haven't played a new Mario game since Super Mario 64, and my experience with that game left me feeling like it was an unexceptional and overrated game, with the biggest complaint being there were simply WAY too many empty areas throughout the game resulting in too much pointless roaming around to do.  Lack of enemies severely hurt Super Mario 64.

Well, more than 12 years later, I'm now playing Super Mario Galaxy that I received for Christmas... and uh oh.  The same exact problems I experienced with Super Mario 64 have returned, and in most likelihood, those problems probably never even left in the first place (so I'm definitely not kicking myself for ignoring every new Mario release over the last several years).  It appears like I didn't miss anything special about the Mario series at all the last 10 years.  Unless utter disappointment and frustration qualifies as special?  Didn't think so.

The number one biggest complaint with Super Mario Galaxy is that it's VERY hard to control Mario's movements.  You think I'm terrible at video games?  Guess again- I've been playing video games for over 20 years and learned to deal with a variety of different movements, many of which were *really* downright confusing and discouraging (such as a fair share from the NES console for example) but nothing has EVER given me as much frustration as this game has.

First of all, Mario doesn't move with *nearly* as much speed as he did in the older Mario games, and in fact, there's not even a run button.  Why is this?  I have no earthly idea.  When you take away the speed, you inadvertently take away the crucial element of ""fun"".  Simple as that.

Furthermore, a lot of times the camera pans out so you can barely even SEE where Mario is going, or what Mario is even doing!  This results in a *lot* of unfair, cheap and untimely deaths.  It's ridiculous that I keep falling over the edge (and into that huge orange/black spinning black hole of instant death that constantly lurks below) simply because I can't see what Mario is doing.

Oh, and no- it's NOT my television screen either.  It's perfectly fine.  My eyes are fine too.  The fact that Mario's movements are so slow and stiff also contributes to many unnecessary deaths.  This is NOT why I fell in love with the Mario series back when I had an NES and Super NES either.  Had Super Galaxy been my first exposure to the series, I would have thrown the game in the trash after giving it 5 solid hours of my precious time.

I wish the movements were as precise and fluid as the ones found in the Spyro the Dragon series, specifically the *original* Spyro the Dragon series that appeared on the Playstation One console.  That particular series did 3D movements perfectly, not to mention it was a heck of a lot more fun running around collecting gems, completing mini games, interacting with many unique characters, and checking out more interesting/creative environments than the ones included here.

Certain objectives later on in Super Mario Galaxy require *exact* movements in order to complete, and if you're off just a tad, you will fall to your death over and *over* again.  It's quite annoying, and to be completely honest -despite what people think- even the hardest of the old-school 2D Mario games such as Lost Levels and Yoshi's Island were significantly less frustrating than this.  At least I knew what I did wrong when I died in the older games, and learned from it next time.  There's no learning here- you either land safely or you don't.  Not much in the way of a learning curve.

Oh, and those levels where you're positioned on top of a huge clear rolling ball and forced to use the Wii remote to steer it around correctly are, in my opinion, the biggest annoyance I've EVER had to deal with in a video game.

Overall, do NOT buy this game for your kids-  Super Mario Galaxy was designed in a way that requires gaming skills of near perfection.  If you don't have the patience to perfect your skills, surprise surprise- this game will have you throwing your Wii remote/Nunchuk at the TV screen countless times.  That's a promise.",2.0

The main idea is to log online with up to four friends and chat with them as you kill monsters, unlock doors, find rare weapons, and blow up boxs!!!

"Stunning graphics coupled with very clumsy controls make this game a feast for the eyes but a major bust when it comes to engrossing game play.  In a  world dominated by such near master works as Lucas Arts' Indiana Jones and  the Infernal Machine, different is not necessarily better and the third  person perspective Nocturne offers is as creepy as the games beautifully  dark images and spine tingling story line.  I suppose the object was to  give Nocturne a cinematic edge offered by some of Hollywood's best  horror/thrillers, but cutting from place to place using numerous movie  angels as our gruff but hardly lovable anti-hero ""Stranger"" runs through  each scene (ground level, over-head, etc) trying to mow down swooping and  snarling creatures of the night, simply doesn't work here and would likely  earn any film student a solid D for effort!  With one additional option,  first person perspective (or even second person), this might have been a  great game, without it, Nocturne swiftly becomes little more than a tedious  test of your 20/20 vision and manual dexterity.  Bottom line, if you can  get it cheap (one major home electronics store recently had it on sale for  $9.99), or can borrow it from a friend, check it out for it's amazing  cutting edge eye candy.  But just like any fine work of art hanging in  some posh museum, you'll pause to consider Nocturne's brilliant textures,  along with it's use of light and shadow but eventually you'll move on to  something much more stimulating and rewarding, like an amusement park.",2.0

"This game is similar (and I mean really really similar) to the first Metroid Prime, except even more annoying.

The translation of style from sidescrolling Metroid to 3d was handled beautifully.  Art, sound, level design, etc is all top notch, and the game sports some of the most impressive visuals to be found on the gamecube.  Beyond aesthetics though, the game falls apart.

It's simply not fun to play.  It has a somewhat awkward control scheme that even after you adjust to, is simply subpar to games that were being made in the N64 era.  Nentendo tries to say that this is not a ""First Person Shooter"", but a ""First Person Adventure"" game.  Well, you do occasionally have to shoot things in the first person perspective, and it's handled quite poorly, leading me to believe Nintendo's statement is really just a euphimism for ""Bad First Person Shooter"".

As already mentioned, the control scheme is poor.  You cannot strafe and move at the same time (unless you're locked onto someething that moves your view while you're strafing), so enemies (the vast majority of which are extremely agile) can very easily get behind you.  Aiming (which you also cannot do while moving) is so incredibly slow that it forces you to rely on the game's lock-on targetting system.  Unfortunately, too many enemies (especially bosses) have moves that negate your lockon targetting making re-aquring them a painstaking effort.  In addition to general slow aiming, your upward/downward viewing angle maxes out at about 30 degrees above/below the horizon, so when enemies get above you, it's very difficult to deal with them (as many flying enemies or bosses will often do).  It makes the game challenging, but not in a fun way.  It's challenging kind of like running a 20 mile marathon after having someone break both your knees with a sledgehammer.

And then there's backtracking.  There is way way too much backtracking in this game.  It's one thing to spend an hour in a game exploring new environments without making progress, it's another thing to constantly be forced to backtrack an hour through previously explored territory to retrieve a single item, and then spend an hour getting back, only to get another item, and use it to backtrack an hour someplace else, etc.

Making the backtracking even worse is the frequent forced encounters where doors will lock preventing you from leaving and you have to fight a particular enemy (Dark Pirte Trooper) until you either kill it or it leaves.  Either method takes upwards of 5-6 minutes, because like many other annoying enemies in the game, it spends most of its time being completely invincible.

Metroid Prime 1 was a basically good game with some large flaws.  This game took it upon itself to be a copy of the first game, and increase the size of all those flaws without adding anything good.",2.0

"I expected much better. I am so disappointed in this mouse that I'm replacing it with a Logitech after only 6 months.

Software is buggy and annoying, not tied to Windows account login, but with an online account. Very annoying, especially considering one must rely on the software to switch between sensitivity. Terrible for a gamer.

The mouse lacks an onboard sensitivity switch, meaning you have to repurpose another button for this function, or leave the app to go to the aforementioned buggy software.

And, after only 6 months, the scroll wheel is not functioning properly, lacks any precision, and slips.

Lastly, the mouse has hiccups in it's movement, almost like an old mechanical mouse that had become dirty. The mouse is in perfect shape, mousepad is clean, yet is still sticks.

I'm moving up to a Logitech, a brand I've had great service from for many years. But given the apparently disposable nature of the Razer DeathAdder Chroma, you would be served just as well by one of the discount gaming mice that fail within the first year.",2.0
"I bought these USB adapters for the 360 in hopes that they would, well...maybe, just maybe, WORK! These work for the first few months, then just...stop working. They are obviously inferior quality, because on one of my controllers I have had for 5 YEARS the breakaway cable still works, while this one doesn't. I have tested this by observing that whenever I switch a USB adapter with this one, the controller mysteriously no longer works. Do not get this. I would recommend getting a new controller instead.

I am disappointed, because this is probably the only bad review I have written yet for an amazon product. Usually, they turn out fine, but not this one. Don't get it. Maybe, if you are lucky, it might work for a year, but then ka-boom.",2.0
"The game is a typical real time strategy/tactics. It combines elements from familiar Microprose games (e.g. Masters of Magic) with real time components. The major drawback of the game is that there's really not much to do - the game kind of plays itself. You only contribute by building buildings and telling them to produce units. The mechanism for controlling the units is kind of awkward, even if somewhat different than other games. You set a price on a territory to explore or a bad guy to kill and the units respond based on their character. There's no way to give specific commands to units. The game gets old really fast, the variations in strategy from one scenario to the next are negligible. It's interesting at first but gets boring very quickly. In addition the scenarios are kind of easy. I gave it up after the first two hours. I think you can find tons of better RT strategy games. I am a huge fan of the Microprose titles and this was a big time dissapointment.",2.0

"I really wanted to like this controller.  I bought two of them for a Raspberry Pi build and planned to use them wirelessly.  However, this was a bad idea.

I'll start off with what I like about the controller.  It feels really good in the hands.  Ergonomics are great, and for the most part the buttons all feel good as well.  The D-pad and analog sticks seem better than average.  The L2 and R2 triggers have a loose wobble to them when you're not pressing down on them, but this wasn't a big deal.  I like the backlighting when it works.  It's attractive and looks quality.  The only complaint I have is that the Turbo and Clear buttons are very easy to confuse with the Start and Select buttons when you're not looking; over time I got used to it however.

The real problems I had with these controllers happened when I tried to connect them.  I will warn you right now: these are not properly made to connect two USB dongles/controllers at once.  I couldn't get both to connect for the life of me, and the few times I did it was short lived.  Sometimes one would connect but press all the buttons twice, which I can only assume meant that it was connecting to both dongles simultaneously.  I tried putting the dongles in different ports, angling them away from each other, everything, to no avail.  Then, to top it all off, when even one of them was plugged in I would get terrible wifi transfer speeds  Next I tried to connect one via bluetooth to my Raspberry Pi.  I got it to pair, but it would only work in the shell menus and not in the controller configuration dialog.  Finally I decided to try one wired.  While it worked, the controller charges while tethered so the lights continually blink on and off until it's charged; I found this quite irritating.

To conclude, this controller has promise, but until the connection issues are resolved I can only recommend buying one at most.  Any more will give you headaches.",2.0
"Move over, ""Super Mario Sunshine."" There's a new king of mediocrity in the world of almost-always-amazing-but-occasionally-not Nintendo. Okay, so maybe mediocre is a little too harsh for the description of ""Super Mario Sunshine,"" but it's likely a tad generous for ""Metroid: Other M""--Nintendo and Team Ninja's ambitious joint project. In the months leading up to its release, fans were promised that this entry would be both ""the ultimate Metroid experience"" and that it would be a ""return to the series' roots."" Unfortunately for fans, neither promise was fulfilled, as I found out for myself two nights ago when I finished it. In this comprehensive review, I will try to cover all of the game's major aspects, both the good and the bad.

First, I'll go over the story, since Nintendo has made it evident that this is one of the most important parts of the game (don't worry, I'm not going to spoil any of the surprises). The game starts off with an amazing CGI cutscene, depicting the end of the climactic showdown between Samus Aran and Mother Brain at the end of the SNES classic, ""Super Metroid."" After Mother Brain's destruction, the game fast-forwards a little bit to Samus recovering from her battle and setting off once again to search for any, new bounties. Suddenly, she receives a distress beacon, which she immediately follows to a giant space station, called ""The Bottleship."" After landing, Samus meets up with her old squad, of which she was a part in her earlier, military days. The squad is led by her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich. Deciding to join forces, Samus assists the group in finding out what has happened on the station. That is when her adventure begins. Throughout the game, Samus continuously has flashbacks that are meant to flesh out her history for the gamer. These are done through the use of CGI cutscenes, like the one in the introduction. These cutscenese all look fantastic; it's obvious that Nintendo made this a priority in helping tell Samus' story. Nintendo has never been known for story-intensive games, which is why this change-up is a little bit refreshing. However, in every cutscene I saw, I never found myself actually liking Samus any more. Mostly, this is because she is depicted as a rebellious punk in her youth. Also, as each flashback unfolds, Samus gives the narration, which is overly melodramatic and only carries a tone of depression. Yes, as a kid, Samus was rebellious and bitter, and now, she just mopes around all the time, speaking poetically to everyone, who will listen to her. How is that likable? How is the player supposed to connect with such melancholy? It's as if her true mission is to make every gamer as depressed as she is.... I think we may be onto something here. Additionally, the present story aboard the Bottleship takes far too long to develop. It does start to pick up toward the end, but in all honesty, it's a bit silly. Although Nintendo went to great lengths to make story a much more important factor than in past games, this one mostly fails to have any resonation with the player.

Next, I will discuss graphics and sound. In all fairness, for a Wii game, ""Other M"" looks okay, but when you compare it to other first-party games on the console, it doesn't meet the bar (it's amazing what developers can do with the Wii's graphical power, when they actually try hard). Also, the character designs look atrocious. I understand that the team probably wanted a simpler look, since ""simplicity"" was the main theme Nintendo wanted to incorporate for this game, but why change the look of characters just for the sake of making changes? Regardless of the team's intentions, the characters and creatures look terrible, with absolutely no detail or life to them. Unlike the excellent Prime trilogy and Super Metroid, ""Other M"" has absolutely no memorable music or atmosphere. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Prime games, but it's very hard to accept downgrades of this number and magnitude. If you played the original Prime, you may remember what it was like exiting the claustrophobic, fiery Magmoor Caverns and stepping out into the wide-open, chilly Phendrana Drifts; there is no such moment or any of the Primes' other great moments in ""Other M"". Also, you will not find any of the near-perfect level and creature designs found in ""Super Metroid."" As for the voice-acting, Nintendo has not made many strides in catching up to the rest of the industry. I normally would not ridicule Nintendo for this, because they did try, but because they insisted on making this such a story-intensive game and because there is so much dialogue, I have to place it in the equation. In both the areas of graphics and sound, the Metroid series has taken a major step backwards.

Lastly, I will discuss the game play. For most Nintendo games, this section would take up the majority of a review, but in the case of ""Other M"", it gets an equal share. I won't say whether that was a slam or a compliment. After finishing the game, I still can't quite figure out who this game was meant for. On the one hand, it seems like Nintendo wanted a ""simple"" feel, forcing players to hold the Wii remote horizontally, without the use of the Nun chuck. On the other hand, the movement and combat that's required all feels more complicated and extremely awkward, especially at first, when the player is trying to adjust to the controls. If this was a true return-to-roots sidescroller, this control setup would work, but because players are often running through 3D environments, it becomes nearly unmanageable. The nun chuck attachment would have certainly remedied this offset. Regardless, combat can be real pain. Without a doubt, the most frustrating part of combat is firing missiles. In order to fire them, players are forced to turn the Wii remote and point it at the screen, switching the view to first-person. And because the Wii remote is the only controller allowed, the player cannot move while in this view. Also, the player cannot fire missiles at will. Instead, he or she has to hold the ""B"" button to lock onto a creature or destructible structure and then fire. Obviously, this can cause problems in intense firefights, in which missiles are required. You can literally lose one or two seconds in the process of switching to first person, actually locating the enemy, locking onto it, and firing the missile (or in some cases, charging up a shot to fire a super missile). Another complaint about the combat is auto-firing. Because of the strange 2D-meets-3D setup, players are forced to fire at enemies automatically, using the ""A"" button, without any precise aiming required. Yes, this is simple, but because enemies aren't always visible on the screen, auto-firing won't always detect them. Aside from combat, another sore spot for the game play is the process of regenerating health and missiles. In past Metroid games, players could destroy enemies, which would then drop items that Samus could use to recharge herself. In ""Other M"", however, enemies do not drop anything when they are destroyed. Instead, if the player wants to recharge Samus' missiles, he or she has to hold the Wii remote up and hold the ""A"" button. After between three and five seconds, Samus' missiles will be completely replenished. In the same manner, Samus can replenish her health, but there's a catch--in order to recharge Samus' health, the player has to come within an inch of dying (about 30 HP), and after three to five seconds of holding down the ""A"" button, Samus' health will only partially replenish itself. In the case of most battles, this becomes problematic, since most enemies aren't going to stand around to let the player replenish his or her health. It's obvious that the developers had the mindset that if the player's energy gets too low, then he or she deserves to die. However, you can replenish both Samus' health and missiles at navigation stations, which are also used to save your progress. Just hope that you can always make it to the next station before your health gets too low. Lastly, exploration has been largely scaled back. For some people, this may be more of a preference than a complaint, but because this is a Metroid title, I felt it was worth taking into account, especially since players were promised that this would retain all of Metroid's core elements. As for what does work, there are new moves made especially for this game: sense (a quick, evasive action), lethal strike, counter-attack, and overblast). All of these work well and become almost automatic for the player, thanks to Team Ninja's expertise with Ninja Gaiden's combat system.

""Metroid: Other M"" is an ambitious change to the familiar Metroid formula. It seems like there were opposing viewpoints for what should be done with the series, instead of a united, cohesive effort. ""Other M"" could have been an amazing game; I'm almost sure of it. I think that if Nintendo and Team Ninja were intent on working together on this project, they would have been better served choosing one control layout--either simple, 2D side-scrolling or full 3D exploration, with the nun chuck. Instead, what we have is a mish-mash of good and bad ideas, mixed with underdeveloped visual design and audio, and wrapped up in a mostly bland story. To me, it is shameful that Nintendo would allow this series to take such a fall, especially since the Nintendo development team behind this is the same team responsible for all of the early 2D Metroid classics, as well as Metroid Fusion for the Game Boy Advance. I sincerely hope that Nintendo learns from this mistake. If the company can retain its focus on solid game play and take gentle, productive steps on injecting more presentation value, I think it can keep its key franchises fresh, while making sure that gamers always see what makes each one so special.",2.0
"Originally I skipped over buying this game because I saw a bad video review for it on youtube and opted instead to buy Left 4 Dead GOTY (which I am SO happy for as it turned out to be one of my favorite games ever) but after buying Left 4 Dead 2 where they added too many changes to the game thus screwing up the brilliant simplicity of the original, I was talked into buying Dead Island. And the reason why I originally avoided buying it proved true. Not only is the game too slow-paced too often, but you are constantly repairing your weapons or else they break and you lose them for good. Yeah, I know, breaking weapons sounds more realistic, BUT 1. it takes away from the fun when you have to repair a baseball bat after only 9 or 10 zombie hits, and 2. why would i have to repair a crowbar or solid steel pipe or anything else that obviously can withstand a lot of real-world damage, and 3. why in the HELL do i have to repair a crowbar as often as i have to repair a wooden stick??? Yes, the durability of the weapons in this game is that screwed up.

The Hit Detection is horrible in this game (Zombies can magically hit you while having the same reach as you and yet you can't hit them unless you move closer), and the Aiming of the crosshairs in this game is spazmatic. Literally. You move the crosshairs to aim your next attack and it wobbles around the screen like someone having a seizure is controlling the analog stick.

What's REALLY stupid is that in this game you have to go around collecting money to not just buy things like weapons (which is a given) but you have to pay to repair and upgrade and modify your weapons. Sounds like something inconsequential to gripe about, right? Well you repair/upgrape/modify your weapons by collecting things around the island and then you find a workbench and your character chooses from the free things you have gathered and for some reason then have to pay to use them. Umm, if i collect a roll of duct tape and a knife and want to 'modify' my baseball bat at a workbench by taping the knife to the end of my bat, WHY do i have to PAY to tape that knife to my bat when I'M the one doing it and it's MY stuff that I collected??? It makes NO sense, but obviously then needed to institute some sort of system. It's just a crappy, unnecessary system.

The game looks good, but even the nice graphics cannot stop the boredom from creeping in. There's a LOT of walking (or driving, but i'll get to that in a minute) around, then you see a zombie or 2 and kill it, then a lot more walking around. Basically nearly EVERY mission is a ""Fetch"" quest where someone needs this item so you go from point A to point B, get the item, then return back to point A where you learn you need to get another item, so you then leave point A and go to point C, get the next item only to return to point A again where now at point D theres another item you need to fetch. Basically that's the missions of this game. And THAT would be fun IF there were a lot more roaming zombies and a lot better fighting/hit detection system in place.

Something i REALLY hate is because the weapon system is crap you find yourself using the melee attack button often, the only problem is there are only 2 preset controls and neither have the melee attack assigned to a more ""convenient"" button. One is the default with it assigned to the L Bumper, and the other changes it, but ALSO changes the controls into some weight ""analog"" fighting control scheme I've never seen in any game before that's just awkward and confusing.

And now the driving. yes, you can drive, and if you DO play this game remember to get the truck fixed ASAP as if you wait you will be doing a LOT of boring walking around. BUT driving is almost as annoying as walking because the viewpoint from inside the truck is so awkward you are constantly driving into things and getting stuck because it looks like you'll clear by it but you don't.

The island IS big, which is cool, and the zombies seem to randomly respawn so it's not like you clear an area and then its forever rid of zombies, BUT with the little amount of zombies sprinkled around the island AGAIN you will find yourself getting bored every few minutes before a short action burts, then back to the boring traveling again.

I LOVE Zombie games, and it's hard for me not to like Dead Island as i really tried, but there's just too much wrong with it -even with the free dlc the GOTY comes with- to recommend it for anything more than a weekend rental. TAKE MY ADVICE: if you're looking for a fun zombie game, BUY LEFT 4 DEAD GOTY. It's literally one of the best games I've ever played, one of the funnest, and it beats Dead Island HANDS DOWN in every category.

Also, this GOTY version has a new character and stuff but the game only comes with the original game booklet which doesn't say anything at all about him or his skills or specialties or anything. You'd think they'd at least update and put in a newer instruction booklet.

I give this game 2 stars. Fighting the zombies is just too annoying because of the shoddy hit detection and the annoying spazzy crosshairs, having to repair your weapons CONSTANTLY (at least until further in the game when you can PURCHASE upgrades) is just plain annoying, and there's just too much wandering around where nothing much of anything happens while you're on one of the too-many ""Go Fetch This-Or-That Item"" quests. Maybe I've given it an unfair lower rating because I can't help but compare it to Left 4 Dead, but that only confirms my advice to DEFINITELY buy LEFT 4 DEAD over this game any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.

And REMEMBER: I recommend the ORIGINAL Left 4 Dead Game of the Year edition, NOT Left 4 Dead 2. Although the second one is fun, the original is MUCH better. The second one added in a melee system so you can use bats and axes and whatnot (and funny enough their melee system is WORLDS BETTER than that of Dead Island, too) but they also added in a wider variety of special-type zombies, and the types they added are just annoying to the point that you wish they would have kept everything the same as the original but just made the second one a bunch of more levels.

Anyways, there you go and i hope this helps. Just don't blame me if you don't heed my advice =-)",2.0
"You want to play a Resident Evil game?  Too bad, this isn't one.  RE5 brings the sad addition of forced co-op play to this once great series, basically ruining the formula that worked for survival horror for so long.  RE5 is not horror, it's shooty-shoot stupidity while you have to drag your partner around for 20 hours.  Your partner never stops talking for the entire ridiculous story and she's best used as a pack-mule, shoving items in her pockets while hoping she shuts up.  The story really has little to do with RE canon - though Wesker shows up, so I guess that kinda counts - but, really this is a far cry from the glory days of RE2.  If you want a weak Gears of War wannabe, this may be the way to go - looking for horror?  Look elsewhere.",2.0
"The Good: Beautiful colors and graphics. Unique game that is fun to play for a while.

The Bad: EA put too much hype out there about it for way too long. They had everyone drooling over this games possibilities for YEARS. Talking like if gamers played this game every day, all day, it would take almost 80 years for them to explore all the games possible stars in the galaxy. And of course when the makers of Sims say something like that, it's very believable and appealing. But the game just didn't live up to the hype.
The main goals in this game are eating, growing and evolving. There's not much more to do then that, except picking fights and making friends.

That lesson was to outline a conpletely colored picture of the Chesire cat.

"I remember when Silent Hill 2 got an X-Box port as Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams and I'll tell you right now, I was undeniably happy about it . Not only did I lack a PS2 at the time, but I had played a copy of the PS2 original after playing the X-Box port of Silent Hill 2 and found that the X-Box port was aesthetically better than the original while the game on either system was and still is excellent.

Unfortunately, that was with Silent Hill 2, only. Silent Hill 4 does little to make itself stand out as an X-Box port and does very little to improve on its aesthetics, something that I feel it was in dire need of along with more competent writers to execute the story in something other than a dull, drab, boring, anti-climactic tone with most of the main characters, heroic or not, featuring the depth of a shoe string, boring, hackneyed atmospherics and shoddy game design choices.

The only difference between the PlayStation 2 and X-Box version is that the X-Box version forces you to save games on the X-Box Hard Disk; you can't save copies of Silent Hill 4 on the portable Memory Units and you can't copy ANY of the saves you make. Yeah, not only does the game try to bore you to death with its apathy and lack of immersion, but it also keeps you from storing save games on something other than the console's hard drive. I guess the only plus side is that the save game image on the X-Box has The Eye of Watchfulness rather than one of the Toadstool monsters writhing around in front of a bright pink background.

That's the only change. It's graphically the same, the minimalist real-time menu system works the same, the sounds are all laughable and pathetic, there's no other character you can play as (something I would've payed good money to do just to spend fifteen minutes playing as someone other than a living piece of drywall in a nappy wig and blue jeans), no different lighting effects. Just a save-game nit-pick.

You're still playing the same boring game trying to pass as horrific when you have to deal with idiotic invincible enemies such as ghosts, Ringu rip-offs, rolling wheelchairs and a gun totting hippy in a trench coat trying to come off as a serial killer. You're still cycling through five different drab, well lit levels that takes the effects of 'subtle atmospherics' and drives them so hard and heavy into the game it's difficult to say your even having fun much less getting terrified, you're still playing as some mutt-faced, emotionless drone who wiggles his butt every time he arms himself and strafes around an enemy letting him mumble ineffective and awkward dialogue and grope any and all blood encrusted women he stumbles across who just so happen to be more underdressed and sexy than the average stripper, you still only get a pocketful of firearms that do little to keep the enemies down, you're still reading memos written by idiots who forsake continuity and factual errors for the sake of sounding scary in that cheesy, JC haunted house kind of way, you're still thumbing your way through a game that hardly even tries to be dramatic or immersive until the last three minutes before the final boss fight and you've still got endings and replay value about as pointless as a pair of scissors without a screw.

The game is still terrible in its own broken right. If anything, I can recommend you get the X-Box version of this game for two reasons:

A) because you don't own a PlayStation 2

and

B) Because a cheap game deserves a cheap price.",2.0

The jokes are for 14 year olds,the game itself is very short and the whole thing feels very cheaply made. The only reason i gave this game 2 stars is because it has multiplayer,thats it,and even that gets old quickly. The game is about a man that works at a video game company and has to simply get through the week doing little chores like getting his paycheck and going to the store to get milk for his lady. These little things turn out to make the week a living hell as danger pops up at every turn...even at church.

"Throughout my childhood, Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town was a big part of my life. I still give it repeated plays and treasure the memories I had exploring the game. It will always be one of my favorite video games and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

But this game is NOT in the closest to earning that same praise from me. I learned about Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life from a younger friend. When I saw it being played at her house, the graphics looked so beautiful and it seemed like something to be enjoyed. Wow, looks can be deceiving. First of all, I want to praise this game for the beautiful graphics and design. It also brings in a lot of unique ideas such a different kinds of cows and ducks and being able to grow trees. I really liked how you interact more with your family and raise your son. Now, the negatives. The farm chores are incredibly boring and watering plants feels impossible. I prefer the class farming feel of the previous games. Days and months drag on and on. Maybe this is just me but I prefer a more high speed feel. It is more fun to just accomplish one big thing a day! The festivals are completely boring and all of the characters, besides the three main girls you can date, are dull and one dimensional.

NOTHING ever changes or happens in this game besides for your son. The town stays boring, the days stay boring, the farms stay boring, it is just an all around boring experience.

I feel like this game had some potential and good ideas but with such a terrible farming system and town, it just is not worth playing. You are much better off purchasing Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town or Harvest Moon 64.",2.0
"Think back the fall of 1999 when ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released.  The elitist movie critics were in a full-fledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since ""Citizen Kane"".  Back in 1999 so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed.  Then a funny thing happened: time passed.  Like the rest of the superficial Hollywood crowd, the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie.  Now it's hard to find anyone who's filling to admit they liked the ""Blair Witch Project"".  Why do I mention that?  Because the story's nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of Nintendo's ""Wind Waker"" game.

Since ""Wind Waker"" is a Zelda game, and since the Zelda franchise is amazing, the ""Wind Waker"" must be amazing too, right?  Right? Unfortunately, no, but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered ""yes"" to that question.  They went into a full-fledged campaign to convince themselves, and the public, that this game deserved a pedestal next to ""Link to the Past"" and ""Ocarina of Time"".  Only now, years after its release, do I hear consistent complaints about the game.  Below is a list of problems with the game:

1) The sailing aspect of the game takes up at least 50% of the adventure and it is extremely tedious.  Nintendo didn't even attempt to streamline this process.  You can literally set your direction, put the controller on the floor, and sit back and watch the minutes pass as Link sails along to your destination.  In order to further extend the playtime of sailing, the user is forced to embark on numerous mini-quests where many must be performed numerous times through the game.  The most annoying are the ""fetch quests"" where you dredge the ocean floor for items.  *Yawn* Are we having fun yet?

2) The game consists of only a few dungeons, and some of them are extremely easy.  Important aspects of the game were replaced with time-consuming fetch quests from the ship.

3) The game has an unexploited storyline.  I can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big, but completely fizzle out.  (Between this and the lack of dungeons, I am convinced this game was rushed to market)

4) I might as well say it: the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overall-quality of the game.  The Link model is the worst: a massive head, massive eyes, and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair.  At least you spend most of your time staring at the back of Link's head.

5) Before release we were told that the NPC (non playable characters) were going to be far more advanced than others we've seen in the past.  I have no idea where Nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in OoT and just about every video game I've played.  They certainly aren't as interesting as those from Majora's Mask.

6) And I've just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu.  Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.

7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.

"This game has it's ups and downs. The plot in this game is fairly original. It takes bits from different stories, and it becomes something new. And, I love the comedy in this game. For example, there is a rivalry between two of the characters for control of Ari, which is amusing. There is also flirting, which you take part in if you choose. And some of the characters are fairly interesting. But, the dungeons are terrible. They're repetitive, you just beat urns and things a lot of the time to move on. Plus, you're under attack constantly outside of cities. And since the combat is boring, it's an excruciating experience overall. But the cut scenes are fun and you get to choose what to say many times throughout the game. I think the plot being revealed is worth the torture the rest of the time. You should probably rent Okage and check it out before buying it.",2.0
"Of my collection of Game Cube games, this is DEFINETLY not my favorite.  The adventures are not fun, as the action and the combat is stale and awkward.  The attacks are not coordinated and the enemies are plain.  The graphics are ordinary, certaintly not anything special.  The multi-player absoulety stinks.  With four seperate screens it is absoulely confusing and the four-fold screens are so small, little can be seen.  A much better action game would be Super Smash Melee.",2.0

"What could have been an amazing game now just appears to be a filler while they perfect Guitar Hero III.
Despite the poor play list (check it out, even hard core 80's fans don't even recognize half the songs), this game could have been worth the money if it would have had the content of other guitar hero games, but it didn't.  It only had a portion of the characters from Guitar Hero II, no unlockable songs, and only one unlockable character.  The lack of unlockable songs is a huge dissappointment, as it leaves you paying the same price of Guitar Hero II (game only) but only having half the content.  Also, with only one character to unlock and no songs, there is no motivation to strive to get the five stars on every song.",2.0
I am indifferent about this product. As much as I like all the other Lego games I think this is just too much and not really thought through. Its very similar to Disney Infinity but has flaws. With Disney infinity you set the characters onto the console and leave it alone and play. With dimensions we have to run from our seats to constantly change characters and their position on the platform. Its completely uncomfortable. I like to sit and play my games and concentrate not run from my seat every 10 minutes and change the position to where my character should go. This is the most annoying part of the game. Lots of great characters to choose from but also lots of times running to set them on the console. Wish it was more like Disney Infinity,2.0
"The Original Halo was a ground-breaking title. The expectation for HALO2 was so great that Microsoft decided to greedily milk its own users...
PC users have been waiting for HALO2 to be released for Windows for over 3 years. Now is too little, too late. Not to mention the shameless WinVISTA promotion.

All these years Microsoft was dragging its feet. Why? The release of (compatibility-hell) WinVISTA was coming - and HALO2 was planed to boost sales. Then WinVISTA got repeatedly delayed - and so was Halo 2.
RESULT: In 2004 the graphics were cutting edge, in 2007 they are just presentable. Even though the game requires an above average (and quite expensive) Hardware configuration, it actually looks worse than UNREAL TOURNAMENT 2004.

QUESTION: why is HALO2 only compatible with WinVISTA since it does NOT take advantage of DirectX10?
ANSWERS : (1) let's help sell those WinVISTA finally!; (2) there are hardly any affordable DirectX10-compatible video-cards available; (3) let's charge the users for playing OnLine with WindowsLIVE!!

The gameplay and overall presentation is not that different from the original Halo. Sure, surfaces got better textured, shiny reflections got added and now (limiting and clumsy) dual-yield is available - but do these actually make a difference to a real gamer?

It is truly a shame that PC users get exploited in such shameless way. After all, HALO3 is getting released for X-BOX.

By now most of the glitches have been fixed in the story mode or at least I didn't experience any of them.

"Being primarily a campaign player, I had a great time with BF2 and BF3. Unfortunately, BF4 did not meet my expectations at all on this front. Missions are disjointed and feel 'deja vu' from many other shooters out there. There are many bugs and miscellaneous problems that, on their own, are not a huge deal, but together as a whole, significantly reduced my level of enjoyment for this game. A few examples are...
- Invisible shield in front of enemies and prevent you from making contact with your shots.
- Enemy tanks that spawn out of thin air once you cross a certain part of the map.
- Poor texture overall.
- Ability for enemies to hit you even when I am behind cover.
- Poor selection of weaponry; cannot access sniper rifle after 50% through the campaign?!
- Poor autosave/checkpoint location, forcing you to replay large sections of the mission. Extremely frustrating!!!

I understand campaign is not a focus for BF4 series but if since the developer decided to create it, they should have put more thought into it. Or else just make it a multiplayer only game such as MAG. If you are looking for solid multiplayer, BF4 is still a good choice, just don't buy this for the campaign alone.",2.0

"Everyone knew about this game and millions bought it day one. We were wildly misled on what the gameplay was actually going to be like. The game was extremely hyped setting people up for disappointment because this wasn't the game that was advertised nor what the gamers actually wanted. So we all bought the game and found out very quickly what a repetitive experience this was going to be. And there's simply no excuse to do the same thing over and over again. They even try to switch it up very slightly. Remember that mission where you wield a sword? It wasn't very well done but at least it was something different in the actual gameplay. Shooting things is great but there needs to be more mission variation or its literally just the same thing with different enemies or backgrounds.

They held off on content for us to pay for later. They gave us a game with surprisely small amounts of content for a $65 purchase. This whole trend of day one DLC and cutting out content for later is a disgrace to gaming and is a shady business practice.

 While the production, shooting mechanics, and music are all certainly excellent, it can't hide the fact that the game essentially has no story or important interaction with it's world. I have no attachment to my character, why should I care about altering his powers and getting cooler gear? The pvp is decent even if it's a little empty and unbalanced. Only reason to play is with friends.",2.0
"Ive been playing AC2 for about a week now and Im not very impressed by it yet. I read reviews before I bought it about how it was a major improvment over the first one but I just don't see it. You complete missions similar to the first one. Parts of the game are very slow paced such as having to follow someone to a destination,I carried a crate or box or something of that nature to a destination and put it down on the ground,where is the challenge in that. I will continue to play it and try to get into it and get used to the controls. I still have trouble when climbing a building,I try to jump up but for some reason I jump back and fall and die. Maybe I just haven't played enough of it yet.

Update 10/8/11:I have just completed the game and it was better than I first thought and it was better than the first one as well,but still not quite what I expected. Fighting and defeating major enemies is very easy,while solving puzzles and riddles is quite difficult at times. I like that I could swim this time instead of drowning and getting desynchronized as in the first one. I was able to get used to the controls and learned to jump up onto buildings and ledges. The ending to the game was better than the first but still a little difficult to understand. Overall I give this game 3 out of 5 stars. If your looking for a good action game I don't think this is for you,but if you like finding hidden objects and solving puzzles and riddles this is a great game to play.",2.0

"What starts off as a fun, amusing game eventually turns into a typical checkpoint type save disaster. As opposed to using creativity to add challenge to the game, the designers decided to use repetition instead. Although it is not true checkpoints as such, but rather you simply cannot save a mission until you complete multiple objectives. At first this is not a problem, but towards the middle of the game you suddenly find yourself trying to do the same thing over and over again. Perhaps if you have the memory of a three year old , you may find this to be exciting and fun. However, if you have anything more upstairs, you will quicky tire of this waste of your time. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't such a large amount of time that you are sometimes set back. You may finally complete two objectives and be working on your third when you get killed and have to start over from the very beginning. This is not creative. This is not challenging. This is simply repetition. It's a shame too, because this game could have been a lot of fun.",2.0
"From the blurb on the game case, you might get the impression that there's more to this game than there is. It's a match-3 game. That's it, nothing more. It is rated E for everyone, but is probably best suited for kids 8 and younger. There's just not much to it.

The ""adventure"" consists of the game's characters telling you a bit about the area you are in.

There are 5 zones. Each has 6 levels. Each level is one 7x7 tile match-3 game board. So 30 match-3 game boards in the game. No variation in size or shape of the board. Depending on the score earned on each level, you'll be rewarded with 1-3 green gems. Earning gems leads to the unlockables: still images/concept art from the movie. You also earn gold as you complete levels, and you get to keep any gold earned even if you don't successfully complete the goal of the level. You can then visit the in-game shop and buy power-ups (extra time, extra moves, shuffle, etc) to help you complete the levels.

The manual says there are 4 game modes: time limit, moves limit, item collection (clear certain special items from the board) and item sink (drop certain items to the bottom and off the board). These modes are intrinsic to the 30 game boards, though. Some of the boards have a time limit for completion, for example. Some have a # of moves limit. You can't choose to play the game in 1 mode or another. That option would have certainly added to replayability. As it is, the game took around 4 hours to complete, and doesn't really inspire a desire to revisit it.

A kid-friendly match-3 game for fans of the movie. For anyone else, I'd have to say, ""Move along, folks. Nothing to see here.""",2.0
"I'm actually playing through this series backwards. I bought the 3rd game despite it getting critically panned and I liked it, so I figured I'd give the second game a try too. Unfortunately, this game deserves its horrible reviews.

The thing that seperates this game from the third (and probably the first) is the platforming elements. Like a 3rd-person action game you'll be forced to hop across platforms, activate switches by jumping on them, etc. This part of the game fails miserably. Jumping is a stiff and painful affair, and you'll fall to your death several times in some of the levels. Making matters worse is that once you lose all your life, it's back to the beginning. No mid-level saves here to make things easier. Removing these platforming elements could have made the game a lot more enjoyable.

Really, Konami forgot they were making a brawler here. Horrible jumping sections aside, the levels aren't that populated with bad guys and the attack combos aren't satisfying. The old arcade game (which can be unlocked on this disc) was called a button-masher for a reason. It threw so many enemies at you that you were busy mashing buttons to stay alive. What TMNT 2 ends up being is neither a good adventure game nor a good brawler game. And in the oddest trick of all, it asks all players to share a life bar. I guess this was to encourage cooperation to protect less experienced players, but what it really does is put the burden on that player to not screw things up for everyone.

It's unfortunate the gameplay stinks, because the production values are decent. I like the cel-shaded look, they got the cartoon voice actors to reprise their roles, and use a lot of clips from the series. There's even some ""new"" animation in here, but its off-model and stiffer than a bad anime program. Whatever. And again, the inclusion of the classic arcade game is a huge bonus.

I really can't recommend TMNT 2, except it might be worth it if you unlock the arcade game, which is buried reasonably far in the main levels. Unless you collect all things Turtles, skip this one and grab the third one, which is a real button-masher and not this sorry excuse for fun.",2.0

"Although fun at first, unfortunately SW: Force Unleashed just doesn't ever get far enough off the ground to be anything memorable. I'm in the unusual position of having played this game right after finishing up Ninja Gaiden II. I'm afraid that may have made the problems with this game shine even more for me. First off is the combat. It's not bad but it's not great either. Everything felt bogged down and slow. Many things I would make my character do felt delayed. For action games like this you need complete control and I never felt like I had it in this game. The camera was also really bad. I could deal if there were an easier way of positioning it but when you move the camera yourself with the thumb stick it moves really slow (like the rest of the combat). There's a way to snap the camera to the player's back instantly which is great except that you have to click the left thumb stick to do it. Too often I'm running around and if I click the thumb stick the camera snaps to my back and immediately moves the direction I'm running so it's still not centered on my back. I found it better to start throwing force pushes and lightning in the opposite direction I couldn't see and hope I'd get lucky before trying to move the camera. The lock-on feature sucks but that's okay with me because if developers make these games right you won't need one anyway. The engine also seemed glitchy. There were plenty of times where I'd hang in the air. Sometimes the frame rate would drop and things would get choppy (although that didn't happen that much). Also, I know it's a Star Wars game and you don't want blood but give me something that helps me realize when I'm hitting something. Especially the bigger enemies. Give me some particle effects or SOMETHING. Half the time it doesn't look like you're hitting anything at all in this game. It's also difficult to distinguish when something is hitting you as well. There were plenty of times where I felt I was doing good and all of the sudden I died. Only then do I realize ""Wow I was getting hit by something the whole time"". This is offset by the feature of getting health back for every kill which is a must have for this game. You wouldn't need that feature if the combat elements were polished enough that a player could keep from getting hit provided he was skillful enough. Screw it, I'm just gonna post the pros and cons. If you are a big fan of Star Wars, I'd add one more star to my rating and that's probably the extent you'll enjoy this game.

Pros:
Force Powers are fun to play with
Story is a decent tie in to the movies

Cons:
Combat is slow and repetitive
Controls are iffy and slow to respond
Game is short with little reason to play again",2.0
"The two starts are not for hating TITANFALL but for what was in the case , was wondering why are there 3 disc ? I put Disc 1 in and what came up was Battlefield 1942 Game , I follow the instructions thru and there was no TITANFALL game , I then put in Disc 2  and message came up at bottom on  my windows 7 ..saying there is no dvd or video . To me having the case with TITANFALL on cover and in the back with information about TITANFAN Game , to me is misleading . And there was no information saying anything about Battlefield 1942 game . I will admit that doing games on windows 7 is new to me , even know I've have this computer for 4 years now . I have try USB Controllers on my Windows 7 , but never figure out how to make them work , so then I gave up on trying to make USB Controller work . Up till now a week or two weeks ago I brought out my USB Controllers and try it again, don't know what I did to make both Controllers light up (Two different Controllers) and have played 3 games so far .

"Unreal the fast pased FPS is the king off all frag filled game.  In their third outing, Epic has thrown in everything and the kitchen sink.

"i admit it.. i believed the hype.  i was pretty sure gears of war would be a fun game.  i stand corrected.  first of all, i'll start with the controls.  i could argue a FPS is only as good as its controls.  and if that's the case, gears of war is bad.  precision in the controls is very lacking.  whether that's the xbox controller's fault or the game's fault, i don't know, but it's not good.  i can easily name three ps2 FPS's that have much better shooting controls - timesplitters: future perfect, urban riot response and resident evil 4.

graphics - nothing but hype.  sure, duh, the graphics are going to look better than an original xbox or a ps2.  does that mean they're mindblowing, artistic, or better than typical modern PC games like, say, call of duty 2 or far cry?  HELL TO THE NO.  for one thing, the color is.. well, THERE IS NO COLOR.  just look at the screenshots!  they might as well have just painted the whole game gray.  it looks terrible.  if that's good graphics, i'll pass on good graphics, thank you very much.  dead rising has better graphics, but it's not getting hyped for it.

gameplay - not good... not good.  the cover idea is just a cheap silly gimmick, a selling point.  i've been using cover, flanking, popouts, proning, sprinting etc. for years with the call of duty series.  i'm not impressed at all.  weapons?  nothing special.  painkiller for PC has tons of more fun and innovative weapons.

story?  well, i wasn't expecting an RPG or anything, but this feels like starting to watch a movie in the middle of it.  story isn't terribly important in a FPS, but it wouldn't hurt to make the player care about the characters or their mission.

i would take so many FPS's over gears of war.  i don't care how many people say it's great or how many great reviews it gets.  hype hype hype.  i would say ""graphics don't make a great game,"" but considering the graphics aren't that great, i'll just say ""hype doesn't make a great game.""",2.0

"First, as of right now this game randomly crashes. A lot. I know this will be fixed in an update, but it has crashed on me so many times that I stopped playing it and will not go back until it is fixed. At least 30 percent of my warps ended in the game crashing, and it has crashed at random other times as well. It also completely froze on me once. The same happened to my fianc&eacute;. It seems the farther you are in the game, the more often it crashes.

I was anticipating this game since it was first shown at E3 over two years ago, though I kept my expectations low because, while I like the idea, I was afraid it would get boring after a month or so. After about five hours I started to get bored, but I have since discovered the level of boredom really depends on the randomly generated planets. The planets I visited within the first several hours of play were all very similar: rocky, dead, or toxic.  That really hinders exploration, or rather the interest in exploration, although one of the planets was pretty much impossible to explore due to extreme heat storms every minute or so.

The problem with the game is it's not entirely about exploration and not entirely survival. The two just don't mix very well together and create a tedious game where you can't focus on exploring because you keep needing resources. Up until I finally discovered a planet full of life (my 14th planet: the first one that actually had grass!), I was quickly losing interest in the game.  Before that, I had only visited places that looked like they were either desert or a nuclear wasteland full of mutant creatures. I have seen some interesting animals, and you can interact a little with a few creatures, but it is very limited and, so far at least, the only benefits are getting to see them up close for a very brief amount of time and the animal discovering a random resource for you.

The colors in the game are a bit much though.  The color contrasts and flashing lights started to hurt my eyes after maybe an hour, and I've never had that problem with any video game. I was doing a pulse jump and had to look away from the screen because of the flashes between red and blue, and then again when it was red and green. The color contrast is just too much, and I would prefer to not need to adjust my TV every time I play this game.  I turned the brightness in the game settings way down, and that seems to have mostly fixed my problem.  It would help if they had an option in the game to turn down the saturation or something.  I love colors, but it's just a bit too much when all of them are flashing at you all at once.

The game is still new and (hopefully) there are aspects of it that haven't been discovered yet. If not, then I see it fading fast as it can become boring quickly, depending on the planets you find.  I will say that there is way too much focus on inventory management: you need items to craft improvements, yet there is very limited space for the items you need.  I've found several upgrades that add an extra space to my suit, but it still isn't enough, making inventory management an annoying process. You can buy a bigger ship...if you have a lot of credits to spend.

Combat is extremely lacking as well.  In space, once your shields are down, you need to quickly go into your inventory and recharge them.  Granted, it isn't meant to be Rogue Squadron, but fighting in space...well, it basically just sucks.  Combat on the ground isn't as bad, though, having played many shooters, I am still adjusting to the fact that the gun doesn't reload on its own once empty.  Hopefully that will be changed in a patch, though I have my doubts.  The controls are bit weird too, especially the menu interface which moves and requires you to hold the button rather than just press it.  Also, as far as I can tell, there is no way to tell what you are directly above, making landing on landing pads an estimation or guessing game.  And although they said it was not a multiplayer game from the beginning and we all knew that (or at least those of us who paid attention), it would have added more to the game if you could someday meet up with a friend and explore a planet together.

I don't think the game is really worth the high price as it just seems to be lacking, but it has some good aspects.  Yes, the game may have been a little over-hyped...we all know that.  It's still a good game.  I just hope there is more to it and that some of the minor annoyances are changed in an update.

Once the crashing problem is fixed, I will rate it at 3 or 4 stars. Until then, it's not worth it.",2.0

"Well, before i wrote this review, i looked at about 30 others, because i wanted to see what they had to say. I am going to repeat a lot of things, but i think most people missed some things that were critical. First off, the lack of superstars, and extra superstars. I want to let you all know about my opinon on each superstar. Eddie, it was a terrible loss, and i wish everyone in the wwe and his family the best. One thing I had a problem with S Vs. Raw 2006 is Eddies entrance, Remember when he told Batista that he had changed and they came out to face MNM and he had his old music? Well you cannot change his music and and enterance to make him the loveble Eddie that we all remember. Many superstars left out like Lashely, Finlay, Gunner Scott, MNM(they even show MNM on the Smackdown Theme Movie!!!) Simon Dean, and others. On Raw, Divas such as Maria, the Cuttest Diva of them all. Mickie James(Phsyco) Spirt Squad, andothers. Also Lita doesnt Come Out with Edge. Many other things wrong with this game. The Biggest Problem I had with Smackdown Vs. Raw 06 is that when you are in a match the Ref gets in the way all the time, so when you are hitting your opponent, the ref will stand there and if you hit him on accident he will DQ you... Cost me a title too many times. It also gets kind of annoying when you play Batista on the Smackdown ring and Micheal Cole and Tazz will argue about Batista Not being on Smackdown!!!! HELLO!!!! HE IS!!!!! The legends are kinda cool, but i wish they had more. I noticed alot of people wanted Lesner as a legend, and I agree!!! Next to Batista, Rey, Eddie, he was my favorite superstar, and i guess i will have to go and buy HCTP again to use him and F-5 my opponents. I heard that they are doing Smackdown Vs. Raw 2007, and i would love to see D-X on there. Also the season was way to short and they only had one storyboard for each show. On raw you fight Edge and Christian for the Tag Team Titles, and If you win, They take the titles away from you because You were not the orignal title holder, Regal was. And on SD you face off against some legends, that is real fun!!!(sarcastic. The last thing is the Manager modes, what a joke!! they should have made it to where it was like a storyboard, where if you where Teddy Long, you could interupt to for example Rey and JBL, and tell JBL that he has a handicapped match aagainst Big Show and Kane or someting.

"As a horror fan, gaming fan, and forensic freak, I was waiting with baited breath for this to come out.  The graphics are something to behold - unbelievable environments and character movement.  However, I just cannot get into this game because of the ridiculously laughable plot.  In the first mission you are just walking around, and creatures made out of tar start skulking around and attacking you.  At this point I have no concept of why I am being attacked by tar-monsters (according to the box this is a story about catching a serial killer).  Subsequently, you are attacked by posessed baby dolls, freaks in chain-mail, a wild, posessed grizzly bear (who somehow knows exactly where you are at any time inside a building complex), and the ""alcohol monster"" which is YOU with some mummy-face.  Now I am fighting a ""mad magic-man"", who I have to kill with bottles of booze.  Are you kidding me?  This plot is pathetic!  What a waste!

I never really liked Sega CD because it was more like an HD upgrade to the original Genesis versions. The Terminator is no exception. While the game has movie sequences (which have disgustingly horrific quality), and sharper graphics and sound it doesn't make the game any more special.

The game is just like any other side scrolling 2D action game but with a movie license. Don't get me wrong this game does a good job at that but we've seen it all before.

I played it for a couple of hours and worked through the mini-games but found myself getting bored.  I could DEFINITELY see how this would be a good party game or an ice breaker.  I decided to resell my copy and buy something else like Elebits (which I really enjoy).

I cannot pinpoint what bugged me most about this game except that I think I was expecting a lot more.  No love lost, I know that a lot of people really enjoy this game.  I personally am having much more fun with Sports, Elebits, and the Trauma game.",2.0

"First of all, this game was not from Jonathan Boakes, although it is in the style of Dark Fall and he does provide voice talent.  Nucleosys is an Argentinean studio, and this is the first adventure game from Argentina.

On the plus side, the graphics were exquisite, the house layout was easy to navigate, and there is an interesting (albeit underdeveloped) option to turn on hints.

Overall, it's clear that Nucleosys has the potential to do some really great adventure games.  This isn't one of them, though. There were enough bright spots of cleverness to give me hope for the next Nucleosys game, but many of the puzzles were incredibly non-intuitive.  If you can finish this game without resorting to walkthroughs, then I congratulate you.

Also, the story was weak.  The only goal of the first part of the game was trying--ultimately unsuccessfully, mind you--to turn on the electricity. None of it was scary, and some of the plot twists were tired (please, can we not have any more exotic african curses?)

I can never find enough games like Dark Fall and Syberia, so I recommend Scratches as adequate entertainment until the next really good one comes out.  Maybe it'll come from Nucleosys...?",2.0

"Wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting the typical Final Fantasy, epic storyline, chocobos, and parties. But, you play one character, Vincent, its storyline is okay so far, I think its more full of drama than it needs to be (and comes on early in the game, not later on when the plot thickens...), and Vincent's personality is rather... strange, I want to say stereotypical. Worst of all, its a shooter. They annoy me. It helps having an auto-lock-on/target feature at the beginning of the game, you can later switch it out if you want to. And if you die, you have to do the WHOLE level ALL over again, I think that is the biggest disappointment and frustrating aspect of the game, especially since I sometimes forget to watch my health because I'm so absorbed into trying to figure out where my targets are. There are no chocobos, cactuars, or moogles (so far in the game). There are still other creatures, but I love the old ones. The environment is all modern/futuristic cityscape, I have yet to see nature. The game is too annoying for me to continue it.

And to add insult to injury you can unlock more Zombies maps, but only if you fork over another 50 dollars in classic Activision fashion.

"I bought this game a few weeks ago to run on my new PC.  The PC is pretty sick - 4GB of RAM, dual processors, 256MB of memory on the *embedded* video card.  Checked the requirements for this game and confirmed that I met (or exceeded) them.  Installed the game, allowed the game to automatically set the graphics options, and tried to play it.  I got SINGLE DIGIT FPS.  Did some reading online (around 2 - 3 hours) and tried some troubleshooting.  Ultimately, I had to change my processor affinity so that the game only runs on one, and crank ALL graphics settings down to minimum.  The game still crawls at around 12 - 13 FPS.

  It is absurd.  All of my drivers are up to date and I have no problems running any other software.  This game came out several years ago.  The fact is that it is a complete system hog.  There is absolutely no reason I should be having so many problems running it.

  I finally decided to buy a new video card, so I dropped around $[...] on a new card.  Obviously not the most crazy card out there but it was a significant improvement over the one I had.  Installed it, updated drivers, launched NWN2, and the power consumption from the card forced a reboot of my PC.  I bought a beefier power supply and installed it.  Now the game runs passably well.  I still can't crank up all the eye candy.  So the final bill was $[...] for the new game, $[...] for a new card, $[...] for the power supply, and $[...] for a DVI cable.  What a bargain!  $[...] for a game that came out 3 years ago.

  Now I remember why I swore off PC gaming and bought a 360.",2.0

First of all - it took FOREVER to get to me.  I want to say about 2 weeks or more.

"I'm pretty darn depressed about this Nvidia Shield 16GB (Android TV).  Upon it's release a week or so ago, I drooled over the hardware specs and jumped up and down about the possibility of replacing my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roku-3-Streaming-Media-Player-2014-model/dp/B00BGGDVOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roku 3 Streaming Media Player (2014 model)</a>&nbsp;and Xbox 360.  Plus, the ability to cast and mirror from my Nexus 5 phone and link to the stuff in my Google account was just gravy.  Alas, it was not to be.  I'm assuming the problem is that I jumped on this too early.  NVIDIA is still trying to work out the bugs, kinks, and lacks.  So, here's a list of my current issues with it:

- No Amazon Apps:  That's right.  As of this writing, there are no Amazon apps officially available for this.  Yes.  You can sideload a few of them.  But, they either just don't work, or work miserably (lack of controller support).  This is an absolute killer for me.  My primary reason for buying this Shield was to replace my Roku 3.  Yes.  I can use the Google Play Movies & TV app to watch the few movies I've bought through the Google Play Store.  But, the vast majority of my media is right here on Amazon.  Without an Amazon Instant Video app (and it can't even be sideloaded), the Shield has lost most of it glamour.

- USB Keyboards and Mice Don't Work:  There's a thread on this over in the NVIDIA Shield forums.  I don't know if the Shield has a problem with ALL USB keyboards and mice.  But, my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Mk560-Wireless-Wave-Combo-Plus-K351-Keyboard-M705-Wireless-Mouse/dp/B006HIFZMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Mk560 Wireless Wave Combo Plus: K351 Keyboard & M705 Wireless Mouse</a>&nbsp;is one of the ones that just doesn't work.  The connection to the devices seems to drop whenever they're idle for about two seconds.  So, typing and pointing with these is just impossible.  Without a keyboard and mouse, you're stuck with using the controller for text/pointing input.  And that's a pain.

- No Multiple Users:  The Shield just doesn't support multiple users.  If a second person wants to sign in to the device for a personalized experience, he's SOL.  Yes, a second person can sign in.  But, to do that, the previous person must be logged out.  And, not JUST logged out.  Their account must be REMOVED.  That means that when they want to sign back in, they can't just choose a remembered account.  They have to laboriously go through the whole log in procedure again.  And, they have to use the controller for text input because, as noted above, the keyboard and mouse don't work.  Plus, the Settings/Apps/Recommendations/NVIDIA Gaming ID all stay the same across the accounts.  The only thing that logging in seems to do is specify the Google account to use to buy things.

- External Storage Isn't All That Useful:  Unless a game has been written to support external offload, you won't be able to move your games to an external device you've added for storage (USB connected drive or Micro SD card).  Yes, you can store data files, music, and photos on an external drive.  But, games are going to take up a lot of space.  As such, the 16GB version I bought isn't all that useful.  I read one review where the reviewers downloaded four games and filled up their storage.  Theoretically, that should change with Android M.  But, right now, if you're a gamer, it's not a good situation.

- I'm Just Old:  This relates to that 10 foot, living room, controller-based interface.  It just makes my brain itch.  The interface design standards seem to be such that nothing tells anyone anything.  In general, if you've got a row of icons sitting on the screen, making them active and waiting doesn't get you any information.  I can't tell you how many times I've looked at those icons throughout the games and system and wondered what in the heck they do.  If I select it (using the never explained buttons on the controller), will it erase the game, format the drive, blow up the television, crash the car, and level the house?  Or, will it mark something as a favorite?  I don't know.  I'm of an age where I wonder about older people who can't understand that they can just click on the Start Button to do something.  Now, I've realized that my son is of an age where he's got to wonder about me when I can't understand what the buttons and icons on these controller-based interfaces do.  It's sad.

Anyway, I'm a bit upset with this NVIDIA Shield.  With it's tremendous hardware specs, it promised so much.  But, it just hasn't delivered yet.  So, I'm sorry to say that I'm rating it at a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5.  I'll see if Amazon will let me return it.  Maybe I'll end up selling it.",2.0
"As anyone reading this review is doubtless aware, this game is based on the third installment in the Harry Potter movie franchise, which is in turn based off the third book in the Harry Potter series.  This one concerns the third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley as they attend class, learn new spells, fight various enemies, and - by the way - deal with the fact that the notorious wizard criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison with the intent to murder young Mr. Potter, and he is being pursued by Dementors, which are Ringwraith-like creatures that act as prison guards and they are intent on recapturing Sirius Black, and woe to anyone who gets in their way.

This is my second foray into the world of Harry Potter gaming.  About a year ago I played Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which was a great (though not perfect) game with a well-realized, immersive Hogwarts, lots of challenging combat, fun sidequests and mini-games, Quidditch matches, good-looking graphics, and engaging puzzles.  I went in to Prisoner of Azkaban expecting more of the same.  I was rudely shocked, to say the least.

But before I get into the negative, let's talk about the positive.  In this game, you control Harry, Ron, and Hermione at various times, and each of the three has different strengths and abilities.  Harry has access to the Marauder's Map, which allows you to see mini-maps or the levels, complete with secret passageways and locations of other characters and enemies.  Harry is also able to jump gaps, climb ropes, and is generally the most acrobatic of the trio.  Ron can find secret doors and items.  Hermione can access tight spaces that the others can't.  In addition, though this game offers many spells to be learned and used, most of them can only be used by one or another of the three characters (though the basic spells are common to all three).  All of this does make for a more varied gameplay experience, and adds a certain amount of depth to the (still too easy) puzzle-solving.  Another positive thing about the game is the Expecto Patronus spell, which allows Harry to conjure up a Patronus to use against the Dementors.  This is very well done and is the most enjoyable thing in the game, although controlling the Patronus effectively will take some getting used to.  But that's about it as far as positives go.

Combat in this game is much easier than before.  Your Expelliarmus spell for defense will almost never be used.  The basic approach to any enemy is just cast Filipendo at it over and over again until it goes down.  This is complicated by the fact that your lock-on targeting system in clearly flawed in this game, as many times you will attempt to target an enemy and lock on to an inanimate object instead.  A couple of the enemies are slightly more challenging, but for the post part it is just point and shoot.  This even applies to the several times you will encounter Draco Malfoy in the game.  Malfoy is no more difficult to defeat than any other enemy in the game.  This doubtless makes the game easier for young players, but it was a disappointment for me.

The puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part.  They are made even easier by the fact that the characters will continuously shout out things like ""I wonder what that button does, maybe you should push it!"" or ""Hey Ron, why don't you cast Lumos Duo on that object over there?"" or other such things.  So if you should ever experience some momentary hesitation about what to do next, don't worry - the game will spill the beans quickly enough.

The most annoying thing about the game is the fact that, whichever of the three characters you are playing, the other two will constantly run along behind you shouting unhelpful and annoying remarks.  For example, when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level, but you need to explore the castle a bit, the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every 5 seconds.  Or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level, they will start spouting off about how you're going the wrong way.  This will drive you insane in a hurry.  I can't believe EA thought this was a good idea.  At the least you should have an option to turn the voices off.

The mini-games in this game are dull to say the least.  As I said before, there is no Quidditch, in fact you don't touch a broomstick in the game.  Yes, you do get to fly Buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire, but this is a very poor substitute.  The other mini-games are pointless and boring, and one of them, Owl Racing, was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers, since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly.  I did it one time and never again, since I don't particularly enjoy finger cramping.

Graphically and sound-wise the game is also below par.  Most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts.  The worst is Professor Snape.  I don't know who did his voice acting, but they could have gotten the guy who does Spongebob Squarepants and it would have sounded better.  Of course, you don't hear much of his voice anyway, since every time you encounter him outside of Potions class in the game, he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking - bascially Snape has a year-long bout of emphysema in this game.  What is up with that?

You spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens.  Every time you open a door, even to enter the tiniest room - loading screens.  Running from outside the front door of Hogwarts to Gryffindor tower takes about 2 minutes of play time and about 90 seconds of staring at a loading screen.  This is far too much, and EA really needs to fix this recurring problem in their Potter games.  Other simiar games don't have this problem, why should this one?  It certainly isn't the great graphics.

Outdoors is another disappointment.  Yes, you can fly Buckbeak over a complete version of Hogwarts, but, except for the relocated front door, it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game.  In addition, in the last game, the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle, which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game.  Here, there is no one outside at all.  It's almost enough to make you feel lonely, running over the huge grounds all alone.  Also, in previous games, exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose - there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found.  Here, there is nothing beyond one or two chests with Wizard cards.  Outdoor exploration was one of the best things about Chamber of Secrets, but in this game it is yet another disappointment.

Overall, this game let me down severely.  It's like EA decided that, since the Harry Potter games were intended for younger players and Chamber of Secrets might have been too difficult for them, they decided to make Prisoner of Azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and, in the process, most of the ""Hogwarts"" atmosphere.  (Although, young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the Patronus spell).  Unless you just have to play every game with the Potter name on it, avoid this one.  Play Chamber of Secrets instead.  Let's hope that Goblet of Fire is better.",2.0

"Worst purchase I've made in awhile.  I preordered this through Best Buy and received another Playmaker bundle with 5 MUT packs.  This was in addition to the Playmaker pack and 36 you get form Deluxe.  Opened 2 playmakers and 6 MUT packs on opening night and all I got was a handful of 50s, 60's and 2 Antonio Browns which seem to be the only Playmaker you get in these Playmaker packs.  Seriously... opened 2 playmakers and I get two identical 90 Antonio Browns.  The pack rewards are clearly fixed.

Gameplay- Slowed down considerably from Madden 15.  All players feel like they are walking their routes instead of running.  I don't have lag, just the tempo is very slow and feels clunky.

Defense is non-existent.  Offense can now throw a Hail Mary on 1st and 10 and with the new ""Y' button Aggressive catch, the receiver catches it 85% of the time.  Defense is always 2 steps behind the receiver, so every game I've played in, both myself and opponent finish with 95% completion rates.  Keep in mind this is with my Level 72 MUT team.

Overall- A complete waste of money.  I spent 69.99 compared to what I could have had with Amazon's pre order of the Standard edition for $45.00 just for a handful of scrubs and a fixed Playmaker Antonio Brown thats in all Playmaker packs.",2.0
"This game had me so excited. The concept of secret societies and heavy Lovecraft influence sounded spectacular. Unfortunately, this game is nearly impossible to play, having horrible combat and confusing, overbearing interface.

"The best baseball game I've ever laid my hands on, but it still has a lot of improving to do.  Due to all the work that I think needs to be done.... it only gets 2 stars from me.
For one, game play is difficult. But that's cool. Because that's realistic. Practice. Practice. Practice.
A lot of things have been done well. The players come to the plate, and you can tell who they are by looking at their faces. The movements and throws are very realistic. The atmosphere is sharp. The game keeps track of league leaders and league stats. You have a realistic farm team to work with. Send guys down... bring guys up.
The thing that thrills me the most is the franchise mode. Very cool. I liked playing PC games more than game system games for that very reason in the past... but times change.
Downfalls... AND THERE ARE A LOT!!  There are a lot of animation glitches. Outfielders will wait till the last second and then start to run and make an over-the-shoulder catch almost EVERYTIME. When stealing or outfielders throwing people out at bases, the way the tag looks means nothing. The animation is off. Players will tag the ground on the wrong side of the base and still call guys out.
Walks are very rare. I think I've played 35 games and my pitchers maybe have 5 or 6 walks AS A TEAM (note: I just manage).
I play in manager mode, because that's more fun for me. Yet, there is no way to pitch-out or pitch around. I get a two-strike count to somebody like Bonds or Sosa... you pitch around, yet there's no way to control that. The manual says L2 & R2 are pitch out and brush back, respectively. NOPE. They're both brush back pitches and brush backs usually make contact.
There is no way to do instant replay. There's an automatic instant replay after EVERY play (even pop ups), but there's no way to control it. You can only hit a button to skip it.
Finally, and what I think is the most important, is there is no drama in the commentary. You'll crush a long enough to be a homerun down the line that might be.. could be... a homerun, but the computer instantly tells you... foul ball.
Too many baseball games soup up the power numbers and I don't care for that.  I'm one of those guys that likes baseball exactly the way it is.  This game does that too, but from what I understand, not as bad as others.
Oh, one more thing... the computer changes your lineup without your authorization.  You'll set it, start the game and find that the computer has rearrange things and even started other people.  This severely pisses me off.
Despite all that, it's still the best baseball game I've seen.  There's A LOT of work to be done... but this is definately a step in the right direction.",2.0
"Don't do it! I bought this because I really wanted a landing gear lever of some kind for sims like DCS.

Pros:
-Works flawlessly with FSX

Cons:
-Very cheap, flimsy plastic unbecoming of a product at this price point
-Doesn't work with other sims without 3rd party software.  Yes, I know it tells you this up front, but why on earth didn't they just design it as a universal input device?
-Text is very small.

"The Good: Fully immerses you in games and music, bright vibrant colors, looks futuristic

The Bad: Software and drivers are broken and require fiddling to work, hardware feels like cheap plastic, not much in ways of customization, not many games are supported, the hardware was abandoned years ago

I used these thinking they would be an amazing collection to my PC rig and add some pizzazz, I was half right. Sure it looks great when the lights adjust to the game's lighting, but at what cost? A massive headache that took days to cure.

I'm talking about the lights' god awful software. It doesn't even work, it's broken. Why in the hell would Cyborg release broken drivers and software? You plug in the lights (one in each USB port) and plug up the power to the wall. Install the drivers and software like normal, then things start going haywire. Every program stopped working and crashed when I restarted. I uninstalled the software and it went away. This happened on two computers I installed this on. Why in God's name would Cyborg do this? Not only is the software buggy, but the drivers require you to restart the actual service if the lights aren't working. Some times the software will detect them, some times not. Some times just one light will work. If that isn't bad enough the GenFX detector will cause some games to not start up or crash. Skyrim won't work with an ENB wrapper, and a few other games wouldn't start up at all.

How do you use these lights then? Download the beta drivers from amBX's site. Not quite though. You have to download just the drivers from Cyborg, then the software from amBX. To get the beta drivers you have to sign up to their forum to do so. It also doesn't help that these lights have been abandoned. There hasn't been an update for a few years, yes years. You can't use these lights with music unless you get the third-party Aurora Synesthesia program which is in alpha and was also abandoned. Great, $100 lights that are abandoned. When the lights do work they really immerse you in the music and games. Each light can be adjusted in intensity as well as their position in the room. Each light works separately and displays great colors. The hardware part is good...mostly. The left lens cap fell off for no reason after a few months and one tab broke off when I tried to put it back on. They feel very cheap and are super light and flimsy.

This doesn't sound attractive at all, if you have the PC know-how these lights are actually worth the trouble you go through to get them to work. I loved turning my lights off and being totally immersed in the game with the ambient lighting. What else can you do with it? The lights work with windows popups and errors, you can also customize your own scheme, however, you can't delete detected software from the list. Why? The engineers were idiots that's why. You will end up with an endless list of games that you don't even have anymore, it will also detect dumb things like CCC, various browsers and programs that use DirectX. The software is really buggy and there are few games that directly support the lights in game. Just as less are official profiles for games, because the lights were abandoned, recent games don't have tailored lighting schemes. There are generic schemes, but whatever, it works fine.

Should you buy these? Unless you really want cool looking lights then go ahead. You will have to fiddle with the software and drivers until it works right. 2 USB ports and a power port is pretty demanding. People with limited USB ports will be out of luck. I don't recommend this to the average PC users, but enthusiasts who know what they are doing should go ahead.",2.0
"After the break through in HD quality 720p, the full HD followed it and were now in time where 3D is reality in every house!!!! Wait wait, with Sony eye you will go back to tradition :) where 3D and FHD or HD is not important, your going back to the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the lovely poor colors :)

I thought for the first time I've seen my self on this camera that I'm the hulk since I turned in green color thanks to Sony great Technology.

This camera has a good concept but:

1- image quality is SD don't expect anything, it has the DOOM resolution :)
2- colors are terrible, however you might enjoy it thinking that your turned into the HULK or batman. Believe me when I took it back to the store they asked to check it before refunding me the money and the store manager immediately refunded back the money to me, guys were in the end of 2010 and this is the lowest ever image quality I have seen since 5 years.
Audio Quality: I was astonished by the idea that 4 built in microphones, thinking that I will have a great sound, it appeared that my voice was turned into E.T. Voice some how, my voice is chopped and it was more like robot then human, it's not at all a good microphones, tested on windows and PS3

Good:

1- it has an optical zoom
2- it looks good only.

"Ether One is an interesting title.  While many would call it a ""Walking Simulator"" these days, it's actually a bit more involved than you would think.  I'd love to give Ether One a glowing recommendation due to the incredibly tough subject the story tackles about dementia and the effect it has on individuals, but I'm unable to recommend this title on the Playstation 4 console as it is completely broken.

As a collector, I am currently attempting to obtain all titles published by Soedesco as I am finding myself falling in love with many of the independent titles they're bringing to consoles.  Ether One caught my eye when I came to this page and saw one of the developers (Pete Bottomley ) attempting to get more information from people claiming the title was a buggy mess.  This interest the developer was taking in an attempt to fix this port, quickly lured me into a purchase.  Just to clarify in advance, I purchased this game knowing full well that I was going to experience a game that was nearly impossible to complete due to several game-breaking bugs that I already read all about before purchasing it.  As a gaming enthusiast, this was my attempt to provide the developers with as feedback as possible, so they can get this brilliant title running how it should.

I will now proceed to provide that feedback here as I do feel as a consumer, people should be warned about what they're potentially getting themselves into if they decide to purchase this title.  There will be no spoilers regarding the games story and while I was unable to finish it myself-- I saw several videos of people completing it on Youtube (so I could see the story through) and read the other plot points on the games Wikipedia page.

My first hour within the world of Ether One was smooth and I thought I might get lucky to not encounter any issues after updating to patch 1.02.  It wasn't until I took a break just a few puzzles before the dreaded ""candle puzzle.""  I saved my game from the menu and uploaded it to the cloud as recommended by the trophy guide, due to the games extremely high chance of bugging.  When I returned to the game a few hours later; upon loading my file, I immediately noticed the sound was glitching.  Various sound effects were popping-in and out rapidly; I paused the game and calmly reloaded my save.  This resolved the issue-- or so I thought.  While following the platinum trophy guide on Youtube, I noticed that one of the characters that speaks to you throughout the game was not speaking on my game and her subtitles weren't showing as usual.  I knew this was bad news, but I pressed-on as it seemed like the puzzles were still allowing me to proceed.

I proceeded with extreme caution at this point and began saving on save file 2, in an attempt to keep my one good file that was working fine before I took a break.  As I proceeded to the candle puzzle I mentioned above, this is when things began to plummet quickly.  Following the video walkthrough (and several texts faq's), I was completely unable to get the puzzle solved.  The projector that is supposed to repair itself, would not do so-- regardless of any actions I attempted from the various guides.  This is when I began digging deeper on this puzzle specifically.  I found dozens of threads on Steam about some desperate individuals even attempting to restart the entire game and were still unable to complete this puzzle upon their return.  I followed any trick people said they got to work for them and still had no luck.  In a desperate and anger-filled rage, I began placing the bible on any flat surface in the area and frantically lighting candles and then quickly blowing them out; after 20 minutes of mindlessly attempting to trick the game (by using quick and frantic actions)-- eventually, it worked-- the solution made no sense as the correct amount of candles were not even lit and the bible was not on the correct podium as instructed by ANY guides.  I thought I may have been in the clear as this was the most discussed bug in the game.  I was very, very wrong.

This would happen several more times during the game and the final straw happened just about an hour before completing the game.  It was always a similar situation.  I noticed it always started around the sound glitches it seemed.  Every time the audio popped or characters would stop speaking like they were suppose to (based on the guides I was following), I knew I was about to get the game-breaking bug.  Every time I knew I was going to get hit with it, I did. I would complete the puzzle and since the audio effect that occurs when completing a puzzle wouldn't go off, the projector wouldn't repair itself so I could move on to the next puzzle.  At several points, I actually heard the audio queues and the projector still wouldn't do anything.  I could even scroll down in the video guide and see people complaining about the same bugs in the Youtube comment section.  Some people getting by just fine and others furiously leaving their frustration behind.

It seems the game just doesn't register the completion of its own puzzles correctly.  Not only are some of them so obtuse (I seriously don't know how some people figured many of them out at all), but everyone seems to complete them differently-- and it's not that the puzzles are random, they're simply just broken.  The projectors never seem to trigger consistently, every time that one actually repaired itself without having to reload a checkpoint, I was thrilled.  That is how exhausting it is to play this game on the Playstation 4.  It seemed a lot of PC players are still struggling with the candle puzzle, but that version sounds far less broken then what console gamers would eventualy receive.

From what I hear, it was more of an issue with the developers jumping from Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal Engine 4.  Even with that sympathy in mind, I'm still not quite sure how they didn't catch this.  Ether One needed several more months before being launched.  Especially, as a free PS Plus title; I'm even more shocked that Sony (with it's stricter QA policies) allowed this one to get by.  The digital version suffers from many of the same issues, it's not unique to the physical version published here by Soedesco.

Even with all this ranting; this game is worth playing, if they can manage to fix it.  I know how it ends and the story is fantastic and the voice-acting is some of the better I have heard from an independent title.  The game looks beautiful as well and the color palette is stunning at times.  I was most impressed by the games steady framerate.  I mean, it runs perfectly-- until you encounter one of the many bugs that is!

While I am determined to get through the bugs and complete my save file of this title, I can't say I'm not disappointed it turned out even buggier than I could have imagined, even based on what I read.  Mr. Bottomley, your team has far more work to do; though with that said,  I'm fascinated by the daring attempt at telling a story of this magnitude and complexity.  I highly anticipate the teams next venture into this entertainment medium and hope these issues do not haunt your talented studios next amazing project.  Good luck and until I can report otherwise, proceed with extreme caution gaming enthusiasts!",2.0
"No way near the caliber of the Michael Jackson Experience.  Just Dance 2's graphics are cheesy and most of the dance routines are silly. The dance routine for the song ""Funkytown"" is completely ridiculous.  After playing that song I wanted to throw the game away. Many other songs have mediocre dances to them.

After excelling at the Michael Jackson Experience, I found it difficult to adapt to the jerky dance styles in this one.  There is no emotional connection to the dancers.  The dancers just come off as being annoying and silly.......and they want us to mimic their hair-brained dance moves.

Just Dance 2 is definitely a fun party game and a great work-out.  Almost all the the music is upbeat and very nostalgic, with hits from the 70's (and possibly earlier) to now.

In my opinion:

Pros:
Fun party game
Great work-out

Cons:
Cheesy and slightly ugly Graphics
Song list contains a few extremely odd song choices
The dancers' hands look like blobs of color most of the time and it's hard to tell how they are specifically positioned during the dance.
When correctly performing a Gold Move, the Wii-mote does not vibrate like in MJ Experience.

"- Making the combat system dependent on one-time use stickers was a colossal misstep, especially when some stickers have a very low drop rate, meaning that it's difficult to master certain moves
- Kersti (the Navi of this game) gives completely useless hints when a puzzle isn't completely obvious. In general, the game and its use of special items (bowling balls, fans, etc.) doesn't attempt to give any sense of hints. If you don't have the right item for a boss, you could be SCREWED.
- One particular area of the game stretches on forever (World 3). This section seems artificially lengthened to make the game seem substantial.
- There's no advantage to combat: you don't level up, you don't get incredible drops (most of the time), and you lose the stickers that you use in battle. Guess they forgot what made 'Thousand-Year Door' one of the best games on Gamecube.",2.0
Good movie if your into watching movies instead of playing video games.  To me it was like watch movie pick choice watch movie pick another choice.  There wasn't much time spent playing a game.

"The design and concept are very good.  The portability is nice and the design is sleek while supporting functionality very well.  However, as has been noted elsewhere, I began receiving ""Disc Read Error"" within 6 months of purchase.  Unfortunately, I was beyond the 90-day return limit for my purchase (from a retail store, not Amazon), and I only experienced a problem with select DVDs (all games worked fine), so I didn't pay the issue much mind.  Then, due to life circumstances, I rarely used my Ps2 Slim for about 8 months, outside of two Ps2 games that I played sparingly.

So... after that time period I came back to using my Ps2 Slim with regularity.  The problem had magnified, and now the system would only irregularly play Ps1 games, it wouldn't play most DVDs, and it started showing errors on select Ps2 games.  I keep all of my games and systems in good condition, so wear and tear was not an issue.  And as I'd mentioned, I'd only used the Ps2 sparingly in the months prior, so it hadn't experienced substantial use.

Anyway, the condition gradually worsened until it verged on unusable.  I contacted Sony about the issue, and they wanted to charge me $50 plus shipping to fix what was clearly their own defective product.  I ended up ditching it and (thankfully) finding a decent-condition ""chunky"" Ps2 to replace this dud.  So, ""buyer beware"" with this one.  This poor experience, particularly the lacking customer service aspect, has actually led me to think twice about purchasing a Ps3...",2.0

"Being a die hard nfl fan i always get madden on the release date. Even after hating the demo,buying the season ticket and hating that i still went ahead and buy this game. I pre-ordered on walmart.com and the only good thing that came out of getting this game was walmart sent me two copies for the price of one so i basically doubled my money.
To the game review
The graphics are very good,but the gameplay is terrible. Its super unbalanced.
The passing game is super hard and the rushing game is super easy. In my franchise mode i used matt ryan and had 2tds and 11ints after playing 3games. Its not me since iv seen allot of people saying the same thing. Every time you will throw it it will get batted or picked.
The rushing game seemed unfair just as much. I had adrian peterson on my team(i do fantasy draft)and after 3games i had 500yards and 10tds but not one broken tackle. You cant truck anyone at all. All it is,is breaking through holes.
The commentators are pretty bad as well. They say the same thing about the same player over and over and over""karlos Dansby out of aurburn is a really force to be reeking with""every single game. Also gus says a few racist comments like when a black guy is running for a td he says""hes got run away from the cops speed""
The new thing iv heard about this year was the team entrances but they are pretty lame. They make the game like your watching it on tv but not once have i watched a game and you see the team running out like they do in madden12.

"I was addicted to Contra as a kid.  On the old NES, there was hardly a better game, and I spend hundreds of hours on each one, fighting, shooting, blowing stuff up.

Then I got bored.  Fast.  I couldn't believe it.  I played for about 20 minutes and couldn't take it anymore.  I shot some stuff, but it just wasn't fun.  One of two things happened.  Either this game is horrible compared to the old games, or I just plain grew out of Contra.  I hope it's the former.

"A great board game / RPG combo.  The game creators had a great sense of humor and the art is really fun.  You work your way around the world to save it from evil, bashing each other all the way to try to stay on top.  The game uses rock-paper-scissors as it's base and all contests seem to be some form of this game.

The game is balanced to be rather easy to play, expect to kill a lot of the bad guys in one hit.  To balance this the creators threw in tons of ways to curse and hinder each other.  It make cooperating almost impossible, the best you can do is avoid hurting each other, but even that is inevitable sometimes.

The game is rigged to boot, even if you're a halfway decent player, expect the game to pound you to pieces to ensure you never get out of last place. It's designed for whoever is the game's 'favorite' of the chapter to pull ahead, if you're not the favorite then there's little hope to get anywhere.

It's really sad because the game has so much awesome packed into it! But rather than having an honest random number generator, it's got that rigged nonsense that will leave you trying to get into a castle for months on end while the AI's zip around the map getting perfect rolls every time.

It was practically impossible to get it to recognize my mouse buttons, and had to work around it by mapping keys in another program to my mouse buttons, then mapping those keys in the game.

"MW3 the biggest launch in gaming history.  Supposedly the best,  but that is what the sheeple mainstream would have you think.  Ultimately I wasn't expecting much from this game from the skeleton crew of MW3, Sledgehammer games and their lack of FPS experience before hand and the fact that COD has become nothing more than a mindless run n gun with bad plots, forgettable characters, more explosions per frame than actual filler, not only this but BF3 blew me away.

The campaign is about 3-5 hours long on normal and probably about 7 on veteran.  It's your standard COD campaign filled with explosions and cheesy voiceovers, the singleplayer feels more like a COD deleted scenes with BF3's multiplayer in it.  What I mean by that is they try to hype it up to be WW3 but there's only about 3 missions with actual huge intense battles.  Everything else is just shooting galleries and corridor shooting.

I never tried specops in my 2 days playing this but I played MW2 so I think I get the gist of it.

The multiplayer is the same thing as MW2.  The only difference is theater mode, a few perks, guns, and maps.  Back in the 90s a game like this would sell for 30 bucks and be called an expansion pack.  It's fun don't get me wrong but as a game this sucks.  They haven't changed anything at all.  Besides from the killstreaks and terrible community there isn't really anything special about this game, it's got almost nothing going for it.  The maps make it so going with a rifle or LMG is almost impossible and the maps are tailored specifically for crackheads hyped up on doritos and mountain dew running around with SMGs.  All it takes to do good anymore is just to spray n pray with an SMG.

This is why Halo lost it's throne back in 2007.  It became a spray n pray.

"Lately there have been a number of games made based on classic movies (From Russia With Love, The Godfather, Scarface), and they've all had mixed results, and for those expecting anything halfway decent out of the video game adaptation of Quentin Tarantino's debut film should steer clear of Reservoir Dogs.  The game basically runs parallel to the film, with many of the scenes from the film re-done in full CG effect, though many of the cutscenes look pretty bad.  Your job is to carry out missions based on events that you only heard about in the film; ranging from car chases, dodging cops, and above all, taking hostages to survive.  What's really sad about Reservoir Dogs is how quickly boring the game gets.  While you can choose to be a violent psychopath or a smooth professional criminal, either way the game gets pretty boring pretty quickly, and taking hostages doesn't really do much to the already lame AI.  The best thing about the game is by far the audio and voice acting, even if Michael Madsen is the only cast member to lend his voice to the game.  The graphics are choppy and the controls serve their purpose, but beyond that there isn't anything here that we haven't seen or heard before, and it hardly does justice to the source material.

"Sounds like a good idea right? With the Wii, there are many customizable attachments to add to the controllers for that added touch of realism e.g. Links crossbow, golf clubs, etc...why not boxing gloves?

The problem is that these are basically bag striking gloves with a pouch sewn in and foam inserts. I noticed the following problems that this quick ""port"" causes;
- The glove fit tight (like striking gloves should) but that means if/when you clinch your fist the gloves will depress one of many controller buttons which of course can do things like turn your Wii off to exiting the game.
- No IR window for the sensors. The glove dramatically reduce the range and accuracy of the controllers due to the damping effect of the gloves outer shell
- No access to any control buttons. Hope you like only jabbing cause accessing that coveted ""z"" button for the knock punch just ain't gonna happen.

Their is no pause button, and the game, since this is still the 1990's has an auto save feature...No saving at a convenient spot and then dying and going back to that spot and starting over... no sir, that'd be to nice.

If you get the urge to use the bathroom at a point where enemies are around, you better hold it unless you want to die. Getting an important phone call that real life is throwing at you? But your in a serious situation in the game, some where your working hard to accomplish a goal? Well the director says tinkle on you... better decide quick!

You will have to sacrifice both your real life and your in game life to make it anywhere in this game. Like literally the amount of souls, even with the soul ring.. that they give out is pitiful. So this game requires a TON.. A TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON of time and farming. I can't emphasize this enough. The way the summoning is set up.. its like a gate. If you defeat the boss you can't someone anyone to farm with you. If you defeat the boss though, no one can invade you.. so your humanity is safe.

This isn't the first multiplayer game I have played. So I am not going to heap praise on this system like every everyone else, going to go against the flow here. As a matter of fact, it down right sucks. I know there are a bunch of fan boys that would hoop and holler being able to summon friends whenever would break the game. TO them I say, no sir it wouldn't! The system is already in place to summon people, randoms whenever you want, but it sucks and doesn't work all the time. Its already broken.

And speaking of summoning, you can only summon people near your rank, so if you want to have your friend who's a higher rank, help you? forget it... want to help your lower ranking friend? forget it. This is truly a broken system. Now the director of the game can state he had this vision that he didn't want ruined, personally I think he wanted to troll people and make money from it at the same time. No seriously, from what I understand the Director was inspired by the ' Berserk Manga Series' its pretty awesome! But even in the dang manga, Gatts has a ton of help from Nakama.

Oh also, in this game, YOU CANNOT PARTY CHAT.. I can't emphasize this enough. This game, if you try and go into a freaking party chat it will boot you to offline mode. What a crock of *Insert some serious cursing here since amazon censors or will not allow strong adult language* you know what. So not only will this game not allow you to play with friends unless you get lucky and can summon them.. But it won't even allow you to talk to your friends either..!? (two freaking huge steps backwards for gaming) unless private chat, and then its just one person. I guess the Director was afraid of all the rage combined in one party chat might destroy the universe? Not sure.

The gameplay, do you like your character, kicking or doing a plunging attack at the worse possible time? Even though you didn't activate the attack sequence? Yeah, me either. Really makes you rage, when it causes you to get killed. Like your character to start an attack animation that you can't interrupt that causes him to die? Well better get used to it. Welcome TO DARK SOULS.. the game that will indeed turn your soul bitter black.
The controls of the game, need re-worked, moves during combat need to be easier to pull off. The programming behind the moves needs to be vastly improved, so that a player doesn't have to fight against the controls.

Now to another topic. . . In game experience/resources.

The way you level up your character, in game, is you kill enemies, and you gain soul points. The way you level up your weaponry in game, and your armor, is you kill enemies and get soul points.

So, we have, You, your weapon, and your armor. That is three things competing for souls. The enemies, are far and few. Your weapons, armor, yourself... all require a ridiculous amount of souls to get anywhere useful. SO, we have a MAJOR, MAJOOOOOR broken game, and this is even with the patches that has come out. You go help someone kill a boss,if your lucky and can get summoned and you might be lucky to pull 15,000 souls or something. And do what with them? Not much, maybe buy a titan shard.. repair your equipment? But that's about all. Its a 3 to 1 ratio not in your favor.

You get a 'Covetous Silver Serpent ring', about 3/4 of a way into the game.. which I guess is not accurate since you can go anywhere in the game as long as you can survive. Actually you have access to the catacombs right from the get go, If as a level 1 right at the beginning of the game you can make it all the way to that ring, I commend you! For anyone who has played the game, pinwheel skeletons probably come to mind and a horrible cheap death as well.

The thing about it this whole concept of this game.. and summoning system, is its all broken.. its great in theory, but in execution, the game director or whoever was ultimately in charge, didn't have any common sense what so ever... nor good judgement. Now I know a lot of people, or it seems to at least be quite a few, have made the game work, they've beaten it, and probably caused grief by invading others worlds. They have manage to over come all the difficulties, and strive ahead. How? besides the skill part, I would say a bit of dumb luck as well and a ton of time.

Armor and skill and weapon attack power play such a crucial role in this game.. and so do ranged attacks with the bow. And you'll constantly be struggling to literally both climb up hill as well as get your gear up to snuff.
And it will be a long climb. It will be difficult, and it will not quote :""Extremely Deep, Dark & Difficult - Unforgiving in its punishment, yet rewarding for the determined - learn to strategize freely and conquer seemingly impossible challenges.""

Yeah anyone would be happy when torture is over..

The enemies have an uncanny ability to lock onto you.. from close combat, to long range combat, not to mention, long range combatants, well their arrows will be slightly homing, thus making them a little harder to dodge, than an arrow that's just going straight like its supposed to.

I think the biggest kicker though, is you know those soul's I mentioned? the one's that you use to upgrade yourself, your weapons and armor? Well if you die, they don't stick with you, they fall out on the ground. Now you have once chance to make it back, WITH OUT DYING, to get them back. Because you see, their is no way to store them at the bonfire, or in an item, and losing real time trying to get somewhere in game, is not punishment enough. SO you screw up and lose a lot of souls, you know the one's you were trying to save up to buy an item, or level up? Well YOUR S.O.L!

Okay, now onto the good things about the game. Because indeed their are some wonderful aspects to this game.

Pros:
+You have this massive world that you can't explore, because everything beats you to a pulp, so if you like to explore/adventure? tough poop!
+You have a wonderful variety and colorful group of enemies and bosses
(some of said bosses are really cheap, actually most of them are in their abilities)
+You can have a mishmash of classes.. another words cleric mage, fighter mage, fighter cleric etc.. but you really won't get anywhere, since it takes a ridiculous amount of souls to level up.
+You have these wonderful bonfires that you can rest at, but even if your setting at one you can still be invaded if your human by some grief inducing fool.
+You can warp amongst bon fires once you manage to get lucky and summon some help to defeat probably the most annoying bossess in the game.. er well, some of the most annoying bosses. That one with the two dogs is pretty bad.
Also you can only warp to limited bon fires..not all of them
+The Armor sets in this game are truly awesome, and I really do like how you can layer them to get different benefits. That truly is a pro. No sarcasm here this time.
+The weapons you can get, quite a variety (and if you can actually find the resources whether its souls or titan chunks or whatever, you can get some pretty cool stuff, good luck heh)

If they would fix the multiplayer, the leveling of yourself and your armor and weapons, basically the lack of resources in game... and make it where you could actually grow your character in a consistent time frame...to face the threats that exist. . . (I'm honestly surprised they didn't have micro purchases in this game, they probably wanted to) This struggle for resources is partially what makes this game so freaking difficult. If they made the bosses.. where they were actually on par with you, as opposed to freaks of nature, that would be nice as well. When you face a boss that's literally hopping all over the place, and you can't keep up with ranged weapons, or magic attacks.. etc.. its a real balance issue..

So, Welcome to the world of Dark Souls! Try not to go hollow playing this game. Also, might I suggest you buy this as well&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everlast-70-Pound-MMA-Heavy-Bag-Kit/dp/B004CY3HHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everlast 70-Pound MMA Heavy-Bag Kit</a>. This will save you on LCD TV's and Game controllers.

P.S. I never said the game couldn't be beat the way it is. I never said you couldn't make it anywhere in game. You can. It'll devour your real life time like a world eating champ at an all you can eat buffet though.

P.s.s
If you want a game that truly rewards you for leveling up your character, and that really gives you a sense of satisfaction as you grow, and has pretty good balance, but not perfect.

"After playing Half Life 2, it's hard for other shooters to deliver. My biggest gripe with this game is that it consistently fails to live up to its potential as a survival horror game, and as a shooter.

There is waaaaaay too much exposition and way too many extended cut scenes with so much background and this and that and . . . blah! Just let me play the friggin game already!  Then, right when you get used to the controls, WHAMMO! No more weapons, just a knife and have fun getting killed six times while you learn to use it .

The layout of the maps is linear to the point of feeling like a rail shooter, which works great when you're actually on rails ( souped up train car thing), but feels limiting and uncreative while traveling on foot.

The crescendo events are really just gobs and gobs of the same enemy owning your face to the point of stupidity. This makes the game feel less tactically challenging and more technically challenging, in other words; can you aim, reload, use a med kit, and shoot fast enough to not die.

Bosses are super OP, and often appear in a couple of pre-actual-battle sequences where you waste a s#!t ton of ammo and supplies fighting them only to have them shamble off into the swamp, and magically re-appear 2 minutes later with some of their slightly less stupidly indestructible underlings.

This game is really hard. But not in a good way, like in portal, where you have to be clever enough to figure out the answer to a super complicated puzzle, it's hard like trying to beat the last safe room on the rooftop of mercy hospital in left 4 dead, but by yourself. Not my cup of tea.

I have definitely played worse games, and the part with the train track car thing was fun, but that was about it for me.",2.0
"I've never played such a linear MMO in my life to be honest.  You are led around in a very VERY small enviornment from one npc hub to the next with no options for character development beyond super bland PvE and grindtastic crafting until 25.  All quests are either fetch or kill x amount of mob quests, crafting is simply gathering endless resources and sitting there waiting as you craft items, there is no involvement with crafting besides picking which item you want to craft and selecting ok, then waiting.  Flying is a joke since you can hardly ever do it in the zones and the few areas you can fly you quickly run into the ""invisible wall"" phenomenon that prevents you from going further.  All in all it was a major disappointment after the massive hype this game got.",2.0

"Theres not much to say other than this is a thoroughly frustrating game. While there are small instances where you're having fun, the cons just aren't worth sitting through this.
First and foremost, the load times, even if you install this game on your hard drive, are unacceptable. And in nearly every mission, your traveling across 4 maps there AND back. Factor in a bunch of cut scenes and half your time is spent just waiting to play.
Which brings me to the next issue, Saving. The save points can be tough to find, the map can be a little tough to navigate, you can't set waypoints on it, and theres NO autosave function. Which means when the rediculously hard boss you stumble across tears you a new one, you have to do everything over, and wait for all the cut scenes to load again.
Since were on the subject, the boss battles are VERY difficult. It's like they set it up so that you basically have to cheat to win each battle. Especially since they are all much stronger, and about twice as fast as you are. But beat them quick because your on a schedule!
That's right, There's a time limit for EVERYTHING in the game!! So run across 6 maps, kills the boss, rescue survivors, search or weapons and health, but do it quick because if you don't, opportunities to get special items and will disappear forever. After about an hour, you find yourself just trying to avoid zombies to meet time restraints. This game is an contradiction. A zombie killing game, where you have no times for killing zombies.
Throw in some horrible dialogue and voice acting, really lame costumes and you have you're game. Did i mention that they have you running around, looking for this zombie cure that can not be found without a guide?
And one more observation, his daughter looks too much like rainbow bright.",2.0
"Code Veronica is hands down the most frustrating, pain-in-the-butt Resident Evil game in the entire series.  The formula is the same, but the game is horribly imbalanced.  If you don't play through it in a very specific way, it is possible to reach a point where it literally becomes unplayable because you will run out of ammo.  That alone is bad enough, but there are other elements in the gameplay design that were simply not well thought-out, and cause the player a supreme amount of frustration.  For example, bats that will not leave you alone unless you have the lighter.  If you make a certain decision at a certain point in the game, Claire gives up the lighter, leaving you with no defense against the bats.  Then throw in the Bandersnatches, who have a completely unavoidable long range attack.  You end up standing there, trying to fire your weapon as they pound on you.  You're simply trading blows with them, and that's not good gameplay design.  The puzzles too are more convoluted than in previous games, so you often end up wasting precious resources like ammo and herbs as you run from area to area trying to figure out what to do next.  In Code Veronica, zombies regenerate after you've left an area, something which didn't happen in previous RE games.  So the more you run around, the more ammo you're wasting, and the more your chances of being able to continue in the game dwindle.  I've enjoyed all of the Resident Evil games except this one.  It's the stinker of the bunch.  Buyers beware!",2.0

"I per-ordered this game, being a big fan of bio-ware's other games and I even participated in the beta testing. In short, I was really looking forward to this game so I must admit to being REALLY disappointed when it finally came out.

First of all the combat system is clunky, counter-intuitive, and annoying, at best nothing special and certainly nowhere near as good as in DC Universe online (which has the added benefit of being free-to-play). Next, even though I per-ordered the game, I'm constantly being reminded of how much more fun is being had by others who bought some deluxe this, that or the other. Take the cantina on the imperial fleet for example. Tiny and virtually no content other than elevators leading to the so called ""VIP lounge."" Pardon my saying so but I find it quite irritating that much of the content in this game, which already has a high price and subscription fees, is available only to people who want to pay an extra $100 to unlock bonus features. This annoyance turns to rage of course, when the game takes every possible opportunity to remind me that I am a second-class citizen in the Universe for having only per-ordered the standard version when I should have bought the SUPER-DUPER-QUINTUPLE-PLATINUM-DELUXE version intended for proper humans.

These problems aside, the biggest problem at this point is the TERRIBLE customer support. In addition to the fact that the ques take forever and the game is so incredibly buggy that it has made brand-new gaming computer crash, I am currently locked-out, unable to access either the game or the homepage in spite of per-ordering the game, playing it pre-launch, and entering my activation code before the release date for reasons that I can only guess at.

Don't get me wrong, there is potential here but as long as the game is this expensive, this buggy, this poorly designed, this INSULTING, and above all this poorly supported, you will be better-off playing any number of other games.",2.0
If you enjoy unfathomable amounts of pain during your games these are for you. I never knew your head can ache so bad from headphones. On top of this the audio isn't the best. Also these will randomly disconnect from your computer pretty frequently when it falls asleep resulting in a reboot :).

Seems like any kills are get are just by dumb luck.  If you're still playing Black Ops, stick with it.  You'll be disappointed with Ghosts.",2.0
"Let me say this WAS my favorite mouse while it lasted.  I've tried a few mice in the gaming mouse market (Razer Deathadder, Logitech G400, G500).  For me I need a mouse with lots of buttons on it.  As I play lots of FPS games having more functions on the mouse and freeing up my movement hand (WASD) is vital to my success.  The ROCCAT Kone XTD had it all, perfect fit, lots of buttons, cool led lights, tracked very well.  All around a great mouse.  Then today two of the buttons just up and failed.  One of the buttons on top literally doesn't click anymore.  It's almost like something in there that mechanically makes the button click broke.  One of the buttons on the side also broke, it's doing the same thing as the top button.  It literally won't click anymore.  And what's really strange is every other button on the mouse does what the broken button on the side is suppose to do.  So if for example the side button is suppose to make me jump in game, and I click the right mouse button my character jumps.  If i click the left mouse button my character jumps.  If I scroll up on the mouse wheel...guess what...my character jumps.  So at this point the mouse is completely useless and it's a real shame.  It seems to me there just isn't the level of quality and durability that other brands offer.  I've had my g400 and g500 logitech mice for years and they haven't shown any issues at all.  And what's worse is the Logitech g500 for example is CHEAPER than the ROCCAT.

TL:DR for lazy folks, There are much better quality mice that are at the same price and cheaper than this mouse that will last much longer.",2.0

Surely a game that puts a priority on story can still have deeper gameplay than this! Beyond Two Souls might as well be a special edition movie featuring alternate endings. For what is supposed to be a $60 video game, that's not a very good deal for the consumer.

All that being said, it's certainly not a one-star game as the production values are quite high. If you really need to own this game, pick it up when the price drops.",2.0

"Once again, EASPORTS had promised me a completely new game and once again, I am left wondering why I even believed the hype.  NBA Live 2003 is at it's core, nothing more than the same game as its predecessors.  However, one thing that is new this year is the hyped Freestyle control.  Though gimmicky at first, it becomes surprisingly intuitive as you try to pull off the variety of different offensive and defensive moves it allows.  For instance, by tapping the right analog stick on the controller, you can pull off a string of killer crossovers or spin moves to shake the defender.  On defense, you can reach for the steal while in an intense defensive crouch and raise your hands to defend against a shot without the threat of a ticky-tack foul.  Without this new feature, NBA Live has nothing really new to offer.
The graphics are clean and smooth, but are overall generic.  Stadiums and crowds look the same and the players cartoonish with exaggerated body sizes and large heads and hands.  Some players are hard to distinguish from each other unless you recognize their tattoos, hairstyle or playing gear.  The cut scenes in-between plays are amusing at first, but quickly become tiresome as they are repeatedly played over and over.  How many times do I need to see my bench react as if I had been shot and beheaded after a foul?  Luckily, you can turn this feature off.  Nevertheless, I did appreciate the humor and the playfulness in certain cut scenes that really captured the essence and feel of an NBA game
Regardless of the graphics, the player animations are smooth and quick.  I don't think I have yet to see the same dunk twice.  Seeing Iverson perform a crossover dribble is pure beauty.  Watching Garnett back down an opponent felt like a battle of epic proportions.  There are also a variety of shots to and from under the basket.  Players will either perform a nifty lay-up or change their shots in mid-air depending on the location of a defender.  Gone are the days of the two foot jump shot that clanged off the rim.
Game play is my biggest gripe.  Though the CPU AI is greatly improved this year, there is such a thing as being too improved.  The opposition hardly misses a shot.  Three-point bombs are almost a given and there are way too many dunks as opposed to outside shots.  In fact, it is common to see field goal percentages in the 70's and 80's during the course of a game.  Though I love how the CPU now runs the fast break consistently as opposed to the previous games in the series, the result is almost always a score for the opposition.  Transition defense is practically non-existent since the CPU seems to always make the correct passes that lead to open shots or dunks.  A little humanity in the CPU could have made things more realistic and less frustrating.  Steals and blocked shots are also too plentiful (Sigh.)
The franchise mode is incredibly bare bones.  There is of course, the standard player retirements, re-signing, free-agent signings, team lottery and draft.  Player scouting and evaluations would have added some dimensions to the draft as in Madden 2003, but they are sorely absent.  (Double Sigh.)  Game options are also pretty bare.  There is the usual one on one game we have seen in previous games and a tutorial explained by panty-fetishist Marv Albert using grainy video game footage, but that's about it.
EASPORTS really needed to up the ante this year to compare with the mighty Sega NBA 2k series.  I was pretty optimistic, but again EASPORTS resorted back to bad habits by releasing the same game with an added feature here and there.  Though the Freestyle control is, dare I say, revolutionary, the problems greatly outweigh the benefits offered by the feature.  Again, they have released a game that is too arcadey and not enough simulation.  Though I have no problem with arcade-type game play, at least give me the option of enjoying a game with realistic shooting percentages, balanced game play, and the challenge of having to work for a score.  Now excuse me while I go play NBA 2k3...",2.0
"I'm sure I'll get lots of haters for this review, but I'm a very experienced and objective reviewer of games, especially shooters, especially FPS, so in my opinion, I know what I'm talking about. I've played hundreds of `em. This one does not stack up and brings nothing innovative to the table. Button (trigger) mashing when you struggle with a Nazi for a gun a couple of times in the game is not a brilliant game innovation. It's a tiny little gimmick.

PROS:

- grenade catch and return is cool (although an exact grenade arc throwing system is not used). We've seen this happen in dozens of movies.

- some minor ragdoll physics

- no bad glitches or something that makes you consult the internet to see what the hell you are supposed to do

- fairly good score

- allows for subtitles

- some decent mass firefights

- some well-placed jeep/tank missions to break up the regular shooter monotony.

CONS:

- when I started playing, I thought I'd put in COD2. looks like many of the exact same bombed out farm houses. Just very derivative.

- graphics are only mediocre despite what anyone else says. Colorless and lifeless. If you think this thing has the greatest graphics ever, you haven't played a lot of games. It simply doesn't. This game uses the rarely known, rarely used in-house developed NGL engine. Not an engine that is used in first or maybe even 2nd tier quality games.

- character physics (movement) is a little jagged, not as fluid as in other FPS and other engines (Unreal3).

- uses the INFINITE HEALTH system of COD2, Splinter Cell DA, GoW, R6Vegas, etc. Get shot a million times, move back, no problem.

- annoying repetitious voice acting (JERRIES!!!)

- cannot bypass cut-scenes. UNFORGIVABLE!

- uses bad grenade throwing system that most next-gen games now use instead of an exact arc system.

- AI = average to dumb, some guys stand there waiting to get shot.

- game is so colorless it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys a lot of the time

- vehicle driving is not the intuitive RTrigger = forward, LTrigger = reverse of all other games; it uses some moronic RTrigger = forward and then makes you press a button to go backward. NOT INTUITIVE!

- no real upgrades or innovations from last title other than those previously mentioned

- the WWII game genre is boring, overdone, oversaturated and tired so much to the point that it is one of the only genres that is routinely ridiculed (for example, by the folks at x-Play). It is done to death to capitalize and exploit the last good war the US fought in, which was so long ago (well over half a century) it has no bearing on the current political climate and dirty oil and strategic wars that the US currently fights in, nearly anyone that fought in it is dead, and none of the gen X'rs playing this game have any connection to it at all. The movie industry is no different; churning out 1 WWII film after another (Clint Eastwood even spewed out 2 in 1 year and people laud him for it). In other words, I'm saying it's an easy and convenient softball genre.

My guess is that when EA's Medal of Honor: Airborne and more importantly, Ubi's squad-based FPS Brothers In Arms: Hell's Highway (both using Unreal3) are released, this title will be left in the dust.

Give me the LAST-GEN Halo/Halo2, Doom3, Half-life2 any day of the week over this FPS. For military shooters, give me any Ubisoft title (GRAW, etc) over this. For historical shooters, I guess this is as good as it gets for now on the 360. You have to go into an alternate WWII/sci-fi genre and/or off this platform to get a good one (Resistance: Fall of Man for PS3).",2.0

"A few years ago, the coolest thing to ever happen to gaming came to the playstation 2.  Wide open game playing.  Give the game player a city and let them go.  Give them a story to follow, but also give them some room to play and create their own story.  Give the gamer multiple ways to accomplish the goals.

This game IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE!!

Time after time while I was playing BATMAN BEGINS I kept going from level to level and situation to situation and there's is only ONE WAY or VERY FEW ways to accomplish each thing.  If you don't do things a certain way... you are riddled with bullets and killed in seconds.

THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CREATIVITY!!  You have no choice but to defeat the bad guys in the EXACT SAME WAY that the GAME-WRITER planned it.

This gets very old... very fast.

Of all superhero games that should adapt a wide-open theme. BATMAN IS IT!!!  Come on GAME-WRITERS!!  GOTHAM CITY for godsakes!!  Let us have some fun.

Please... give us a BATMAN meets GRAND THEFT AUTO mix and we'll love you for it.

Anyway... this game is a thrown together, repetitive mess. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of fun playing as Batman and the graphics are pretty good. But, after completing about half the game, and getting killed 10 times everytime you enter a room with thugs... until you get it down the way the game-writer intended it... the game looses its excitement.

After 2 levels of the game, you are all of sudden in the BATMOBILE or the TUMBELER.  No explanation. No reason. But all of a sudden you are racing through Gotham chasing after dozens of bad guys in cars and running them down or running them off the road. WHY?  I don't know.  There's was no story to it. Or reason. Just... do it.

Thrown together... pointless... repetitive... promotional tool...

I mean... come on...  I can see how hard it would be for someone to actually create a BRAND NEW character like say... RATCHET & CLANK, or Rynn & Arohk, or Claire & Chris Redfield and have the gaming world embrace them... but how do you screw it up when you have an already established character that everybody already loves like BATMAN?

I tell you how... you give them a one dimensional game that is about as fun as figuring out the maze in your local newspaper.  Instead of giving them a game that lets the game player use their OWN MIND to figure out the best way to be Batman.

Give us Gotham City. Give us random crimes. Give us a game where is it up to us if his identity is figured out. What crimes we're gonna fight. Who we're gonna save. The makers of Spiderman 2 figured this out.

I won't buy another Batman game until they give us the wide open Grand Theft Auto format.  Give us GOTHAM CITY to explore.

This game... actually sort of insults your intelligence as an individual. The game writer is basically saying that he's the only one that knows the proper way to fight each thug and each situation.  Keep your creative ideas to yourself.",2.0
"I grabbed this title after reading all the rave reviews and find it a GREAT disappointment.  The rhythm part of the game is fun, but the RPG part is tedious with impossible controls.  I have a very simple gauge to judge how much fun a game is: if I pick it up, start playing, and look up at the clock a half hour later, the game rocks.  Here I stopped playing Patapon after about ten minutes and went back to Pursuit Force 2.  At any rate, I believe there is a reason this game sells for just $20, and it involves the inferior controls and inadequate instructions.  I would recommend this game to RPG fans only.  Rhythm fans will have much more fun with Gitaroo Man, and puzzle gamers will prefer Downstream Panic...",2.0
"GAMEPLAY: Presumably okay for multi-player addicts.
GRAPHICS: Average, flat grounds and environments; nothing to write home about.
SOUND: Again, average -- nothing that we haven't heard before.

I bought this game because the trailers looked fantastic, and the self-proclaimed best single-player ever.

DON'T BE FOOLED!

This is a multi-player game only! I had to spend sixty-dollars to learn this! If you like multi-players, then this is your average run-of-the-mill multi-player. However, if you are like me and, really only enjoy playing single-player, consider yourself warned, the single-player campaign consists of mulit-player maps with AI competing against you. No bosses, no breath-taking missions, just capture the flag against AI.

"The visuals and character designs are cool.

The gameplay is routine but decent.

The story is nothing short of a cliche-ridden travesty with a terrible ending.

It's as if the creator just Googled words like ""psychology"", ""dementia"" and ""insanity"" and just formed a story from the first wiki article he read. No actual research was done and the game comes off as incredibly amateurish and actually somewhat embarrassing. Unless you pay more for DLC, character arcs are left unresolved and the entire experience comes off as unfinished.

Another issue are the recycled boss fights. The initial encounters with the main three villains are intensely fun, but you literally have to do each about three times each. This not only ruins a sense of completion and victory, but also hinders the already insipid plot further by showing you kill these enemies--then having them inexplicably come back to life. It ruins tension and excitement when for the nth time, the same boss appears repeating the same mechanic again and again and AGAIN.

It's a lazy weekend game, but disappointing beyond that. I was hoping the story might be even B-movie good, but it was infinitely worse.",2.0

But it felt like I was having to fight with the kinect to get things to work right. The create your champion thing is pretty cool, scans your face and body.

"Short Review:

Red Dead Revolver has a perfect atmosphere and fantastic soundtrack, but it's lack of checkpoints and brutal difficulty, along with unexciting story and characters don't make it worthwhile.

Long Review:

Video games are by nature, an industry that thrives on changing and evolving, in response to ever evolving graphics and more powerful hardware and technology.  Gameplay wise, it's now pretty much standard practice to have quicktime events, the ability to save where you like, make every other game a free roaming sandbox, etc.  Likewise, some events also die out, such as having to play through the game in one sitting, not being able to save wherever you like, and interactive movies.

Why am I bringing this up?  Because Red Dead Revolver is a perfect example of how some ideas in video games should be left behind for good,and not carried on for years when they should have gone extinct and died long before.

Red Dead Revolver is a third person western shooter has you running around the wild west as Red, a stereotypical bounty hunter who doesn't talk a whole lot and prefers shooting people to rationally discussing problems in the hopes of a diplomatic conclusion.  Years ago, your parents were killed in a fiendish raid on your house, and now, decades later, you finally have a chance to take revenge on those who tore your life apart.

Like virtually every other third person shooter on the market, Red Dead Revolver (RDR) has you running around levels, shooting bad guys, taking on boss characters, gathering weapons, and going on sneaking and infiltration missions, among others.  In fitting with the western theme, you get to partake in numerous cliches, such as train robberies, ghost towns, mines, and desolate forts.  And just like with it's successor, Red Dead Redemption, RDR absolutely oozes atmosphere from every angle.  The environments you run through are distinct and varied, and it's always a treat to see what each level has in store, from a train battle on the wide open plains, complete with fields of golden grass, to outposts lit with an overcast sun, to ranches nestled amongst the mountains.  Rounding out the atmosphere is the spectacular musical score, which perfectly embodies the feel of classic Spaghetti Westerns, and the moment you hear it, you really feel like you're in a good, old fashioned western story, ready to hop onto the nearest horse and ride off into the sunset.

Unfortunately however, atmosphere can only take a game so far, and when you start getting deeper into RDR, you begin to realize that it embodies some of the most hated tropes in the world of video games...a high difficulty level, and a lack of checkpoints.

In fitting with the hostile world in inhabits, RDR is a really hard game.  You'll go up against entire armies of outlaws, militias, and private armies who would love to put a bullet between your eyes, and more often then not, they'll accomplish it.  In and of itself, this isn't a problem (save for those with low tolerance for frustration), but what makes it such a huge problem is the lack of checkpoints.  Despite each level being really small, they're packed with enemies and events that you have to take on one after another, and unfortunately, you often have to complete two or three objectives at a time before you get a checkpoint.  This sounds easy, but in reality, it's anything but.  I lost track of the amount of times I died, only to respawn at the very beginning of the level, thus making me fight through everything all over again, especially on some of the more brutally difficult stages.

Unfortunitly, this is especially annoying when it comes to duels, another of the game's biggest problems.  Quick draw gun duels have never really worked in video games, and RDR doesn't break the trend.  The aiming controls are very loose and drifty, and you're always on a time limit before you get shot and killed.  As the game goes on, this limit gets smaller and smaller, until you have perhaps half a second to react, aim accurately, and fire before dying.  The second to last duel for example, took me well almost a dozen tries to complete, and even then, it was pure blind luck that allowed me to pass, not skill.

Still, the difficulty and lack of checkpoints could be forgiven if the the story and characters were fascinating to follow, but RDR doesn't succeed in this front.  As the main character, Red is just not that interesting.  For example, he has just three facial expressions:

1.  Neutral Smirk.
2.  Smug Smirk
3.  Angry Smirk

Coupled with his sparse dialogue, Red just isn't an interesting character to follow, or root for.  The side characters fare slightly better (and in a nice touch, you even get to play as some of them at certain points), such as the Buffalo soldier, the English gunslinger, etc, but they don't get much in the way of development either, besides basic, ""I want to save my ranch from the evil governor"" motivations, and the whole story eventually finishes with an unsatisfying ending that fails to leave any impression on the player.

In a nice touch, after you've completed the single player game, there are some really nice bonuses to unlock, the biggest of which is a duel mode, where you can play against up to three opponents at once in a big shoot out in stages that you can unlock/buy while playing through the main game, and in addition, you can also unlock pages in a journal that acts as a scrapbook.  And there's even a bounty hunter mode, which challenges you to complete levels in certain ways, such as not taking a single hit, finishing it within a time limit, getting kills only with headshots, etc.  Accomplishing such goals will get you some nice bonuses, such as turning blood into glittering stars, invincibility, etc.  All these unlockables really helps to give the game a lot of replay value that you don't see in many other western games, so it's a great touch.

Overall, RDR has fantastic atmosphere, an amazing musical soundtrack, and some very nice unlockables, but the high level of difficulty, and uninteresting story ultimately makes RDR not worth recommending.  What's really sad is that the checkpoint problem shouldn't happen.  Checkpoints in video games should be frequent, not frustratingly sparse.  Never once have I encountered a review praising the lack of checkpoints, for everyone hates to replay segments of a game over and over.  Even hard games, like Limbo for the XBox 360, provide very frequent checkpoints, so if you die, you feel determined to try again, and don't feel like you're being harshly punished for failure.  RDR does give the impression that it's unduly punishing you for failing, even though it's the game itself that's brutally hard in the first place.",2.0

"Mafia 2 isn't the open world game you'd initially hope for, but it doesn't have to be. In reality it's a story based game with some freedom added to it. It always the game to focus on it's mafia driven story-line wish trump's most games. The truly top notch voice acting makes you dive into it's crime driven world. Unfortunately for everything the game does right on that regard I felt more often than not truly bored with the game. While the shooting mechanics are passable, the driving drove me insane. I spent as much of time driving to the location as I did actually shooting and doing missions. It would be fine, but it takes a large portion of the game and eventually becomes tedious. It's a shame cause the missions are truly diverse. The visuals in the game aren't exactly high class. The city is mostly empty, characters are just ""ok"", but textures aren't detailed and overall it really isn't an impressive game to look at, which is surprising. Mafia 2 is a short game, no question. It'll take you from 5-7 hours to beat and there is very little incentive to come back, especially since the story pretty much ends. Overall: Mafia 2 is a great game that demonstrate how far games have come in delivering cinematic experiences. It also does a step backwards in the game-play department and overall didn't feel like much fun.",2.0
"I always used to think of Polk Audio as providing high quality products, sadly that is not the case here.  The quality of construction is that of lightweight cheap plastic.  You know how a good set of headphones feels in your hands.these don't feel like that.  There is a small amount of plastic padding on top of the headband, and that is all the cushioning you get, it even looks a little cheap when you see it.  The audio is average at best, nothing better or worse than any other headset.

The ear pads do rest of the ears well, so you do get some reduction of ambient noise but that it is vinyl clad padding, nothing special.

My biggest issue is with the retractable microphone, at first I thought this was a great idea, then when I turned on the microphone I had terrible static.  I would have to constantly manipulate the microphone to get it one position so the static stopped.  But then the microphone was often away from my mouth and useless.  I am pretty sure this is the result of a bad connection either a broken wire, or bad solder connection.  But without the mic, these aren't useful too me.  I sent an email to Polk and never heard a response.  So be warned if you have similar issue.",2.0
"Driv3r gets 2 stars, simply because it's beautiful to look at, the cops will chase you for breaking the law and the cars sound so sweeeeeet!

 Unfortunately, that's about all that is good.

 The driving aspect isn't so bad either, but it's not as great as it looks on the comercials. The cars handle well, and take more realistic damage, but that can't make up for atrocious game-play with a captial ATROCIOUS!! It was so bad that I only played it for an hour, even though it was a $6 rental. Quickly, here's a rundown of the biggest problems...that I saw (remember, I only played through about 4 missions):

 1. In-car camera view was either 1st person, or behind the car but not high enough to really see over it. I kept wishing I were somehow taller so I could see over the top of the flashing sirens. Grand Theft Auto this isn't.

 2. Tanner, your main character, moves ackwardly and shoots even worse. Even with auto aim I felt like my reflexes were slooooow. Max Payne this isn't.

 3. Way too linear. You have little to no real decision making ability. It's a ""one way in"" and ""one way out"" kind of game. Splinter Cell this isn't either.

 4. Finally, the ""Take a Drive"" function for the non-linear gurus is BORING. There's nothing to do that's the least bit creative. Again, Grand Theft Auto this isn't.

 Bottom Line: They should have kept this as a stictly driving game because it's clear that they don't know what they're doing yet when they have to make the character get out of the car.

 If you're still interested in checking this game out, rent it before you buy--you'll be glad, like me, that you did. Sorry, ATARI, but I have better things to do with my time and money.

 PS: Apparently there is an extensive replay function, but I didn't bother with that. I hear it's the same as Grand Turismo's. Still, not enough to make up for incredibly disappointing game-play.",2.0

Not to mention parts of the town when you look around that look like a 5 year old drew it. No textures on half of the stuff in the game. It's bad. They rushed this game and I feel ripped off for paying $39.99. They should feel ashamed of themselves for bringing this game to market with out finishing.",2.0

It is galling that even after seeing how many people are willing to pay the extra dollars here in the U.S.A. for all the new technologies and bell whistles that come with them that these U.S. companies STILL labor under the impression that anything new here should come half completed, whereas in Japan they get the whole kit and kaboodle.

While the game is somewhat fun, it is basically a different game. It only slightly mentions Red Faction a couple of times. You see a character or two of the Red Faction, and that's about it.
The game doesn't take place on Mars either. That was half the thrill of the other one. You don't really know what your going to run into in mines that are underground in Mars.

"I've loved all of the games in this series, and I have to say that Ascension is probably the weakest of the 4 games that have been released on consoles (I'm not including the PSP versions, which I haven't played). God of War 1 and 2 on PS2 are really great, and I was much looking forward to PS3 graphics for the next game. GoW3 came out and I bought it and played all the way through it day 1. I absolutely loved it, and it was graphically beautiful. The story flows well from 1 to 2 to 3, and I was wondering what they were going to do with this game.

GoW:A is a prequel to the first game. During the first couple games they explained Kratos' back story very well, so I don't really think this was needed. There were some cool concepts in GoW:A, and some pretty visuals, but the story kinda fell flat. I think they ended up spending too much time focusing on the multiplayer aspect that they tried to incorporate vs just focusing on the core 1 player experience, which is the main reason GoW fans love GoW games. If there's ever a 4th game released, I hope they don't make that mistake again. It seems like hardly anyone gave a crap about the multiplayer aspect, and in the making of videos it seems like that's what they were spending all of their time trying to push.

As a collector's edition the game is kinda weak as well. The statue that comes with it isn't very good in terms of quality. The arms are separate from the body and come detached inside the packaging. They just sort of plug on to little plastic posts. It doesn't look the best in terms of detail either. Just like at toy that you'd get at the store, but with no points of articulation at all. The game also comes with an aluminum game case for the disc itself, which isn't too bad - better than a standard plastic case, but isn't anything special either. This collector's edition, as a package, and especially compared to games from companies like Xseed, NIS, and Namco, is weak. Just buy the non collector's version, which I believe now you can get for around $4 used at Gamestop, and play through it.

Better yet, get the HD remasters of the first two games for PS3, as well as GoW3, which is also cheap, and play those. They're a much more enjoyable experience than this. I hope if they release a PS4 version they go back to focusing on a solid story and single player experience and don't waste time with multiplayer again. If they do another collector's edition, a soundtrack disc and a large, full-color, hardcover art book would be cool, since so much of the art in the GoW games is awesome.",2.0
"The story is paper thin, takes itself far too seriously, and is incredibly boring.  The combat is repetitive. The graphics are as bland as the story, and the 'side-quests' are 'go back through this zone for the 5th time and kill 3 widgets'. There are a few hundred side-quests.

MadCatz completely failed to deliver here, which is bizarre given the presumed size of the peripherals market. Then again, the ION Drum Rocker was so popular for RB3 in part because there were no other solid options, so this is likely just a continuation of Mad Catz' last-gen problems.",2.0

Stop focusing on graphics.
Stop focusing on all kinds of extra crap to pile into a game.(Weapon options,skins,this and that).
And focus on gameplay.

"In Homecoming you can really see the struggle to bridge the gap between the PS2 and the PS3's capabilities.

"Been playing EA NHL games since 91, outside of the graphics not much has changed.  Garbage goals still go in, cpu players are still dumb, animations lead to more bad goals than anything.  Goalies are almost impossible to control properly, and defense is more restrictive.  You cant even tie a guy up in front of the net.  Not sure how ""every position affects the outcome of the game"" when goalies are clunky and slow to handle, and defense cant do anything but poke check incessantly, which of course leads to penalties then goals and a winner.  Every year the make the game easier for the casual player to pick up and score goals and less close to real hockey, and the hardcore player who wants a more realistic game.

"If you played Far Cry, then you know what this game is about and what you were expecting. The graphics are fantastic but the game play is on a lower level when compared to Far Cry.

Basically, you are getting more Far Cry! LONG OVER DUE!!!
Excellent graphics.
New weapons.
Nano Suit - give you super human abilities.

CONS -
Linear game play with too many scripted events.(In other words, you cannot venture around and find alternate attack routes as much as you did in Far Cry and as soon as the game hits a save point, you know action is about to happen. It takes away all the surprise!)

BUGGY. This game crashes a lot. You can review different gaming forums and read the horror stories. Pretty pathetic for the excellent team of people behind CRYSIS to have released this clunker piece of manure out before it was well tested! I cannot play for more than 20 minutes without  crashing out. (Yes I am updated and even running the latest NVIDIA beta drivers designed to resolve CRYSIS problems!)

This is kind of just like Far Cry all over again.

Another batch of aliens invades the earth.

Also, the AI was crappy. I found the enemy to be VERY stupid and not very aggressive. In Far Cry the soldiers would come after me, flank me, attack hard. I almost could fall asleep at times waiting for the soldiers to do something!!!!

This could have been the game we were waiting for. Instead, it is a clumsy, half finished, unpolished remake of a great game!",2.0

"Oh dear, where do we start. My brother bought me this game on a whim because he found it for four dollars. Where did he find it? donno. But apparently four dollars can buy you one hell of a frisbee.

Graphics:
Obviously, the first impressions of a game are going to be the graphics. Being released in 2006 should give you a vague idea of what it looks like.  It's kind of stuck between current and next generation engines. They just missed the mark. Not incredibly bad, but no wow factor, especially for today. Being able to see heat is probably the only notable thing about it. Think Far Cry meets Call of Duty... 1. Actually CoD1 looked better than this.

Story:
Laughable. Even for a videogame. I swear a 9 year old must have written this monstrosity. Something about super soldiers, rebels... and that Nazis have to die. I honestly have no idea what it is about. Honestly. I think you play as a german in WW2, but you fight against germans. That's about as much as you are going to get out of it. Then they go off and kill off the only character that you found remotely interesting in a weak firefight... but i swear you see him later in the game... or that may have been someone else... I don't know... all the character models look the same. But in all seriousness, they don't explain ANYTHING. It's a clusterf*#% of bull$@&%.

Game Play:
Run of the mill FPS. You run, you gun. You spray, you pray. The inventory menu is something like PREY where it shows you what weapons you have up top, but you can only carry one of a certain type of gun. That's lame. I mean, I want the cool heavy machine gun, but I only have 7 bullets for it, and I KNOW I'm not going to find any ammo for the rest of the level. So I have to stick to the gun that every german soldier that I encounter has so I have plenty of ammo, but it has terrible aim and I need to unload an entire clip into a guy to bring him down. Stupid. Just let me carry all the guns. The story is unbelievable enough; let me believe that my ""super soldier"" can rambo it and carry loads of steel. Also, the enemy AI is a tad too aggressive. Especially when you can spit more accurately than shoot. This is the first FPS I've played where aiming down the scope doesn't actually help. You walk into a room, or stand in front of a door, and you know a handful of baddies are going to run in, and they all know exactly where you are. Even when you are hiding behind something, they pour bullets on top you with pin point accuracy. Maybe I'm supposed to make use of my 'superpowers' or should I say 'superpower,' the time shield, an interesting concept. By pressing the Q button, I can put up a blue bubble around my character that stops bullets from reaching me. Okay that's pretty neat, but give me something else! Geebus I was bored with it by the second stage, in fact I forgot that I even had it because it only lasts a few seconds before it has to recharge. And what's with the HUD? I can understand the health and ammo numbers, but what's the blue bar? Does that have something to do with my time shield? What are the skulls and symbols for?! SOMEBODY CLUE ME IN ON THIS... PREFERABLY THE DEVELOPERS! and saving... don't get me started. I got hella far in a level, and had thought that I hit a check point because a small message appeared when I reached a certain area. But when I walked up a stair case some nazis shot something that exploded right next to me, killing me instantly. I thought to myself, 'okay, that's alright, the devs probably just wanted to make it fun by having me learn from my mistakes and retry the area knowing the ambush awaits.' However I was pleasantly pissed when I found that I had to restart from the beginning of the level. I shut it off and walked away. I can only take so much crap in one sitting. Is it so hard to make an auto save feature?

Level Design:
...or lack there of. Each location is tedious and awful. Some doors open up to rooms with absolutely nothing in them, no ammo, no health pack, nothing. Just some chairs, and maybe a window. They serve no purpose and in these types of games I don't exactly feel like exploring. This beats the doors that don't even open. I normally wouldn't nit pick at that, but when the doors that are painted onto the walls look EXACTLY like the ones that do open, it gets a little frustrating. Change the color, put a symbol on it, make it flash, SOMETHING. The general layout of each level is either predictable or awkward. Narrow alleys, maze like complexes, long stretches with no cover, it never ends.

Audio:
The FX is decent, but the voice acting is what I really wanted to rant about. This is some of the, no this IS the worst voice acting I've ever heard. I would say you need to hear it to believe it, but I hope you don't subject yourself to this game in order to find out. Just take my word. It lacks emotion, proper casting, and general talent. Some say that it is on par with Far Cry, but i respectively disagree. It's so far below, and I thought Far Cry's voice overs were awful. I cringe every time the protagonist speaks and the female lead does a wonderful job at making me laugh with every line. The Nazis don't help either. They sound remarkably like... Americans.

Bottom line, this game is not worthy of your time, nor hard drive space. Even if it were gifted to you, I would say it could be used for something else, like replacing that sugar packet that stabilizes your kitchen table.",2.0
"Bought the controller in March. Now it is completely unrecognized in Windows. No lights come on when connecting it, even to other computers. It's a shame because my previous Afterglow controller lasted probably 5 years.",2.0
"Like others said, it's a $30 game (at most) with a $60 prices tag.

Pros:
- Excellent Graphics
- Good controls
- Online Battles are fun (though get old quickly)
- One of the only PS4 games that allow single-console multiplayer, (I WANT MORE OF THIS!)

Cons
- NO story mode what so ever.... I mean really? Nothing? From a franchise that is built on story... I mean sooo much story they somehow couldn't come up with anything for this? Even a one-to-one story of the original trilogy would have been better than nothing! Minus 1 Star
- Maps are quite small, and not enough of them. Minus 1/2 Star
- Extremely limited on what you can actually do, you pick where you want to battle, you pick which character you want to play as, and that's basically it. Minus 1/2 Star
- Single console multiplayer doesn't have nearly as much content as online multiplayer, in fact most content is reserved for online play... turnoff for me, especially if you don't have an online account. Minus 1/2 Star
- At $60 I was expecting a lot more game. Waste of money in hind sight. Minus 1/2 Star

I got bored with it after about an hour of playing. The $15 single console multiplayer game I got to justify multiple controllers was more fun than this. If you want a real game go buy MAD MAX, I got that game for less than Battlefront. Its perfect for those who got the ""disappointed because it did not live up to the hype"" blues. Granted, no multiplayer but hell of a good story compared to none at all.",2.0
"I have to admit, for the 10 months that this headset (which I purchased for about $120) was functional, it sounded great. Other than it being a bit uncomfortable (I have a larger head with a hat size of 7 3/4) and a little warm on the ears, it was very solid and I was pleased with it.

After 10 months of use, however, the right can popped right off while removing it from my head. I'm not hard on peripherals, I store them carefully and be sure they aren't dropped - there's no reason the can should have broken off. After some research, I've learned I'm not alone, that many folks have suffered from this design flaw.

In short, good headset, but for the price it should be considerably more sturdy.",2.0
"After working through an arduous verification routine and dealing with customer support I was able to get the game to work. I played the games for several hours hoping that I would experience the same fun that other reviewers expressed but it is just ok.

Nothing groundbreaking here. It is basically the same game as the first StarCraft with better graphics. In some ways that is a good thing but they could have done so much more. It ended up being repetitive and boring and I soon lost interest.

We'll be seeing this game in the bargain bin.",2.0
i am a call of duty[MW2] fan having good controller is absolutely necessary so i bought this product thinking it would enhance my gameplay  but i was wrong.this controller feels right it's very sturdy pairs easily with my ps3 but when playing online i noticed that aiming was very difficult this product does not give you the precision aiming like the sony controller especially long distance kills overall this is a good controller for basic games but when it comes to CoD[MW2] i would recommend sony controller,2.0
"I've been playing PC games since around 1991, well before Windows came out.  The first Max Payne was a world changer, and MP2 was even better.  With these games, I don't use multiplayer at all, so I can't comment on that part of it.
But for the Single Player, for me the game is ruined.  First off, I don't like games that have no Player Saves.  This one has way too many and too long graphics movie segment.  In some places, all the movement from one scenario to the other is a cinematic set piece, so there is little problem solving necessary, which is part of the fun  of these games for me.  The player is then thrust into a shootout, without any familiarity with the locale.
If you like only the shooting part of FPS games, you'll likely  like this game.  If you  like a complete game experience, including solving the problems of landscape and strategy, they've removed most of that from the game.  It's a shame.",2.0
This is not a game it is a completely computer rendered movie with good Dialogue decent story and wonderful music.  The problem is I play video games to play and this title lacks gameplay in a woeful manner.  You switch modes so there is some upclose gun battles alot of em in fact thats all the gameplay really consists of besides wandering around.  The hunting mode is fun for about ten minutes until you master it.  I would buy this game for under  twenty bucks and be happy with the entertainment value I got from the FMV's and the soundtrack both of which are incredible.  If you are looking for a scary little movie that you push along you might just like it but rent first.,2.0

"Spider-Man has been in a lot of games in his career, from his first adventure on the Atari to the recent game for the Playstation. Between the two, this Genesis game came out and it didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire. What you're looking at here is a very average game that doesn't do our friend Spidey justice. The gameplay is just too bland and repetitive for it to be fun. While it does have plenty of his best villians, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Graphics are good, sound is okay, but there are better games out there. Sadly, the Playstation Spider-Man game has been the only game to truly capture what Spidey's all about.

"MY OPINION:
I've tried to like the whole Dead Rising series but have ultimately never been able to last more than a few hours past the first few games and now this.

Combat is not that exciting to me due to the fact that it just doesn't seem very interactive its just slashing peoplw with a button etc. Sure the weapons are interesting but they expire.

At this point I'd save up for a different game instead",2.0
"I ordered this direct from Sony last Nov when it was released. After using it for both a PC monitor, and 3D game display for few weeks I noticed it would blink. The screen would flash black for a second or 2. It would happen once or twice a week so it wasn't too big of a deal, but I Googled the issue and found others had similar issues and faulted it to the HDMI. So I lived with it for awhile and tried a few different HDMI cables and still had the same issue. Still the problem was so infrequent, I could deal. Well over the past few weeks things have taken a turn for the worst and it not flashes at least 10-15 times per day. Is it dying on me already? Im calling Sony on this Monday, and hoping they deal with the problem. I've had nothing but horrible customer service from Sony in the past, so I fully expect them to give me a problem. Do not buy this TV. This flashing/black screen problem is very widespread. Just Google it and see for yourself.

""UPDATE!!!!""

Since this review I have contacted Sony. I gave them a call and to my surprise they didn't give me an issue. The sent me a box with a pre-paid label from Fed Ex so I could ship it back to them to get the problem fixed. I shipped this display back on a Friday, they got it the following Tuesday and shipped me a brand new one that day. After using the new 3D display for a little over a week, im starting to get the exact same blinking problems as the old one. Im going to hold off a bit before calling Sony back again. If/when this blink gets worse, I plan on calling them back. Two different displays with the same exact issue, plus countless complaints online about the same thing. Sony must know this is a major issue and to my knowledge hasn't even acknowledged it. I will post updates as to what happens.",2.0

"REVIEWERS NOTE: Throughout this review the product is referred to as Dragon Quest VII and not Dragon Warrior VII.  They're both the same game, but the truth is: the series is called Dragon Quest.  So don't get confused.  I also refer to the other games in the series as Dragon Quest and not Dragon Warrior.

Dragon Quest is huge in Japan.  The games actually have to be release on Sundays or Holidays because of how big they are.  The Dragon Quest games are not nearly as big in America.  The other Dragon Quest games are actually a real treat--particularly the SNES games that never made it to the states.  Dragon Quest VII does not hit the height of the NES and SNES games in any way shape or form, mainly because this game in particularly, does nothing to actually make the Dragon Quest games mature, and that's really sad.  It's great that they got it together for Dragon Quest VIII, but it can't stop the seventh in the series from being the black sheep of them all.

It's really sad to because of all the Dragon Quest games, the seventh installment is one of the only ones to have a satisfying storyline where things actually progress and you don't spend a lot of time running around so lost you don't know what to do.  It's not a deep story by any means, but it does have more focus here than other Dragon Quest games.  Because of the structure of the story, there's not too much you can explore from the get go, and thus you're limited.

The first thing about Dragon Quest VII that people will note is that the game looks absolutely horrible.  For a late generation PSX game going up against the likes of Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX at the time, this game looks like a rejected Super Nintendo game, and it may be because it was originally in development for that particularly system.  The towns look really bad, the textures are mostly pixelated, the character sprites look horrendous.  Simply put, this is just a terrible looking game.  The sound effects are even worse.  You'll dread each time you have to pick up a barrel and toss it.  You'll dread opening a door.  The games framerate isn't even steady.  The only thing to the games graphical credit is that some of the enemies don't look so bad, and that it's colorful.  Still, even for those who don't base their judgment of a game on graphics will have to take a moment to get used to just how terrible they really are.

The second annoying thing is the menu system.  It's the exact same one that was used in Dragon Quest VI, and it's just a pain to navigate.  In a world where games like Final Fantasy VII made navigating the menu as easy chewing food, Dragon Quest VII makes it a tedious task.  Characters are limited to what they can hold and I don't want to go into the nightmare of equipping and re-equipping characters over and over again.  The menu interface is absolutely horrible.  It seems like such a dumb thing to complain about, but in an RPG released on the Playstation, inventory management shouldn't be so difficult, nor should I have to spend more time in the menu than actually exploring a dungeon.

Combat is also a big problem.  It's not that battling isn't fun.  Firstly, you don't get into a battle for quite some time.  In fact, you'll spend the first couple of hours of the game roaming around not battling anything.  It'll be a miracle if some gamers can even hold out that long.  Especially because it's an RPG with little story exposition in the beginning.  When you do make it to that point though, you'll be met with mixed feelings.  For some odd reason battling is fun, but again, the graphics really make you wonder sometimes.  The battle system is essentially the same as it was on the NES and SNES.  The problem here is simple: This isn't either of the two systems.  I don't mind the combat being menu based, but the fact that you don't see your characters and that they don't physically go up and strike the enemy makes battling feel a little... empty and uninspired.  Some of the enemies actually look pretty good, but I'm bothered that the battle engine is exactly the same as Dragon Quest I from way back when.  Dragon Quest VIII certainly did a far better job in at least making their battles look good.  Here, you just feel as if you're not involved enough.  It's simple, and it is fun because the combat is surprisingly deep and strategic.  Even better the game is a challenge.  But all the while you can't help but thinking you're playing an NES game on a system that is capable of so much more.

They say it'll take you about 100 hours to plow through Dragon Quest VII.  The game is, in fact, huge.  There's tons of sidequests, and just when you think the game is getting stale, they do manage to throw something else at you that gets a little more involved in the gameplay.  The job system, for instance, comes along hours after you've begun your quest, but it adds a lot of variety when it's finally added in there.  Enough to keep you busy for hours.  What a lot of people don't mention about Dragon Quest VII, however, is that a lot of those 100 hours are spent on heavily raising your party to getting better levels and stats.  Dragon Quest is known for making gamers work, and Dragon Quest VII actually does that.  For example, the game will not let you overpower your characters job classes.  There's a point where they do cut you off and you have to advance forward.  However, you've still go to worry about their normal levels, and you don't gain a whole lot of experience or gold from these monsters.  Thus, of the 100 spent to plow through the game, you'll more than likely spend more than 50 hours just leveling up to take on the next challenge.  And Dragon Quest VII is not an easy game.

While the sound effects are bad, the music of the game itself is quite good.  Dragon Quest has always had good music and Dragon Quest VII is no exception.  The game falls short in almost every category except music.  Here's where the game truly shines, and not only that but Dragon Quest fans will recognize some fantastic tunes from other games.

The bottom line is simple.  Is Dragon Quest VII a good game?  The answer is surprisingly, yes.  You just have to really be able to get passed the fact that you're playing an NES game on a system capable of so much more.  Simplicity has kept the series alive at least, but the game seriously looks like a rejected SNES title that they felt they needed to dress up in tattered clothes and shove onto the Playstation.  The game isn't bad, it's just that by the time Dragon Quest reached the seventh installment, one has to wonder why the developers didn't actually make it look or play like a Playstation RPG.

If you can look past the NES appeal, Dragon Quest VII is a great game.  It's fun to battle in (despite it's graphics).  There are tons of mini-games and sidequests to do, and there's so much variety that you'll want to play just for the sheer fact that you KNOW you haven't uncovered anything.  Still, the old school nature of this game is going to be hard to swallow, even for old school gamers.  The game is slow, the menu system is horrible, the graphics are subpar, the battles feel like you're doing nothing.  With these kinds of cons taunting the game, it's hard to recommend it even to die hard Dragon Quest fans.  Fun to play, but it's asking a lot gamers to look past its glaring shortcomings.",2.0

"SO. I am a mouse freak. I'm a collector for some reason. My favorite mouse of all time is my EC1-a by Zowie.  My hands are 22cm. Other mice in my collection: Razer DA Chroma, Logitech G303, Mionix Castor, Mionix Avior, Zowie Benq FK1, Zowie ZA12, SteelSeries Rival, Microsoft Intellimouse 3.0 [rip :( ]. Received the Finalmouse 2016 a few days ago. I wasted my money but luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy and I'll be getting it back. Luckily for you, I'm here to save you money and hassle by telling you to avoid this product.  First off, let me say that through testing this mouse, the performance was great thanks to the implementation of more smoothing in the 3310 sensor which actually I didn't find attractive, personally. Nothing new about the shape. Same old generic OEM shell slapped with a 3310 sensor and sold for 3 times the cost with ESports written on the package. I haven't had the 2015 but I've heard about the poor quality in several batches. Unfortunately folks this one is no different. The side buttons are bad. Real bad. They are a bit loose and rattle when the mouse is shaken. You can also see the white light from the scroll wheel LED in the gap between where the side buttons and the shell itself. The weight sure as hell isn't 74g either. More like 84-87g. Another issue: the left click and right clicks are like loose teeth. Especially the left mouse button. It is wobbly and makes me feel like I'm playing with a cheap 13 dollar mouse (well, because it basically is). They are also horribly soft and way too easy to misclick. Cherry on top: my hands are too large to hold this mouse comfortably. If your hands are 21cm or larger and you're a hybrid claw grip player you won't enjoy the shape. The right side needs to be flat for me. I can't stand the ""ergonomic curvature"" of the atrocious glossy right side. You CAN NOT have this mouse on your desk and feel good about it. At least I can't. And like I said, I collect these things. Filed for return. I'm looking forward to Zowie hopefully putting the 3360 sensor in the next refresh of the ec series mice. I'm also looking forward to more 3360 mice to hit the market. This will be the Finalmouse I ever purchase from Finalmouse.",2.0

"I went through hell with this adapter. All I wanted was to be able to play games for let's plays on my computer. None of my N64 controllers worked right with it. First, the joystick acted loose, while it acted normal on the actual console. I bought three different controllers from a local game shop. None of them worked. The shop started just swapping the controllers for me when they realized how much trouble I was having, thinking it was on their end. I went through perhaps seven controllers before finally taking this thing apart and discovering that the contact points inside were corroded.
I take good care of my stuff. Both my parents took great pains while bringing me up to teach me to respect my stuff, and my dad being an engineer on top of it made me extra aware of what not to do with electronic devices. So whatever caused this to become corroded, I know, was a manufacturer's fault.
I was extremely disappointed by this turn of events, and the adapter went headlong into the trash can. I highly recommend looking elsewhere for an N64 controller adapter.",2.0

"House of the Dead: Overkill attempts to continue the tradition of SEGA's gory gun games. Typically, players take on the role of a plainclothes agent in an attempt to stop the mega-lo-maniac intentions of a global corporations CEO. But what makes this title the bastard-child in the series is that unlike every other House' title, there was no arcade machine released to build an audience. A small consolation may be that previously featured on the Wii were the `classic' House' games numbers 2 and 3. Released on a single disc with various adjustments, this title had already found a natural home and a somewhat successful reception. Could `Overkill add to the series constructively, or was it an unnecessary addition to the now decade old (or more) canon?

With its speckled and dust-scratched appearance and muddy, warbled audio, `Overkill - in its entirety - is a complete homage to B or even C grade `Grindhouse' films of the seventies and eighties. This has a refreshing and kitsch flavour, and shows that the developer has put some thought into making the title unique where possible. The choice of stylisation gives the game an identity, and artistically it conveys the dirty, underground world of shock cinema well. Obviously, this feature of the game is purely aesthetic, and it's apparent pretty quickly that although the detail is there, it has absolutely no direct effect on the game play itself. In essence, the `Grindhouse' flavour is really just a skin to a horror-themed light-gun game.

The filmic flavour extends to the presentation of the games levels, as each chapter is presented as a possible movie in itself: ""Papa's Palace of Pain"" (clever alliteration and the only `house' level in the game), ""Ballistic Trauma"" (a goofy mix of mutants, firepower and a hospital. Here, the reference to Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is more than subtle). The given scenarios range well, and we're given trains, carnivals, prisons and other video game staples, yet unlike every other entry in the House of the Dead series, the range of enemies in the game is stunningly limited. Mutants (not Zombies, as the game itself stresses through its voice-over dialogue) are overwhelming the most common of enemies. These are represented by a handful of character models and are re-used throughout the entire game. Granted, they are fairly well modelled, but I can't help but think how much more interesting things may have been with some more location-specific mutant creatures.

Game play itself is a mixed experience. Taking out countless mutants is the main task of the game. And how you do this is via a selection of firearms: pistol, shotgun, sub-machine gun etc. The aiming reticule is optional, and re-loading is performed by either the A-button, or by pointing off-screen. The latter method is not as successful as other House of the Dead titles, especially when the motion confuses itself after a compulsory enemy shake-off waggle (unlike Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, an enemy close-encounter is both an annoyance and a guaranteed loss of health).

Unlike other titles in the House of the Dead series, `Overkill asks little of the players' dexterity. Enemy after enemy stagger towards the player from the centre of the screen - while this may be more realistic behaviour, it makes little challenge for the player. Ninety percent of enemies are shot at close-to-mid range, and their behaviours vary little. Occasionally, one or two of them get creative and (gasp!) throw a bottle or knife, but these are easily dismissed with a single shot. In other words, the game has a limited variety of action. I find this baffling, as the game is `on-rails' (no free-movement), and so particular creativity and care is required to hold interest in what could otherwise be classified as a very repetitive game play premise: (aim, shoot, reload ad infinitum). Titles such as Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles and even the House of the Dead release mentioned earlier make efforts to challenge aiming, speed, pattern recognition, timing. `Overkill only grazes past these concepts, rather going for a higher-body count and bigger calibres together. This approach is fine for the short-term, but modern gamers often require more than this.

There's talk of `Overkill having issues with its frame-rate and responsiveness. I want to confirm that these problems certainly do exist. Again, I find this baffling, and can only chalk it up to lack of experience on part of the development team. Of course, it does not ruin the experience, but it certainly undermines it, especially when much simpler and less ambitious titles have perfected frame rate issues. Hell, even a launch title ""Rayman Raving Rabbids"" had smooth and responsive on-rails first-person-shooter sections. I'm not sure what could have caused this stuttering effect that the game suffers from, but it certainly harms the experience.

Musically, the title is both varied and confusing. A lot of effort has gone into providing a soundtrack to the experience, and for the most part it is suitable. Other times, you find yourself distracted, as if the developers wanted you to feel simultaneously frightened and amused - a near impossibility. Killing mutants in grotesque, half-dark environments could be scary, but doing it to an absurd funk song is confusing. It elevates the experience almost to a parody and seems to land the game somewhere between a nerve-wracking scare-fest and a silly shooting gallery mini-game. Audio effects are good for the most part, with loud shot-gun blasts and mutant screams. Strangely, the voice-overs from the two protagonists are mixed unevenly. Washington (the detective based lazily on characters such as Shaft and Jules Winnfield) spouts his garbage loudly and clearly, whereas Agent G's conversed rational and sensible comments are often mixed under the music, resulting in a poor, mumbled reproduction. On another note, it is never explained why these two are put together, and even more ludicrously, it is never shown or explained which of these two men you play as! I find particularly irritating for some reason.

I could go on about the games goofy monetary and reward system, it's depressingly easy level bosses, and it's amazingly shallow mini-game set, but I don't think it's that necessary. For those looking for a major body harvest, this is the game for you. Just be warned that the kills are inversely proportion to the games variety and replay ability.",2.0

"Boy, I have never experienced so much frustration in a racing game in my entire life.  Need for Speed: Rivals should have been titled ""Need for Speed: Cop Escape Simulator.""  You will spend 99% of your time in this game trying to escape the police.  Of course, it's damned near impossible and they will eventually bust you and you will lose every single last speed point you've spent the previous 15 minutes earning.

I have never been more pissed off in a game in my life.

Need to run a race for your speedlist? Well, have fun just trying to make it to the starting line.  You will have to go through 3-4 police chases just to make it to the starting line, assuming they don't bust you and force you to start over.  Fun!

In the event you actually start a race (even if it's not a Hot Pursuit race), you will run across cops you who start a police chase.  Think the police chase is over when you somehow manage to cross the finish line without being destroyed?  Nope! You will spend another 10 minutes trying to escape the police. Of course they'll eventually hunt you down, bust you, and you will lose all your speed points. Again.  Adios, speed points!  Nice to have you had you for a few minutes.

Say, need to complete a time trial?  Sounds great.  Generally with time trials you have to stay on the designated path in order to hit the checkpoint.  Well, I hope you don't run into a cop (you will ALWAYS run into a cop) because now you not only have to focus on the road and the timeclock, but now you have to worry about roadblocks, EMPs, helicopters and everything else.  Have fun with that

And don't think you can get 1/2 mile ahead of a cop, take short cut and hide in a tunnel.  The WILL find you.  Their powers of precognition are without equal.

Do you feel like sinking into the map? Good!  This is the place for you!  I sunk so far into the map that all I could see was the roof of my car.  Amazing!

This game is not fun.  Video games first and foremost should be fun.  This game is maddening.  I never feel like I have a chance.

"I was expecting more from this product after reading dozens of reviews on the quality you get in fps games.
I was sadly mistaken, this headset sounds awful.
VERY awful if you enjoy listening to music or pretty much anything other than games.

There is 0 bass whatsoever in this headset no matter how much you play with the drivers EQ it will not put out bass.
Sort of sounds like ipod earbuds but larger.

Their claims about positional sound with this headset all derive from the simple fact that high frequencies emit a clearer direction than lower frequencies. This modification can be done to any headset that gives you 10 band EQ adjustment. just up your treble and lower your bass and mids, now you've got better positional audio for gaming.
I hear the siberia v2 usb has decent bass, so I'd go for that set before purchasing the 5hv2 usb.

"I absolutely love the Spyro games. That being said, one of my favorite things about the original Playstation Spyro games was the ability to have a little free roaming ability. I loved chasing the sheep and getting the little dragon into trouble. This game doesn't give you that option. You can't go too far out of bounds or it just resets you to where you are ""supposed"" to be. I was finishing this game at a ridiculous rate without even having to try. The controls are not complicated and fun like the old games. In my opinion, this one isn't worth the money or the time.",2.0

"I have loved Call of Duty for over a decade now and own every game since COD4:MW. This game is the first that has severely let me down. I gave Ghosts a 3/5 last year for feeling Blah, but that game really felt like Call of Duty and I got 14 days (in hours) of playing time out of it. Im 40 hours into Advanced Warfare (plus probably another 8 hours for the campaign), and might just be done with it. The game just isn't fun, and usually is just frustrating. I cant get into a good game where I can just play random people, as this game matches you based on skill and I have a 2.0 kd, it always puts me against a clan or into a game where my team is already getting destroyed, and all the details in this game just feel wrong. I also hat the exo, the maps, and none of the guns are fun to use.

Im giving Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare a 2 out of 5. It has good graphics, and the campaign was okay, but the new Exo Suit wrecks multiplayer, and a lot of details in this game are lacking. I look forward to seeing what Treyarch is working on, but am likely done buying anything with the words Advanced Warfare or Sledgehammer written on it.",2.0

"I was looking forward to playing this game as I have loved the first MOH title.  I was extremely disappointed however, when I started playing this game.  I don't know whether it was the piss-poor manual that didn't even explain controls like ""jump"" and ""removing the rifle grenade"".  I ended up accidently finding out how to jump in the 5th mission.  Not one place in the manual did it tell you that ""Y"" is the jump button.  Who did the editing in the manual???

I also didn't like the iron sights on the weapons.  My guns jumped around too much and I wasn't able to get an accurate shot at long range.  The sniper rifle (which I loved in the previous titles) is unforgiving and if you do anything less than a head shot, be prepared to have to shoot your enemy again.

When you die, the game makes you re-jump out of the airplane again.  If you've destroyed any objectives up to that point, they are still destroyed except the game re-spawns ALL the bad guys you fought and killed before.  That was stupid.  This game could have taken a lesson from Battlefield: Bad Company and made sure the enemies were dead, too.

Finding objectives with the compass was a pain in the rear!  The compass helps only a little bit and when you do destroy an objective, you have to do CONSTANT backtracking until you find a way to reach the next one.  That was more annoying than anything.

Buy at your own risk.  The game does have good graphics and the ability to upgrade your weapons is nice, but all in all, if you are looking for a great WWII shooter, just stick with Call of Duty 2 and World at War.",2.0
"In addition to what everyone else has said about having to put quarters or something similiar in the post mount holes, the screw heads that hold the bar are too small and pulled through the plastic on mine.

"Despite the fantastic graphics and my initial excitement and enjoyment when I first started playing, I soon found this game to be mostly annoying. The fact that you automatically ""reload"" every few seconds in a fire fight despite having 300 rounds of ammo on your gun display (and when have you ever seen anyone ever have to reload in a Star Wars movie anyway), gets tedious very quickly. I was also bothered by my team's ghost images showing all the different positions they could take in a fire fight (sniper postion, cover for grenades, etc), and just the fact that you had to waste time actually tageting those positions to give the command, instead of using that time to target the enemies wailing on you. Finally, the enemies themselves were a little too powerful, especially for the numbers they swarm you in. I constantly ran out of ammo (from full load) trying to take down a single super battle droid or Genosian elite. I'm sorry, but when I am constantly finding myself down to my single shot pistol while surrended by numerous enemies (and very few areas where new ammo can be obtained), so that I constantantly need to reload from dying so much, that ceases to be challenging and just becomes annoying.",2.0

"I'm am not a golfer, however, my family and I LOVE the golf mini-game in Wii Sports. So to get a greater fix I purchased this game. Unfortunately this game is not nearly as fun as the Wii Sports version.

Aside from the lame story (which I can forgive), the control scheme feels very much like they slapped the Wiimotes abilities on top of a ""button masher"". For example, in Wii Sports Golf the power of your swing is determined by the force of your swing, in SSG you sloooooowly rock your arm back and press a button to ""set"" the power. This takes a HUGE element of fun out of the game in my opinion. This game might be fun on a traditional console but a Wii game it is not.

I plan on trading this one in, save your money for a future golf game that more closely mimics Wii Sports natural flow.",2.0
"This game has a special spot in the shoebox of shamefully boring games. This game was So much fun for the first 2 hours. Then we are put through the most repetitive gameplay i have EVER been through. LITERAL the same missions are giving to you over and over again. It takes forever to get from one stop to another, but only 6 minute to complete the missions. 50 percent of your time is spent driving, fighting enemy patrol cars, fighting enemy outpost(the enemies re spawn the minute you leave the location). The machete is useless, there is no character development, the story is weak at best, there are very few weapons.

On a bright side we get amazing graphics for its time, the ability to burn down fields of grass as a means of distraction, realistic gun and jamming sequences, and other small aspects that in no way shape or form make up for the negative aspects.

I had high hopes during the first hour of two but this is one game i will never play again.",2.0

"Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is a game in flames!

 The bugs on the 360 version are too numerous to list, it's ridiculous to pay $60 to beta test products for companies. Thus far, I've encountered countless lockups, corrupted saves, clipping issues with video and enemies disappearing into rocks trees and buildings while still being able to shoot at you, endless loops for resources that you pickup (just leave and come back and viola it's respawned), invisible boats, buildings appearing and disappearing, flashing ""police car"" lights at random places, inability to shop at merchants, inability to pickup or even use resources like C4 and grenades, stop outside a building you can enter with a vehicle that is trashed and enter/exit the building and viola your vehicle is 100%, buy a vehicle/copter  at the villa save your game after and return to find the vehicle is MIA but you still paid for it. These are just the bugs I can think of off the top of my head!

 The story line seems pointless, exact revenge on someone that didn't pay you and shot you in the butt. Missions lack variety and are basically the same, with few exceptions, for each faction. Pickup, dead or alive, X number of ""high value targets"" and blow up X number of buildings and take over designated areas to establish bases, rince and repeat. Many of the glitches will prevent or limit completion of the missions as well. Enemy AI is very poor. In many instances you can walk right up, undisguised, to an enemy without being attacked. When bored with the missions, one can accept ""challenges"" from the support crew that are made up of silly timed races involving shooting, driving, or moving objects with a helicopter.

Graphically, in HD, the game isn't even last gen never mind next gen.

 If you haven't played the first Mercenaries buy that or any of the other vastly superior sandbox games available before spending your hard earned cash on this. Wait for Merc's 2 to hit the bargain bin, maybe there will be enough patches and updates by then it will actually be a finished product.",2.0

"I liked the dragon characters.  Some of the character design work was decent.  Storyline was somewhat interesting, but after playing through the first branch of the story, I didn't find the overall experience satisfying enough to plug through the game again in the hopes of something changing.  I liked collecting and upgrading the weapons.

The graphics were poor.  The camera controls were not sharp.  The stage designs were very linear.  The game play is fun for a bit, but the weapon swapping system isn't really deep or rewarding enough to carry all the way to the end.  Most of the characters were one-dimensional; they attempted to make them interesting only by extrapolating their niche into the absurd.  The variety of monsters were not interesting.  The post-apocalyptic world only holds your interest for the briefest periods of time.  The humor occasionally amuses, but it feels desperate and forced at other times.

There is a pretty long list of other games that I would recommend ahead of this one.  The Souls series, Dragon's Dogma, Dragon's Crown, Nier... even Reckoning: Kingdoms of Amalur or Dynasty Warriors 8.",2.0

VF4: Evolution does not have a single bit of my recommendation.",2.0
"Bought this on a whim to fill the racing game whole in my heart, but was quick to learn this wasn't the racing game I was looking for. Still retains the 'acrade'-y feel Need for Speed always had.

Gameplay wise you can take on the role of bad racer vs. good cop which essentially boils down to driving faster than cops or driving faster than the bad guys. There are a few unique twists for each side but nothing to write home about. There are plenty of car choices, but they're all 'speed' cars, you won't find unique brands here. GM cars and italian studs aplenty.

You'll want a gamepad for this as well, keyboard controls blow for racing games in general and especially for a twitchy Need for Speed title.

Visually the game is impressive, there is a good amount of blur when speeding, and the scenery in the distance looks great. But there isn't alot of detail for nearby set pieces. You'll often find yourself starting at a lot of orange colors, which can be a tad overwhelming, but better than your standard gray affair you see too much these days.

Technically the game supports triple monitor gaming which I appreciate, and EA games generally seem to offer, which again I applaud for EA. You will need to create a 'Need for Speed' account using an email and password which I dislike.",2.0

"UPDATED: with new info and spelling error fixes. 1 final update to come later today.

Intro:

First of all, im going to say the only reason im reviewing this card this soon at all is because Amazon.com was nice enough to offer a promotion that if those who bought the wifi version PSVita between the 20th to the 25th of feb/12 you get a free PSVita 4GB Memory Card with your new device thanks Amazon.com if it weren't for you guys i woulda avoided the PSVita altogether until the prices became decent. It's a deal i couldn't resist as there's no way in hell i would ever pay $20 for a 4GB card for anything, so it will remain the only card i own until the inevitable price drop for some or all cards eventually happen.

Note: Im not a sony fanboy, i used to be back when i was like 17 years old in 2007 but lets be honest here.. thats when most sony fanboys were truly born soo yeah lol, im 21 now and matured out of the horrible sony phase and am incredibly fair, this review is to benefit the customer ""US GAMERS"" not loyal lunatics. i've owned every playstation gaming console/device from PS1 to officially now the PSVita so i do know some things i'd like to think.

Quality:

It looks to be a quality product as usual for Sony, but the fact that it's a new Proprietary Format made just for the PSVita is a major mistake on Sony's part, there really screwing over there customers by doing this. for example i have had a PSP Slim 2000 first edition and own currently a PSP 3000 MGS spirited green Edition, both with many Memory Stick Pro Duo Memory ranging from 256MB all the way up to 12GB spanning across 5-6 well priced sticks altogether. 2 of which still have a lot of space that i COULD have used for my PSVita, if it weren't for this exclusive format, costing us the customers/gamers ultimately more money out of pocket in the long run.

Sure the actual quality of the card is great, but it's not the card's quality thats in question, it's the motives behind such a choice thats extremely irritating.

Straight to the point now. would i recommend getting the 4GB or any of the overpriced PSVita memory cards? well i tell you what, if you want to play the games from the shockingly awesome launch line-up for the Vita within it's first week, then yes get the 4GB since you'll need at least 1 card to save your stuff to, other then that though AVOID buying all memory cards until they eventually reduce the price on some of the higher storage cards, its simply not worth the cash. you would be saving money simply by buying the games in stores or online like right here on amazon.com since for example my first PSVita game BlazBlue: Continuum Shift EXTEND is only 2048KB to save 1 file, going by that you'll have a lot of space to work with for more games and apps by conserving if you buy the games in stores/amazon.com in physical format rather then digital. besides as gamers collecting and looking at all the cases you bought is still pretty sweet once they start stacking up.

Space: The free card that came with the Wifi version was the 4GB Card, it's decent considering game saves will only be around 2048KB to maybe 9000KB-ish so it'll last you well in game saves if you buy the format in physical form rather then saving $5 by downloading them from PSN.

however let's be honest in general 4B is simply not enough in general, it's a good start and that's all, nothing more nothing less.

Design: It's very, very small. i was actually shocked at how tiny the card was, its more like a memory chip then a card, it's sleek looking with a decent looking design but who really cares when it'll be jammed in your PSVita for the most part anyway? still the size of the thing is rather shocking, it's the smallest memory card i've ever seen. BE CAREFUL, because it can get lost easily.

Transfer Speed/Download Speed/Upload Speed: I have not tested this yet as i have not put it in my PSVita to download anything off of the PlayStation Network since the actual memory card that came with it free along with 1 game i bought came earlier then the PSVita itself. once my device does arrive though i'll update this, im going to assume it's fast though in all 3 in spades.

Overall: In general, if your a gamer you need this plain and simple, it's very expensive all of the cards are but to start things off the 4GB is the only real choice if you wanna save your monnies. my advice, wait it out for the bigger storage cards to drop in price OR wait til' someone like Sandisk make there own cheaper 3rd party versions, which they usually do at half the cost with the same if not better quality.",2.0

"I want to try and be careful in my review here.  I'm thirty and I didn't like  this very much.  The problem is that TMNT was CLEARLY made for someone who is a lot younger then I am.  It feels wrong somehow to be ripping a game that the developer (Ubisoft) never really intended for me to play anyway.  It has the same vibe as if I was whining that I couldn't ride around on my nephew's power-wheels quad.  I did want to, at least, point out a few issues that I'd had though.

First, the graphics are somewhere around a pretty good PS2 game.  This is not something that you're going to use to show off a next-gen system at all.  It feels like (and probably was) it was ported over from an older console.  I don't think it hits the point of being flat-out ugly, but not the least bit impressive either.

The game-play, I thought, was awful.  It's criminal that one of the central themes of any turtles game since the original NES console was teamwork and yet we get no co-op or online multi-player?  This feature alone would have been enough for me to make a purchase.  The fact that it wasn't included is wildly disappointing and a total let-down.

The enemy A.I. is below average.  None of the enemies I fought were particularly difficult and generally tended to stay in one place and not put up too much of a fight while I whaled away at them.  Again though, this was intended for someone much younger; giving the benefit of the doubt, someone under ten might find this a bit more challenging then I did.  It's also virtually impossible to die.  If your health runs out or if you fall off a ledge you respawn right where you left off.  The game is over, basically, whenever you decide to stop playing.

The game is terribly short.  If you're motivated, you could finish this in four or five hours.  I, again, feel the need to point out that this was intended for a much younger player.  Maybe it would take them a while longer.  For me though, chalk this up as a 'rental only.' It's an easy 1000 achievement points, but it's doomed to leave anyone over ten ultimately unfulfilled and not worth anywhere near fifty bucks for a new copy.  Grab an xBox marketplace card and download the 1989 coin-op version of TMNT instead, it may be a little older but you'll have twice as much fun at about a quarter of the cost.",2.0

"I am a big Sims 2 Fan and when I added the ""Kitchens and Bathrooms Interior Design Stuff"" Pack to my game, it really didn't do that much for the game play over all. Like all ""Stuff"" packs, they just add new stuff to give you more items for your kitchens and bathrooms. Would I recommend the item for other Sims2 fams? Yes, but with most stuff packs I found out there are a few bonus items used as insentive ""not"" included that should be. For example like most packs there maybe an item missing and special codes to obtain to get the items. When I was looking for bonus items eariler I came accross many items that I never realized were offered with each expansion or stuff pack as bonus offers. With the purchase of the pack you should get a code to unlock the item or items. I ordered the Kitchens & Bathrooms Interior Stuff Pack and never got a bonus code to give me a poster or a toilet paper holder or even some neat clothing.

"I am a huge adventure game fan, I did Schizm and enjoyed it. I have played all the versions of MYST, and others with a simmilar game play style, as they are my forte, and most enjoyable to me.  I usually can finish a game with little or no help, and maybe at times, a hint, to get out of a bind, but this game seemed to have little or no logic, and having had to refer to a walkthrough for MOST of it, I found it frustrating, tedious and annoying.  Some of the bizzare sounds in it literally made me nauseous and I had to mute the game to get through those parts! I found that even with the walkthrough, I asked myself repeatedly, how was I supposed to figure THAT out!?
The graphics are indeed awesome, or I would not have even bothered to take the time to see it through to the end. It made me tense and was really not worth my time.  I frankly would only recommend this game to someone who is a dedicated gamer, and who wants a challenge that could cause you to want to pull out your hair!!

"Microsoft shouldn't be allowed to advertise their systems as a 500 GB & 1 TB console. When in fact, the 500 GB is only 320 of usable space and the 1 TB is only 720 GB.

As CNET described the One console, when it first came out, ""it's a great entertainment console but sucks for playing games"". That's dead on accurate. Loading time for games is very disappointing. The game list is pretty pathetic, that includes the backwards compatibility list. If you're going to purchase this console, buy the ""500"" GB and purchase a 4 TB (3.0 USB) external hard drive.

I realized you have to do the same objectives (with different bosses)over and over again. Don't get me wrong, the bosses were epic but to get through one circle (stage) to the other circle and to defeat the bosses was very repetitive. Furthermore, I felt the story was lacking substance, because it talks about his seven sins with a brief cinematic scene...that's all. Also, the way you collect a Judas coin, a relic or any other other object you do it in the same fashion: pull out your cross and hit circle several times.

Then as soon as I cross the blue line to try for the win, freezes, nothing you can do but quit the game.  EA should be ashamed of themselves for releasing games with these problems, but instead they laugh all the way to the bank because there is no competition and suckers like me buy their crap.

I was expecting the worst after reading some of the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this EA sports title.  Surprised because EA is possibly the laziest and worst sports game franchise out there, and they created the abomination that is Madden 12.  Anyway, this game is really pretty good, the commentary is fluid, as is gameplay.  The controls are pretty good (you use the analog sticks for everything, which is great for a hockey game).  The only problems are a few minor flaws which, considering this is an EA title, are not horrible.
The first thing I was excited about is custom music, yes, you can play your own music from the ps3 during menus and Be A Pro Goals, however I find that after a game, the menu music stops and you surf the menu in silence (which is ok, because the music on this game sucks, seriously, they have Mony Mony by Billy Idol???)  The second problem is the menu interface, which is just as sloppy and annoying as that of the worst sports game of all time, Madden 12.  Gameplay is great however, it makes me wonder if EA did some headhunting of 2k sports programmers for this one.  You cannot just march down the ice single handedly and score, you have to cycle the puck and take shots from open spaces, preferably from the slot to score.  Unlike Madden 12, the worst sports game in the history of the PS3, this game is realistic, fun, and not just sloppy predictable play wrapping up screenshots.  If you like hockey, this is a must.",2.0

"I pre-orderd this game for me and my friends we were very upset the online play wasn't at all what we were expecting
we wanted a break from Blackops.

CONS-poor graphics,you only get 1 secondary hand gun, the maps are too huge take forever to get across the map n then die and do it again.time is a factor in this game once time runs out thats it! the clock needs to be longer cuz it take time to get BattlePoints so you can use a tank or jeep or chopper.

"So this game by itself would be fine.  However, it's a remake of the original Nintendo version and as that it's really missed the mark.  Many characters are the same in this and the old version, but they've tweaked things.  They added another special move, which is actually welcome to me.  What is most unwelcome is the fact that they changed the timing of when you should duck/block/punch.  They changed it just enough that getting better at this game would make me worse at the original (yes I still have and play).  So while I can easily get to Tyson on the original, I can barely make it past the second circuit on this, which is a shame because I love the improved graphics.",2.0
"It looks like the Guitar Hero series is going the way of Rock Band -- instead of trying to find songs that might actually be *fun* to play in a rhythm guitar game, they've crammed it full of big-name hits that are totally boring and monotonous to  plod through. Whoever thought 'No Sleep Til Brooklyn' would be a good song to include should probably have their head examined.

A lot of the songs just have you rhythmically strumming on the same note/chord repeatedly (*cough* Eye Of The Tiger *cough*) and if you were even a reasonably skilled Guitar Hero 3 player, you will sleepwalk through most of this title. It does have some Tool and Dream Theater, but out of the 80+ songs that are available, there's maybe 10 of them that I'd actually want to play more than once.

My recommendation? Try Rock Band 2. If you're going to play a bunch of songs that suck, you should at least have more of them to choose from.",2.0
"i haven't played this game much yet (i guess that says it all), but here's my impression so far.  this game is advertised for its great multiplayer, yet i had no such experience.  for one thing, the maps are pretty bad.  they're really small and the whole game simply feels like counterstrike with star wars graphics.  sure, the graphics are really good, but what about the gameplay?  well, at times it's fun, but here's my biggest complaint - WHO ARE THE ENEMIES?  for god's sake, would it kill them to make it easier to see who's on your team and who's on the other team??  in a game like call of duty, each side has different uniforms so it's obvious.  to make it even worse, servers use friendly fire.  so i'm running around just trying to figure out who to shoot.  some of the weapons are quite cool, but i had some problems.  would it kill them to put in a description in the game of what weapons do what?  i used the incinerator on people and nothing happens.  and what all can those tongs be used for?  what's going on?!  granted i should probably read the instruction manual, but if i wanted to read, i'd read a book.

as far as the space fighting, the graphics are great, but the gameplay was TERRIBLE.  i couldn't figure out how to find the enemies in the vastness of space, how to shoot them or anything.  i think this kind of thing should be somewhat intuitive.  i don't play flight sims or anything, but i can easily figure out how to fly a plane... if you make it intuitive.

on the plus side, the single player is good so far.  i'm curious as to whether battlefront 1 is a better multiplayer game than this, but i'm not sure i want to spend the money to find out.",2.0

"Graphics are fine, no issues. Same with stereo sound. The execution is a bit odd though, which is my big gripe.

There is a scene where the heroes need to get back to the back ship, in a little boat. It takes a long, long, long time. This is what I politely call ""filler"". All you can do is hold down the 'move' button for what 5 minutes? 10 minutes? What a waste of time.

There is a scene where the main battleship is taken over by the enemy. The heroes eventually rescue the Captain, who is hiding in a closet. What a brave Captain that is - his men being slaughtered and he hides in a storage room! Captain Garrison is a coward.

The main protagonist is called Recker. He ain't allowed to talk. I guess he can't talk, I dunno - there is no explanation for this phenomenon. He kills all the bad guys in Campaign mode. His 2 partners fire away, but can't hit the side of a barn from the inside. Recker must kill them or they kill him. Likewise, his partners are never hurt. They just stand there like store dummies while Recker does the work. Very odd game design.

Perhaps the game is better played online. I've had so many issues with online gaming, I've given up. I have a 100mbps wifi connection, so that isn't the problem. Oh, in case you are wondering how you know you've 'killed' a bad guy, they scream when you do. Wounded, they are quiet, but they all have time to scream when you blow them to bits.

Another really bad plot line. Captain Garrison is told to steam toward port. He tells the radioman to use Morse Code to signal his intentions. The radioman says ""There isn't time"". To send a morse code signal? It takes minutes at most! These writers must have been trained in their parent's basement in battle tactics. The game is a few years old now, so you can get it for peanuts. I'd buy it just to kill a bit of time with. But don't expect a lot more than great graphics and sound. The story sucks.",2.0

"The battles look great when you zoom in, but you really can't fight that way because you miss too much, like more enemies joining the fight.  You basically spend all your time fighting off pirate attacks (when in history have pirates ever messed with fleets of warships?).  There are three different factions you can play, but the differences in ships are pretty minor and they play about the same.  If there is a ""tactical"" aspect of fighting these ships, I missed it - seems like you just get them close and watch them slug it out.

The ""real time strategy"" thing is not really a positive thing in my mind.  You end up scurrying around trying to sneak in the research and building in between more pirate attacks.  Just makes the game feel more harried.  After a week or so, I stopped playing this - I would not recommend it.

I recommend ""Star Wars - Empire at War"" instead - similar kind of game, but more more fun.",2.0
"The good about ff14 is the graphics. It is simply beautiful. I purchased the downloaded version of this game. Installing took about 5 hours including upgrades. Getting setup with a id name and password went smooth and I was ready to play. Creating a character was somewhat tedious, for only the gladiator looked human. You start the game with a quest giver and go out to fill that quest and return to get your reward, which is peanuts money wise.

The BIG problem in the game is SOUND, except for the music. There are NO VOICE OVERS from any of the quest givers and no animal grunts, moans, and yelpings from any beasts you slain either. All the conversation from Quest givers is IN TEXT with no sound and you must constantly click on it to find out your objective. It is like watching a silent movie with no voices being heard at all. This really irked me. Also trying to figure out the map symbols is hard as well. The symbols are small on the map to read.

The chat text is difficult to read and is set at about a font size of 6 and if you wear glasses, LOL. Lastly there is no in game manual. Maybe with the console version one came with it, but with the PC download version none is supplied. I realize ff14 just came out and perhaps the programmers will fix these issues. But I doubt they will fix the main issue of no voice overs. So, in the meantime I will stick with World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 for the console. Happy gaming!",2.0

"Zombies seem to be everywhere. Comics, television, and especially video games. Zombie games have to do a lot to stand out in the crowd now. Dead Island taunted a gorgeous open world and deep RPG driven gameplay, but did it deliver what it promised?

The moment you first lay eyes on the island resort of Banoi, you're most likely going to say something along the lines of ""Wow, this game is beautiful!"" and you'd be right. Everything in Dead Island is very well rendered, from the good to the bad. The palm trees and sand are pleasing to the eyes, and in the same way gashed and chewed up remains are absolutely disgusting. If there is one good thing I have to say about Dead Island it is that the graphics are consistently stunning.

Upon booting up the game, you are presented the choice of 4 different characters. Each character has different specialties and personalities, but unfortunately none of them are likable. All of the playable characters are an annoying stereotype, from the football jock to the coky feminist , and they just had to throw in a gangster black guy to boot. Add on top of that that none of them had any reason to vacation to the island aside from getting drunk and partying and you just don't really care if they survive or not.

The game controls from the first person perspective and is for the most part an RPG. You take on quests from other island survivors and, as you complete more story related quests new areas are opened to you. One area where the game falls short is that it is not nearly as open as it claims to be. Once you unlock all the areas, it is decently large but the island is still not that big. In the end, you're pretty much made to stay in the area where the story is unfolding unless you want to be completely bored to death. Killing zombies and completing quests awards you with experience, and as you level up you acquire skill points to buy upgrades and abilities with.

Another area the game falls short is the weapons. The game was supposed to be about improvising and using what is around you, but instead there are only a handful of items that can be used as weapons. Fortunately these weapons can be upgraded to break the monotony, but that still isn't enough. For example, if you have a baseball bat and 2 nails, you make a spiked bat. This is cool, but doesn't save the game from the fact that there are very few weapons. As you use weapons, they degrade. Guns become less accurate and strong, and pipes bend and rust. Use them enough and the weapon will break. This is kind of a neat feature, but ultimately the fact that you will likely find another weapon just like it soon causes you to only care so much. On top of that, combat eventually just gets repetitive and boring to the point that you hope you don't tun into another enemy - and not because you're dying.

Overall, Dead Island is very pretty, but that does not save it from mediocre gameplay that doesn't live up to any of its promises. Perhaps if I had known nothing about the game prior to my purchase, I would have enjoyed it more. I watched all the prerelease trailers and read most of the articles about it before it came out. I expected a wonderful, beautiful, open world zombie game. It may have delivered on the beautiful part, but the gameplay is fairly linear despite the side quests and the combat gets old quickly. There are plenty of toher zombie games out there that are much more worthy of your money and your time.",2.0

"I bought this to replace my wireless logitech headset, which is starting to show it's age.

I had high hopes with this item but it was bad in a lot of ways that surprised me.  Maybe I got a dud, but either way it failed my needs.

Cons: The ear piece doesn't fit in your ear it rests outside your ear so it's difficult to hear people.  It sits awkwardly because of the very basic ear hook.  It's uncomfortable.  The connection was intermittent, it would inexplicably connect sometimes and other times it wouldn't regardless of how I tried to fix it.  Then the next day magically working again.  When it did connect my friends would only hear every other word, I don't know if this was a very strong noise cancellation feature or a defect.

Pros: Charges fast, has a stand and many buttons to use the available features.  It claimed to be able to fast switch between a phone and the PS3, a feature I wanted to use but never did because of the issues I had with this product.

I played this on a DSI XL, I can't imagine how hard it must be to find objects using the tiny regular DS screen.  The ending was aweful and restarted the game from square one.  I read a review here where someone was playing through it 3-4 times to get all the scrolls, this game has no replay value since it is heavily text based.  I really cannot believe a simple game like this was brought to market at such a high price.

"The game itself is pretty fun.  It's mostly a series of timed target and critter shooting with increasing levels of difficulty (at least as much as I've explored so far).  If you like shooters that are more cartoonish, this one is pretty decent.

The drawback, however, is the game controller attachment - the thing you connect your controller and nunchuk to so you can more easily do the actual shooting and maneuvering.  In short, it's really awful.  In order to use it properly, one must put the left hand on the back to maneuver, the right hand on the front and aim pretty much like a dweeb who has never shot any kind of firearm.  Movement is awkward while firing and firing is extremely inaccurate while moving.  The best thing to do is to try to use the controller as a pistol (although it fails at that due to the two-handed design and the front-grip on it for shooting instead of the back grip).

To list the controller's drawbacks:
1. The length is too short for a rifle-style shooter.
2. Integrating the nunchuk into the weapon was a stroke of stupidity for any kind of shooter.  As a rifle, the hand placement is backwards.  Even when shooting a pistol, if one does it two handed, the left hand is cupping the right, not six inches behind the right hand. You'll do better in the game if you leave the nunchuk unattached and use it in your free hand.
3. Stand WAY BACK from your television to get any similarity between your aim point on the screen and the place the target gets hit.  (At least 10 feet)
4. If you have the rechargeable battery pack, the Wii controller it has a real hard time fitting into the module.  Try not to force it or it will break.

If this is your only shooter game, you'll tire of it quickly with this attachment for the controller.

I've purchased another shooter controller, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wii-SureShot-Rifle/dp/B001LY0QJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wii SureShot Rifle</a>, and tossed in a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perfect-Shot-for-Wii/dp/B000X2RKOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perfect Shot for Wii</a>&nbsp;just for fun.

"Never thought I'd complain about a video game being too realistic but after watching my son play this after he'd played it enough to become very proficient at it I was taken aback by the realism of the game in the way the soldiers looked and moved and the weapons they used and how exciting it could be to hunt the 'enemy' and gun them down.

The real trouble in my opinion, and why I threw the game away, was because it was very realistic when it came to the chase, battle scenes, and the kill rate, often at point blank range but not when it came to the actual results of combat and the effects of the various, highly effective killing weapons used. There were no soldiers screaming in agony because they were shot in the stomach, or had their legs blown off, or shot in the face or writhing in pain in an open courtyard as they bled out and finally stopped screaming for help. They make the weapons and soldiers realistic but the part of war and battle that sane men, brave men, patriots and soldiers hate, the suffering that goes with it, they conveniently leave out. I understand of course, they're trying to sell games but I don't like that killing is becoming a very realistic ""game"". They've made it so it's not really connected to killing human beings - they're just targets and all of them drop dead quickly, neatly, and quietly - nothing realistic about that at all.",2.0
"So, I wanted to give everyone the knowledge of my experience with this game.

I bought it going in with thoughts of The Umbrella Chronicles and how great of an experience I had with that game. I thought Sweet, I can play through Resident Evil 2 and some of the games that the first one didn't cover. What I quickly learned was that while I did get to experience those Resident Evil games not covered in the first, this was not The Umbrella Chronicles.

The greatest problem I had with this game was the constantly shifting camera. It made it hard to line up shots when the camera was constantly bobbing back and forth slightly as if you were looking through the eyes of someone breathing heavy after a run. Now, I get this is suppose to add realism, but I also bought this because it was a rail shooter not Call of Duty. This urked me and my buddy, who played with me through The Umbrella Chronicles, to the point where he quit wanting to play it and I begrudgingly beat the stupid thing.

"Eh...2 1/2 stars.  I found this CoD to be subpar in both its campaign and multi-player modes.  To be honest I didn't finish the campaign mode...but that was because I found it really boring.  However, I will say I'm not a big fan of most campaign modes anyway.

If you are someone who hates ""camping,"" you will love this game.  If you like to camp, you should definitely skip it.

The multiplayer is relatively disappointing.  The maps make it difficult to impossible for your team to pick a point and hold down the fort.  Some players call this ""camping,"" but those people say that about any tactic they can't beat.  There should be at least a couple maps that are good for people who like to hold a position...or for those who like the challenge of taking a position.  There are too many entry points to each position in this game.  Obviously, Activision was listening the the constant anti-camping chatter you see all over the internet, and they were probably trying to solve that issue, instead they created more problems and took away some of the fun.  It's also WAY too easy to die in this game.

The maps themselves are pretty large - a couple maps are the biggest of any CoD game yet.  You can run across some of these maps and not see a single player.  I love that snipers have their day, so I'm not gonna complain about the sizes of maps, though a few smaller options would be nice.",2.0

"- The analog sticks are worse than a normal Xbox 360 controller. I can't play FPS games on the sensitivity I'm used to with it. The sensitivity switch is a joke. The controller's left analog stick started stuttering inputs after the controller cable detached from the controller. It's weird, it's like the cable for the controller is a PS/2 to USB adapter; something like that. All of the above won't affect most 3rd person action games, but FPS is a nogo.
- Dpad gave me blisters the likes of which I hadn't had since classic NES. Trying to do quarter circle Street Fighter moves will burn you out. Typical Xbox 360 Dpad location in relation to the orientation/angle of how your thumb touches it leads to problems.

+ It's easier to rapid fire press the shoulder and trigger buttons

"16 monsters to fight and a sword that shows you not only how to find them, but where to hit them to kill them.  That's all there is to the game play of this title.  The graphic are stunning in many cases, and the 16 colossus monsters are works of art, but the game play itself is tedious.  You run around the countryside following the directions of your sword to find a colossus, then use the sword to find it's weak spots.  Then you just need to figure out how to climb up on it, which is about the only puzzle of the game.  Once on a monster, you spend most of your time hanging on and using the joystick to tell your character which way you'd like them to move, and then waiting to see if he'll be able to move or if he'll run out of strength from hanging on and fall off instead.  Repeat for the remaining 15 colussi.  The second colossus can't even kill you -- I let the main character stand in the middle of the battlefield for 20 minutes; every minute or so the colossus would stomp me and I'd loose health, but I'd recover it by the time he came around again.

"I have to say as soon as I started playing this, I was also severely disappointed. It is no way near as much fun as the original. As mentioned in another review, the whole point of HP Lego 1-4 was using the stylus to cast all the spells, and in this one, you don't even need the stylus. You can use it to change characters, spells, and during dueling, but it's not necessary since they provide you the keys for use of the use.

The graphics are quite poor, and with the concept of the stylus gone, this game just isn't as fun. The concept is basically the same though, go through every level trying to collect as many studs, do spells to unlock new areas, and collect the hats, red legos, and unlock characters. I guess the only thing I do like more about this one is that the game allows you the option of saving more frequently since each section is broken down into multiple sections. You can also leave some areas by choice, not because the game moves on. This can be helpful if you still want to explore.

Otherwise, this game is a huge disappointment compared to the first, although I don't think it's as poorly done as Pirates of the Caribbean Lego, but probably about second since I have both Indiana Jones and both Star Wars Lego on top of the original Harry Potter one. In the end, if you're a fan of the original, you probably won't like this one as much.",2.0
"Have you played GTA before? If so, this is no different except it's more like GTA 3 than a new GTA because in many ways it's a step backwards. I got this game because I thought it would have something original in it, it does not.  Same old storyline; betrayed, then revenge.  Same guns, same kinds of characters, same kinds of cars, they even copied nola for the city so it's not even like they designed the world the game is set in.  I wonder if the designers and programmers of this game had a single original idea.  If it was at least a step forward in some areas, I wouldn't mind it so much.  The graphics are awful, you can only carry 2 guns and a very limited amount of ammo (carrying 20 guns and thousands of rounds ala GTA is excessive but this is too much, or too little as it were).  Yes they claim it is open world but there is very little you can do or interact with when compared to a lot of other games.  Yes it's very buggy and unstable (problems with mission starts objective placement ect.)  The game gets insanely repetitive after just a few short hours of playing.

"Terrible terrible terrible... very very dissapointed with sony. I actually bought this game for ps2 even tho i had it for the pc. The graphics r terrible, the controls r demented, and it is no fun without playing it with atleast 10 people in the same map with people all over the world, which is a very lacking point of this game.. don't waste your money and time buying this game... get it for the computer... it is cheaper than this one, it's still played, and is a great game... the pc game is a classic, the ps2 one is no more worth a pecan's droppings.",2.0

"Final Fantasy XIII is a beautiful game. the visuals and music are excellent. Thats about all the game has going for it. the story isn't outstanding among the rest of the series, but that is okay with me and not the biggest flaw with the game.

The game leads you from Point A to Point B on a narrow path with nice (but unreachable) scenery, much like some first person shooters. the small map sizes are a step backwards from the large branching maps of Final Fantasy XII. Can you believe that the 8-bit Zelda has more exploration than FFXIII? Its true.

Battle system is excellent. Its the best turn-based menu driven battle system in the genre. If you love battling, you will love this game, as thats all there is to do, even the side quests are battles but with tougher enemies. There isn't any variety at all to the gameplay. Fight, run down the road a little, fight, run down the road a little more, boss fight, cutscene, run down that LONG road more, repeat.

With modern day RPGs offering so much variety and exploration as well as compelling stories, its disappointing FFXIII hasn't offered a comparable experience. It would have been an EXCELLENT game last generation on PS2, but the series needs to get with the times.",2.0

(This is a review that I originally wrote on 08/18/2002)
--------------------------------------------------

I bought this game because I like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-In-Black/dp/B0000640SB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men In Black</a>&nbsp;and I figured that it would be a good game. I couldn't be any more wrong.

Gameplay

The whole premise of the game is this: you go from room to room (or area to area) and kill everything that moves (except for the ""worm dudes"" whom you're supposed to rescue ... or something like that).

There are five big levels broken up into sections, which too many semi-long load screen in between.

Considering that all you do in the game is shoot things, I really wonder why the programmers didn't give the player an Aim button. Then again, they didn't give a Jump button, either (jumping surely would have broken up the monotony of the game).

The most fun I had in the game was destroying all the cars on the parking garage levels. You don't get any points for it, and it doesn't accomplish a goal, but it sure was fun!

Story

An alien prison ship crash lands on Earth, the bad aliens escape, and you have to kill them. That's all the plot there is and it's probably all you'll need.

I've seen the first film, but I've never seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MIB2/dp/B00005JKZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MIB2</a>. However, from what I know about it, the plot of this game is nothing like it. Rather than calling it ""Men in Black 2: Alien Escape,"" Infogrames should have just called it ""Men in Black: Alien Escape."" That way no one would think it was even remotely like the recent film.

The only aspect of the game that, I think, is like the film (assuming I was able to deduce enough of the film's plot correctly from the trailers) is a small bit of the ending involving the Statue of Liberty and a Neurolizer.

Audio/Video

In all honesty, I didn't pay too much attention to the audio, except for the voice actors. They were pretty good, but let's face it, Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Rip Torn are the guys we know as Agents K, J, and Zed respectively, and no one is going to be able to play those roles better. They tried to model the characters and hire voices that resemble Tommy, Will, and Rip, but unless they hired the actual actors and got permission to use their likenesses, it's always going to look like a cheap imitation ... which it does.

The weapon graphics were a little flashy, but considering the MIB's arsenal, I expected more flash from the weapons (and where's the Noisy Cricket, by the way?).

The environments were the WORST! They all look bland, muddy, washed-out, and extremely repetitive (especially on the spaceship at the end where every corridor looks just like the last).

Replayability

To make up for the short and boring game, Infogrames threw in a bunch of unlockables to make you want to play the game again. Unfortunately, they're simply not worth unlocking. I used a cheat code to unlock everything and here's what you'd get: a couple training missions of you in one room shooting an endless supply of aliens (shouldn't these be available from the start as TRAINING for the main game?), profiles of J and K, Boss mode (fight the bosses again), profiles of all the aliens in the game (all of whom are boring and not in the films, except for the manitoba [worm guys]), and a bunch of still frames detailing the making of the game (not the movie). Yawn.

I have tried to charge them via usb connected to the xbox one, generic wall charger, and laptop to no avail. No matter how long I hold the power button down they will not turn on (and the red light showing that they were charging was on, it is no longer on as they are supposed to be fully charged.  Any help or advice would be appreciated (waiting to hear back from TB support).

So while they worked

Setup
I had these up and running in about 10 minutes. The transmitter connects via usb AND optical cable. I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ViewHD-SPDIF-TOSLINK-Digital-Optical-Audio-Switcher-3x1-with-Remote-Three-Inputs-to-One-Output/dp/B00G188Z7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ViewHD SPDIF | TOSLINK Digital Optical Audio Switcher 3x1 with Remote (Three Inputs to One Output)</a>&nbsp;so that I could have my soundbar and headset transmitter connected at the same time. Works great. There is only one audio optical out on the xbox one so you will  need something like this if you have multiple audio devices with optical usage.
The headset paired very easily and sound was working very quickly.
I updated the firmware later on and it took another 15 minutes as you have to download a TB program and then update them.

Wireless?
Absolutely wireless-yes! No connection to controller or console needed.

Comfortable?
I have worn these for about 3-4 hours straight without any discomfort. They are comfortable by my standards.

Sound
I am not an audiophile but I have owned other TB's in the past, and these have the best sound quality I have experienced in headset. Gunshots and explosions in COD AW sound great. I have never owned any other brand so I can't really compare to astros ect.
Now as others have said these don't get CRAZY loud. I probably have them at 75% loudness and it is very crisp and a good volume for me. If I put them all the way up it is too loud for me but honestly I expected them to get louder. I'll put it this way, it is too loud for me but it doesn't hurt my ears.
The presets work well as you can definitely tell the difference when surround is on and when it is not. There is gaming mode (with four different settings like shooter, sports, racing), movie mode (with horror, action, drama), and music (with dance, acoustic, stadium), and SS off.

Charge
I probably played 10-15 hours for the first drain. FYI they beeped twice letting me know that the battery was drained. THere is no capability to use batteries or a charging pack (which would have been nice).

Mic
So I wasn't exactly thrilled with the mic either. It has three settings for sensitivity on the headset. I found myself having to talk pretty loudly for it to pick up my voice even on the most sensitive setting and it didn't work on the least sensitive. It is nice that the mic pics up your voice and then you can hear it through the headset.
The mic does plug in or out so you don't have to walk around with a mic if you don't want too.

Noise cancellation
So I could hear outside noise with these on which is fine by me. I am sure if you had it on the loudest setting though, you would not hear much outside noise.

Different uses
You can use these for PC (mic doesnt work). I have not tried other uses yet but it does have headphone output as well.

So if these had continue to work I would give them 4.5 stars. Sound is very good, could be louder. Mic is a little finicky.",2.0
"So this was a disappointing hidden object game because there were so many objects that made no sense in the scene, or in terms of what can physically be in  a location and also some that were completely hidden unless you used a hint to reveal it. Would have been worse if there had also been penalties for clicking randomly and repeatedly, because that's what you have to do. Not recommended",2.0
"...should have been the title. Which is a shame, because the opening sequences were well done and promised a good, solid FPS/3PS with a unique feel, and it performed well and looked very good on my computer. I especially enjoyed the underwater sequences with floating bodies, a sunken ship, and nasty looking fish, but the game soon deteriorated into endless hacking and chopping of an army of large crab-like beasts through never-ending caverns, all the while on my knees. Combine this with a monosyllabic ""hero""....no, wait. ""Monosyllabic"" implies some form of speech or communication. This Neanderthal doesn't even grunt. Conan the Barbarian is a poet compared to this guy and I'm supposed to care whether he lives or dies? Either way, I didn't make it through the first level before I returned the game. Perhaps you will have more patience than I.",2.0
"When I first bought this game, I was excited.  I was told the tactical realism is there, however, I feel that this game makes the United States Armed Forces look REALLY bad and weak.

PROS:
1. Sound Effects: the fire from the rifles sounds almost like the real thing.  You can hear the ping of the bolt as you fire your weapon.  The vehicles sound good too; every little bit of detail from the wining hum from the turbine engine of an M1 Abrams to the Blackhawk.  The vocal commands and the responses of your team as they take fire are amusing as they are somewhat accurate from what a Soldier would really say.

2. Soldier Movement: You can tell some thought was put into this.  Patrol Formations and the team's ability to perform Individual Movement Techniques (IMT).

3. Freedom of movement: There are hardly any limitations as to where you can go on the map.  Plus the objectives are not one-sided to where there is only one specific way to complete it.  You are allowed to come up with ways to adapt and overcome (if a time-limit is not the issue).

CONS:
1. Graphics: The enemy may sometimes look like your own men!
2. Game play: This area really stinks!  How can you take multiple hits from a 7.62mm round and not be stunned, turn around, and place one single-perfectly aimed shot to one's head?  When you're playing this game, you tend to lose confidence in your team's (or yours) ability to engage the enemy effectively.  It's like fighting a bunch of super-ninja robots!  They are not stunned when you shoot them and they can remain in perfect composure as they take a shot at your skull.  One rifleman in this game can take out your entire squad, even if you hammer the objective with indirect fire.  This makes our men look inferior and weak.  As far as realism goes,...the developers could have done a better job than this.  It seems that they don't like the Marines.  An American Infantryman, regardless of service, is trained to out-fight the enemy.  Assaulting a building...CRAP!  The command should be, ""go to that building and kill yourself.""

In closing, if you are just a gamer who wants a challenge then go ahead and try.  However, if you know anything about combat, this game WILL tick you off.  Be advised...",2.0
"Pros:
The bots, which most people complain about because they are brain-dead, are actually a good thing, because without them I would not be able to kill a single thing.

6v6. This is a good things also. If it was 32x32, I would only be able to play for 2 seconds instead of the 10 I get now before dying over and over and over.

Cons:
The game might be fun for about the first hour or so, and then it goes downhill quickly as there is no depth whatsoever. As the title says, all you will be doing is running, dying and spawning over and over and over.

The graphics are last generation at best. Not sure what the ""INSANE"" texture resolution setting is supposed to do because I sure as hell don't see any insane textures.

The ""campaign"". Honestly, I have played through one sides 8 missions and have absolutely no idea what the hell the campaign was about because I was too busy running and dying to actually comprehend what was going on. Also, I guess I completed the campaign by losing every single mission.

The size of the install. 30+ Gigs of sound that you can't even comprehend. It is just actors rambling in the background about some incoherent conflict that you don't have the time to listen to.

Auto-Aim gun is useless except for killing bots. Honestly, the 3 second lock-on time means you are always dead before you can get a shot off.",2.0
Damn this is a good product for its price the quality of mic is good and the adjustment for the size is awesome! But they put the speakers to close to your ears which makes it uncomfortable to wear for a prolonged period. Now this may just be I have big ears but still they seem oddly close to your ear which is really weird because for how little space they give your ear the sound quality isn't even that good. But for the price it does do what it needs to. I should have paid 10 extra dollars for comfortability. To add to that the shipping takes forever there was no option when I bought it to accelerate this and it even shipped to Florida when my address was set in New Mexico... but it did get to me eventually after multiple other products I ordered a week after came in at about the same time. The shipping time is the only thing that makes this a 2 star otherwise it's a solid 3 star which isn't bad for the price.,2.0
"You shouldn't have to be patient and wait for a game to get better. The playstation2 to this point is the most awful RPG system I have ever played. I miss the playstation already. This game is acceptable has a ""cute"" story but not an epic by any means, good rpg for newbies and kids.",2.0
I really disliked the control scheme to this game. I almost didn't finish the game because of it and its difficulty. Thankfully if you die enough times you'll get an invincibility token.

"right now the game is totally messed up....it has issues with loading different intervals and numerous sound related issues as well.  Please check out the forums on this game before you buy.

First off its attached at the hip to STEAM so getting tech support and issue resolution is nigh near impossible.

Secondly, the retail versions seem to be missing necessary pieces of code which aren't there and who knows when it will be there.

The game overall appears to be really good and I would have given it a higher score except for the all the issues which bring this puppy in at a very weak 1.

"This game is horrible, you mine as well buy Halo because that's what Activision turned this game into. If I had known this is what the game turned to them I wouldn't have bought it.  I'll stick with COD BO2 on Xbox 360. Comparatively AW is as big as a fail as gears of war judgment was. The only thing I can say that I like is the campaign mode, it's kind of long, has a good storyline, full of action and get access to a lot of cool weapons and exo gadgets.

"Unlike those professional reviewers, I'm just an average guy that pays for their games.  Pro reviews tend to review their free complimentary copies and have a conflict of interest because the same companies have ads on their site or magazines paying for their paycheck.  I on the other hand tells it like it is.  If you are a fanboy, good!  having passion for something is a good thing.  If you have a different opinion than I do, than lets discuss it intelligently and not call each other names.  Here is my review for NFS Hot Pursuit:

Pros -
- Cop mode
- It didn't freeze on me yet.

Cons - O where do I start?  Do you like games with the following features?

- Like burnout, there are places all over the map where there is divider that comes out of no-where and causes your car to crash.  Hence ending any chance of finishing the race within the allowed time.  VERY CHEAP.  No one likes this.
- Around 50 cars with a chance to buy more cars from their online store.  320 MS points for 3 cars.
- Terrible race courses that all look the same.  Trees, fences, rocks.. blah blah blah.  Feels very rushed.
- Annoying CRASH animations, after seeing it for the 1000th time, it ruins the immersion.
- Buggy AI where the NPC cars don't pull to the side when your cop car has the sirens on.
- Super annoying sirens that can't be turned off. Whats the point of having the sirens on if the NPC's (not the car I'm chasing) not pull over?  At least have the option to turn off the sirens.  I read the manual, there is a button to turn off the sirens, but it doesn't work.  BUG!
- Earn gold medals like Burnout, with impossible times without taking the shortcuts.
- Slippery soap physics that makes your car slide around like Ridge Racer 6.
- Same game as Burnout (but with cop mode) earn nitrous when you drive on the wrong side of the road, near miss, or tailgate another driver.
- Wall posts, a feature like facebook, but not really.
- All the cars in the same class feels the same.  Because the physics of this game is all out of wack, all cars are the same regardless of the attributes on your screen.  I'll give Criteron a break here since this is their first game with real world cars.  Amateurs.  Just their top speeds are different between classes.

Fun?  If like dropping $60 on a piece of crap fun.  Chances of selling this to someone else could be a stretch because I've already redeemed the online code.  Don't make the mistake of buying this game, just download the demo and call it a day.

Basically, the same game as Burnout, minus a lot of the fun burnout stuff, like stunt mode.  Same takedown stuff, but now you are a cop and can take down others.  Drivers can take out cops too.  Why don't you buy Burnout instead for $20.

If you like sniping headshots in call of duty or fast firing in halo you'll hate this, the controls are super mushy, driving is ungodly mushy, aiming is mushy, camera lag is extra mushy... it's like playing a shooter through a blanket.

"Someone at Microsoft, let's call him or her the worst person in the world, decided that Kinect games should be entirely controlled by waving your hands in the air. You hold out your hand and if your are lucky, a tiny white hand appears on the screen. This tiny white hand flies all over the place and an exciting jumping child does not help.

Disney could have said to Microsoft, ""hey, these games are for kids, let's use a menu system that kids can actually use"". There are some Kinect games that have forsaken the awful motion menu system. Kinect Party automatically starts up with fun content and switches game content all by it's lonesome. Dance Central 3 lets parents queue up songs with the Xbox controller or an iPhone. Disney went with Microsoft's awful menu system. The kids hate it.

Hate is not a strong enough word. The kids are excited by the ""idea"" of playing a Kinect game. The main menu teases them with video of all the fun game modes. Then the game forces my kids to guide the tiny white hand onto a game mode. Then they have to again guide the tiny white hand to the start button. Because choosing the game mode once should be sufficient, I assume the only reason Disney has my kids laboriously guide the tiny white hand twice is because Disney hates children.

The kid hating does not end with the menus. Disney then makes the kids wave their hands to enter every single menu and game mode. If the kids jump around too much, they need to wave their hands again. If the kids walk to far back or forward, they need to wave their hands again. My son complained his arm was getting tired.

"This review is from the tournament player point of view. I've been going to melee tournaments since 2004. Brawl is fun, hours of fun actually. Unlocking and all that other neat stuff. Plenty of characters and items. However, outside of better graphics and an amazing sound track, the game seems to lack in some places. The final smashes suck, after playing with them for a while, they get boring, or you pick the space animals for the best specials. Only one special per character, and here I thought they put some effort into the specials outside of just snazzy looks.

Great multiplayer fun, but it's hard to take this game seriously. After a few tournaments, I've come to notice that there aren't many exploits to make this game any deeper. Even heavy talk about banning metaknight. The games characters are disturbingly unbalanced which is a horrible thing. The speed in the game was horribly reduced, and it's probably due to the new physics engine being used. The first moment I played brawl, it didn't feel like a smash brothers game.

Everything floats, it's not possible to nail a successful combo. Even when you feel you are, the amount of stun was reduced, this leaves you to be able to quickly recover out of hits, and with brawls dodging, you're able to dodge quickly, and multiple amount of times. The knockback for some things seem either unreasonably low or too high. Some characters attacks have no knockback and have discovered infinites (Marth and Lucario on ness/lucas)

In melee, even with unbalanced character, there was always a counter to a character you could pick. This game, seems... to have so many character, but due to physics and stun in the game, every character will react to every character almost the same due to the float and how far they'll stray. Someone with no projectiles is at a horrible disadvantage with someone with a projectile. Someone slow is at a horrible disadvantage against someone quick. Someone who has short reach or bad range is probably going to lose to someone who has dislocated hitboxes or disturbing range. Hell, in melee, ganondorf and dk had no projectiles, but the physics and stun allowed them to still be dangerous characters, but the same can't be said about ganondorf and captain falcon in this game now.

My main hate towards this is that I can't enjoy this at tournaments. So, let me enjoy it online right? For a game like this, the lag shouldn't be this terrible, there are fighting games with MORE going on the screen than this game. How is it that they don't lag being countries apart yet I lag with someone a state away? Green, yellow, red connection? I don't want this crap. I don't mind paying for the service, I've always love smash bros and would love to play this game with very little to no lag. Noticeable lag is noticeable, and this game has a lot of it. Not to mention friend codes is a pain, and the amount of options for the game is actually embarrassing. Two play modes, quick match, or teams. You don't get the option of joining the games with your friends, displaying your name, or even better ranked matches. You're forced to find an online community to find people to play.

I picked this up at launch, and I really really really had high hopes for this. While I know it's a different approach to the game, I feel they took out a lot of what made smash brothers what is is. I feel they went nuts adding little pointless things, and a massive amount of modes (subspace emissary is a joke), and the one thing I had strong hopes for (the online) is just crap.

By all means, if you have a wii, this is a must own title. However, this was the only reason I had a wii, and I will continue to be disappointed with this release and will eagerly await for another smash.",2.0

"The developer shows signs that they put some quality into the game but also signs that they don't really know what their doing. Firstly the singleplayer might as well be called multiplayer story missions that you can play alone because they require just as beefy connection as the multiplayer which doesn't make sense. Most of the game is server side on the dev's end so if theirs hiccups in connection enjoy rubberbanding. Here they had the chance to oneup overwatch with an exclusive offline singleplayer experience but failed by just clustering the whole game together on a multiplayer platform.

The story missions have their problems mainly the lack of a save system at all theirs only checkpoints that back you up on losing a life. Fail a mission objective,lose all your lives... welcome to the annoyance of running that whole mission from the start. Other games have save systems like destiny while being always online but somehow it was beyond the dev's comprehension of how to implement it that they just said meh don't need it.

  Onto multiplayer okay here's one of my biggest gripes, I can tell who is going to win before a match starts just by the characters chosen. It doesn't take much skill to obliterate other players with the certain melee classes either, which shows how overpowering they are. The matchmaking system is a joke big time it's like waiting in an elevator awkwardly with other people when your already on the floor you want but some reason you can't exit. It also doesn't match people up fairly, I've seen level 20+ characters get put up against max level 7's.. sure they have a slim chance but when you factor in the overpowered characters theirs no way to win with mutations and better loadouts.  Yes patches can fix balance issues but makes one wonder what the heck beta was for if these issues still reside. Overall It's not a bad game by any means just not worth the price tag when the dev could've done much better.",2.0
"Game is poor in comparison with the other two games in the series. The plot wasn't too bad and the choice of endings was kind of neat. In my view, the downside weres as follows: (1) repetitive scenery--how many times do you go through the same building? (2) repetitve comments by the AI characters in the single player mode--how many times can you remind your partner that you are saving his a__? (3) too many chase scenes. These are ok for some, but I found them annoying. Overall, I suggest you save your money for another game.",2.0
"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings brings us ever so deeper into the world of Hobbits and wizards. The game is design to be a RPG, but doesn't deliver. The game lacks aside elements that make a complete RPG. The game could of use more interactivity with the environment, more things to do(the game will take you about three hours to beat!) and the graphics are not up to X-Box par. With that, it does include the adventure with Willow and Todd Bonbadil which is a little good addition to the game overall, but is forgotten later in while you progress. Although it may lack in dept, it makes up with a fun engine, supposily a RPG, it reminds me of a  platform: Worriors of Might and Magic, a good game, but not great.",2.0
This game looks terrible. I bought it for a cheap price and couldn't be bothered to open the game. I sold it for a profit and laughed all the way to the bank.,2.0
"This is a decent product but NOTHING HOLDS IT IN PLACE and thus if you're not careful when pulling out components from this add-on, you may break it and/or the PS3 usb port and junk the system !!! You have to put a finger on this unit each time you detach something from it to be safe or you may break the connectors and/or the usb ports on the PS3 console itself because it sits loose with only the usb's holding it in place.
