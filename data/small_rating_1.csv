"Plays like a racing game from the sega genesis era. Physics are non-existant, cars are basically glued to the road unless you hit a ramp or some other object that the programmers scripted to make you fly. There is no damage modeling that ive seen.

If you're old enough to remember big-red racing, it plays a lot like that, only without all the fun bouncy physics. This is not a sim, its an arcade racer, and not a very good one at that.

"The game looks fine, but it doesn't work. I bought 6 games from this seller, 5 of which did not work.",1.0
"First, Yes I do own this game, I bought it the day it came out.

The over game itself is fun and graphics are great. The game play suffers from the excessive commits from the game: Buzzkill, Avenger, Payback and all the other stupid things that pop up. There are way too many kill streaks that kill from the air, come on do we really need: Missiles, Helicopter and an AC130 gunship all at the same time.

The matchmaking system is horrible. It takes way to long to join a game. I am not kidding it takes about 5 min to join a game and the intermissions are way too long. There is no autobalance, you my start off on eventeams but since this game has a problem with dropping people to the lobby, you might be on a team 6 v 3. Also thaking about team size 6 v 6 sucks. What year is this 1980. You can play groundwar which is 9 v 9, but the lag is so bad most of the time; they should call lag war. I really dis like this game Left 4 Dead 2 comes out tonight so I will probley never play MW2 again.",1.0
"So I decided to pick this mess up on a gamestop buy two get one free sale.  Found a bunch of $8.99 games and paid about $6.50 each with tax(still feel like I got ripped off...especially on this one).  HORRIBLE graphics.  Sound variations are so minimal that you turn the volume down after about 5 minutes so you can stop hearing the same sounds over and over.  What were they thinking.  I mean, yes, there are a few games to play, yes they are mostly easy, but the graphics are TERRIBLE.  The quality just isn't there.  One of the games is so bad that we can't even do it (search for an outhouse in the dark with a flashlight).  The driving obstacle course is ridiculous.  You can't go as fast as possible and miss the targets, so you end up hitting everything if you are even slightly competitive.  Just plain boring.  Unfortunately my 10 and 8 year old girls like it so I can't sell it.  Ugh!  Wish I would have saved my money and found more games like Wii Sports and Wii Fit Plus.  Wii Sports Resort will be our next purchase (and Just Dance).",1.0
"False Product buy it on steam the lucky few that got it to work congratulations but buy it on steam a lot of people plus me got the there was a problem activating red faction guerrilla error even know the key came with the game and i can not contact anyone else but the seller they need to mark this as a false product and remove it i paid 4 dollars for it today when it was on sale and i get this message so fix it give me a new key or take it down.

What i do not understand is they want us to fix it when it is there issue make a steam version to we can buy it from steam i mean seriously i am not going to sit here and download programs from weird links to fix it my anti virus will pick the stuff up as Trojan horses and i am not going to trust them fix your guy's issue or send all of the people you ripped off a steam key?",1.0
"Well kids, I just returned the Xbox One my wife bought me after only a week of ownership. With the One being my first gaming console since the original Xbox I was in for a big shock.

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me. I'm not standing for it so back to the store the Xbox went",1.0
"Terrible, the 1TB hard drive is nice, but i still have the same problems as the other xbone models. The system looks like an 80s oversized VCR, the system overheats every 15 minutes, and the UI is ugly. Save your money and get a ps4!",1.0
"Really not impressed with this game, to start it freezes often on launch.",1.0
"This game is ridiculously over-priced for the less than sub-standard graphics I have EVER seen in a video game. As most of the reviewers have rightfully said, the controls are awkward. I played this game once and had to squint my eyes through it all to try to make out figures in the dark (not poetic...literally!!) atmosphere...it was no fun at all. Had me running up and down and shooting stuff that I can't see. Horrible graphics! Just Horrible!

The movie was excellent though. They totally botched the game. I un-installed it...took up 6GB of harddrive. OMG! for such lame graphics I do not understand.",1.0
Very good graphics and game add ons but made some levels nearly impossible to beat even on easy. The batmobile is horrible! I prefer the game without the car since the steering is bad especially since you have to drive it fast and smash into everything. At least I do.,1.0
After reading most reviews thought this game was going to be good. Not a fan of the mechanics or game play at all!,1.0
"This is a terribly overpriced dismal failure of a game. This is an overrated and overhyped expansion pack. Nothing more.

Problems:

No new weapons in multiplayer
No new vehicles in multiplayer
No new anything in multiplayer
3 new multiplayer maps that will be free in 2 to 3 months or at least offered for sale on Xbox live at that time for $15.00
All the previous Halo 3 Multiplayer maps which isn't that helpful if you are like me and have already purchased all of them.
Visor on the playable character in the campaign that obscures your vision.
Dark (entirely too dark) levels in the campaign.
Short campaign - about 5 hours on Legendary.
The ODST character dies about every 4 seconds when an enemy looks at him funny.
The AI enemy characters are consistently stupid, oftentimes running into walls while driving vehicles.
Night vision on your goggles puts an annoying outline on everything. This I believe is an attempt to hide the fact that bungie did nothing to improve the graphics in this game over Halo 3. Additionally they didn't do enough work on the design of enemies. Everything either looks too dark, or has an outline with the middle completely dark, or is ultra shiny. The Supervisor guy is hard to navigate while in menus and I found myself stuck more than a couple of times, just trying to get my visor to be clear again. Save yourself some money and don't buy this game!

Good Stuff about the game:
The cover art on the box is nice.
They marketed the game well.

"Cartridges fit into this socket very loosely and after an hour's worth of fiddling I still had not been able to load a game in a playable state, so I replaced it with the original which I can at least get to work.

it's not worth my time to try and get a refund. im just going to buy another one from a more reputable dealer outside of amazon.  annoyed.",1.0
"I bought this game originally looking for a long rpg or puzzle game, and the name was the appeal. I am glad, however, that Dreamfall: The Longest Journey turned out to be one of the quickest, easiest games I've ever played.

The game progressed in too many directions, but drunkenly bounced me from one side to the other until I collapsed in some ridiculous ending. The only long part about this game is the list of holes in the storyline. I am convinced that this game could be fun for a pre-adolescent female, but is waste of time for any adult or serious gamer.

Storyline: original, yet annoying and uninteresting
Graphics: par
Puzzles: easy
Battle system: horrendous

"Well I decided I'd pick one up today after reading up on this product and it seemed legit. The keys feel stiff especially the spacebar (then I found out a lot of people have that issue with the keyboard) and the keys make about as much noise as a chainsaw.

This keyboard is worth no more than $50 to me honestly. So I will return mine and get a brand that isn't razor but I'd figure I should give them a try.

I normally won't post a review like this but this keyboard is horrid.",1.0

"The Xbox One itself is glitchy, but feature rich. Small improvements over the original, but I don't hate it. This bundle, however, sucks blocky nuts in hell. Seriously. It was shipped without a disk, crashes near every time I try to play it, and has to be re-downloaded frequently. Several times a day I'm wasting time downloading instead of playing. Madden is still my favorite game, but this horrendous combination renders it virtually unplayable. I will never purchase a bundle like this again.",1.0

"Ug. One of the worst NES games I've ever played. The gameplay is one dimensional and boring, and the whole game is the same thing over and over forever. I kept playing it, hoping that something different would happen, like a bonus stage or some change in the gameplay, but no. You keep pressing the punch button until you reach the side of the screen, then you do it again. That's the whole game.",1.0
"decent attempt at a knock off, but its bootleg as hell. they should be selling these with crack so you can get something worth the money being spent.",1.0
"Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good.  I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago.  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face.  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market.  The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.

If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it.  But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so.  Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play.  I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit.  She was one of the originators of the ""running around half-naked female shooter/adventure"" type of video games.  In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks.  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.

Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad.  This is one of those cases.  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke.  I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game.  Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)

It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete.  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.

By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series.  Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.

At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels.  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore.  I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good .  Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight.  But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.

Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem.  She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to.  You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier.  The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.

BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them).  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made.  Let the series END already.",1.0

"This is as bad as Bioshock with lack of ammo in the campaign. It takes a whole clip to kill 1 guy then you have to loot bodies after every kill to get a gun with ammo.  Resident Evil is one thing, but this is a first person shooter not a survival game.  I didn't play the multiplayer, other games are far better if you want to do that.",1.0
I'll be brief. I HATE this game. The controls are so complicated I STILL can't play it after owning it for a year. If TNA does another videogame I sure hope they make it easier for those of us who don't have 3 thumbs. Much like TNA lately this is a huge disappointment. I recommend ANY WWE game over this stinker,1.0

"This game is fun when searching for hidden objects, however, when it comes to solving the ""puzzles"" at the end of each level, there are really no instructions or clues on how to do it.

"My intention with this review is to provide a rather different oppinion from most reviews here which qualify this game with an average 4.5 stars.  I purchased this game for my son for two reasons:  The price drop and the excellente reviews.  I had no previous knowledge of Rayman, so I came unbiased to play it. I own 3 titles from Spyro the Dragon (games that have always satisfied my son) Jak and Daxter (PS2) and Crash Bandicoot ""Wrath of Cortex"" (Xbox), and my son plays all of them very regularly.  I personally like these games very much so I expected Rayman 2 to be a great platformer game.  Well, the thing is that my son played Rayman 2 for about an hour and a half and never picked it up again, I myself had to play it in order to understand what was wrong, but then I understood him.
First: the graphics, I have read in every review, even the newer ones, that the graphics are excellent and so on.  Well, to my opinion the graphics can not even match Spyro 3 on the PSOne, they are graphics that are ok for an early launch on the PS2 but can not be compared to the possibilities that we are getting today, and I refer in this case to Jak and Daxter, where the developers (Naughty Dog) have done a beautiful job on this subject.  Second: the voice acting, what can I say, I personally found the constant whispering (instead of real voices) very annoying, I even thought there was some kind of malfunction in the CD because of this, until I realized that those whispers WERE the voices.  Third: the story, even though it is a typical platform story, there is no fun in it, I personally found it very boring, and I couldn't play it for more than half hour before I could fall asleep.
I truly wish that I could find something good about this game, but the truth is that I had to sell it one day after I got it, neither my son nor I liked this game.  If you truly want to play a good platformer then go for Jak and Daxter, there is no comparison (great graphics, hilarious voice acting -even in spanish-, good story and lots of fun), or wait for the PS2 version of Spyro the dragon, or even play the PSOne versions of Spyro, I can assure you that you will have more fun with those than you will with Rayman 2.  I was deceived by the price drop and the good reviews, and made a terrible mistake: wasted [money], so don't fall for the same, this game can only and hardly diserve the one star I gave it.",1.0
"game is hard to control, you have to use severl button on your key board at once for some moves and it get tiring after about 15 minutes of play, i found the game boring and hard to control, graphics were not that great. i played if for two day than took it off my pc.",1.0
"What the Crap?!?! Whenever I put the cartridge in my 3DS the top screen just shows TV fuzz and the bottom screen shows the picture of the kid on the cover. Theres also a really, really loud sound of a kid laughing coming out of the speakers... its so creepy o. O Do NOT Buy this ""Game"", it's nothing more than a creepy scam!! How do I even get to the game?! Is there even a game?! WTH!!",1.0
"I would've easily given this a 5 star rating if it had split screen.  I bought this game with expectations going head to head against my family and friends.  I started up the game ready to play and I noticed there is not option for split screen.  I was HIGHLY dissapointed due to the fact that I do not use a Gold membership currently.  I do not spend enough time online playing against people to spend the amount it's worth for a Gold membership.  So now I'm sitting here just playing single player and no longer can compete with anybody.  It's not the same without split screen!

The overall game itself is quite fun though.  The graphics are stunning and mechanics are amazing.  But I can't manually shift gears? Come on EA you guys stink at NBA games and are barely at par with your NFL games, and just when I thought I could put faith in you guys with your racing games, I'm dissapointed by your lack of split screen feature.  EA has become really greedy and are forcing people to purchase not only a gold account, but a seperate account just for multi-player.  Never am I going to purchase an EA product, until changes are made!!

"I really didn't know anything other than it was a free roaming universe game. What a disappointment, a few months later i'm still out $60 and deleted it after a week to make room for actually worth while games. I'll never blindly buy a game because it looks cool again.",1.0
I played the game on the Xbox when it first came out and really liked it but it had a ton of problems. Got the PC version on sale for $12 bucks figured they would have it fixed by now. Nope spent the last 30 mins trying to get into a match but it just keeps saying connection lost. Avoid this piece of trash like the plague. The game is great when it works. The problem is it works less than 10% of the time.,1.0
"First, let me start off by saying that I am no computer dummy.  I have been around computers for over 20 years.  It's safe to say that I know what I am doing.  Secondly, I have a very high-end, very powerful gaming computer, on which I have played many large and complicated games.  I have never had one freeze up on me, EVER!  This game freezes up at least 75% of the time.  I choose a game mode, and when I go to tee off, it freezes on the loading screen.  It has nothing to do with my graphics card, because I am able to practice and I have managed to play a few amateur games.  However, I am now stuck, because everything that involves making money that I try to do causes the game to freeze.  TW 2004 NEVER did this on my computer, and I loved that game.  This game is great, when I can play it, but EA really didn't work out the kinks on this.  Shame on them.",1.0
"I know, the title sounds pretty extreme, but I do not want to leave any doubts about this 'game'. I'll be short with my points as there are too many problems to go in to depth.

The game renderer is severely buggy. Animation stops, characters disappear, surfaces flash and disappear.  Sound stops and pops, keyboard input is lost for seconds at a time. No driver updates on my system changed this (it's a quad xeon with a 512mb video card and 4GB of ram, very fast and up-to-date). I get about 7-15 frames per second.

The design of the maps appears to be very amateur and are quite ugly. Most objects have one dull repeating texture. The shapes of most objects are really unrealistic and aesthetically repulsive.  Either no artists were involved in its creation, or there is something very wrong with the game engine that hinders them. I refuse to believe there are artists that bad.

Character animation is really poor, as if the developer had no interest in animation better than say, a 3D title from 1990.  the player is animated in slow motion, I assume to slow down the pace beyond glacial.

Combat is a mindless button mashing and timing exercise much like EQ and its copy WOW, but even less fun to watch. The timing is roughly three times slower than WOW and EQ. It can take three or four minutes to fight one lower level monster, and more than ten for higher monster. It's incredibly boring. To the point where I lose interest and would ignore screen if my character was not in danger of dying at all times. There is no choice in fighting monsters, anything two levels higher can flatten you in two hits, they chase you to the end of the earth, and run faster than you.

Almost no one is playing. Literally. I saw three people after six hours of play, And two of the the three there were very rude fan-boys. None wanted to play in a group. there are no populated outposts, just camp after camp of non-player characters giving lame quests. All the broadcast channels for player chat are off, there is no way to find other non-local players to ask for advice or help.

Monsters or opponents are spread out evenly so you sit there and pull one. Then fight it, then another, fight it... ad infinitum. Until you can walk to wherever. All monsters re-spawn in a matter of seconds so the monster you just killed will pop up right behind you while you fight the next, and attack you. In many cases they re-spawn immediately after dying. This game manages to faithfully preserve one of the lamest conventions of MMOs.

Out of the thirty or so quests I did, all but a few were 'kill seven bears', and 'kill seven wolves. How do the quests change later? 'Kill twelve bears', and 'kill twelve wolves', a few seemed different, but essentially were deliveries or bosses. There is nothing of interest in the world but assigned quests.

The classes are just rehashes of every other MMO that came before. All of the skills I encountered were mundane. Click a button and you hit for 16 more damage. Click another and it's 12 more damage, etc.

There are about seven monster models (as far as I went) with just a name change to designate what they are. A grey wolf, kit, wolf pup, and whatever else, are all just a chalky white dog model with different text floating above them.

The day is seventy two minutes I believe, so it's constantly flipping from day to night as if the planet is suffering from some neurosis. This happens so fast yet there are no shadows so it just seems like the lights are going out. Daylight is really dim looking on top of it all. Of course the player moves as if it's a seventy two hour day.

This game has constant lag, while the other online games I play do not. Lag is also devastating. You don't go slower or have a minor hiccup, you just suddenly have different health, are somewhere else, are dead. etc.

The world is big and open, and pretty much empty and featureless. Combine the barren world with the horrid art, and visually It's like playing a non-cartoon themes version of WOW, with even less noticable scenery. The monotony is broken up by rocks though. Giant rocks all with identical surfaces that are shaped unlike any real rocks.

Character creation seems to be little more than a feature to put on the box. It's useless as the characters all look the same (very ugly). The armors and clothing in the game stick through each-other and as stated above, appear to be designed and created by an  an amateur.

It takes up to five minutes to log in, because the launch utility checks all your files every time. Once that happens  the game sits there with a drawing of who knows what (it's not related to the game) until it loads.

Death penalty is harsh for two reason. You will die a lot due to the draconian control over your choices as a player (you can not fight outside your level because it's designed to make the smartest and stupidest player completely equal, yet random high level monsters are tossed in lower areas). You will die when encountering bugged monsters that suddenly can no longer be hit or lose health, but they still can kill you. On top of it all it costs more to repair your items than you will ever make. Also you have to run back to continue your quest, and all the monsters will be alive again.

They charge money for it. It would be inaccurate to describe this game as not quite finished. It's not really anything but the most rudimentary and broken beginnings of a poor game, yet they are actually telling people it's done and accepting money. Maybe it can't be called fraud as a legal charge, but it's certainly misrepresentation.

So to be blunt. It's bad. Before this game I didn't think I could reccomend a game a sbad as World of Warcraft over anything, but WOW is better than this game. In fact I don't think any MMO I have played before even comes close to being this bad.",1.0

"I love Harvest Moon. I've played and bought every HM that Natsume has released since 1998, and I have never been so disappointed in one of their games before! You would think that after being delayed almost 2 months after the regular DS release and the promised pre-order date that this game would be perfect, right?

Wrong.

After countless hours of playing, I decided to take my horse and cart into the mountains for the first time, since I was regularly running out of backpack space. As soon as I tried to reach the summit, my ENTIRE 3DS SYSTEM completely froze!!! I had to wait several hours until the battery died so that I could take the cartridge out and turn the system back on.

This happened to me about 10 times before I finally got fed up and exchanged it at GameStop. Guess what - same problem! EXACT SAME PROBLEM! I finally just got my money back and bought Zelda: Skyward Sword instead. Take my advice: Until Natsume debugs all of their games and tests them, don't waste your money. Your 3DS will spend more time on the table draining its battery than it will in your hands entertaining you.",1.0
"I know nobody will read this but here it goes.  The developers are done, they are completely out of ideas.  They need to go back to world war 2 or at least decide what future we are fighting for.  Yes the multiplayer is good. but its a cookie cutter from all the others.  This game could have been DLC for the last one.  This game felt like Titanfall on its way towards Halo CE.  Anyone remember the ship sinking/jumping to the helicopter in COD 4.  When's the last time COD has come close to that.  Still a little better than the last two POS's they put out.  Zombie's mildly interesting.",1.0
"The console itself is designed fairly well. It puts out a lot of heat, but unlike the 360 it does not have any reliability issues. One problem with the vents though, is they exhaust out the right side of the console if you have it laying horizontally. Anything sitting to the right of the console in that situation will get baked. The controller is not bad, but Sony is releasing a new controller with rumble next year, so it would be a waste of money to buy the console with the obsolete controller at this time. One nitpick with the controller is the USB/charging port is on the top of the controller, so charging docks require you to insert the controller upside down to charge them. Also, the batteries is internal and requires unscrewing the controller apart to replace. It uses a proprietary battery as well.

As far as games go, take a look at the release list yourself. There is absolutely nothing worth buying at this point. The only exclusives worth buying are not coming out until late 2008/early 2009, so you may as well wait another year or two and enjoy the other 2 systems out that have plenty of great games worth buying right now.

Simply put: Sony released the PS3 a year too early. None of the software, from the games, to the firmware of the console itself, was ready to go at launch. They should have waited until X-mas 2008.",1.0

"I played the demo of this game, and quickly realised that I would not be paying for the full version.
I think it's a reflection of the game that used versions are currently selling at very low money, and it is a real shame, when this game COULD have been a winner.
You are a secret agent type assassin given several tasks that involve thinking and sneaking around, instead of the usual guns blazing approach, and the graphics, levels, enemies, weapons, and scenarios are actually very very good. There is ONE big problem however, you CAN'T SAVE your progress as you go. Even if you play this game on the easiest level,you will find it very frustrating. There is a fine line between a game that isn't easy to beat, and one that's annoying as anything, and this one jumps that line with size 12 boots. You will find yourself playing for a long time, reaching so far in a level and then getting killed off, only to go back and start from scratch. I hope the programmers have learned from their mistakes as I see a sequel is now available. If you really like this kind of game, try ""Soldier of Fortune"" instead, it's much more rewarding.",1.0
"I have Windows XP and everything that the game required, yet I couldn't move two inches (slowly too) without the game freezing up.

"I admit it, I have something of an ulterior motive in rating this game so low.  It's a good football game, really it is.  However, after playing EA Sports titles for the past decade, I've discovered a football game I like much better.  Unfortunately, because of EA and the NFL's greed, exclusive rights to NFL licensed products has been granted...meaning we will not get an ESPN NFL 2K6 game.  Hence, I will no longer be playing EA titles.  For any serious gamers out there that welcome competition among our titles, thus ensuring that the best products are available, join my in my boycott.  Like I said earlier, I prefer the bulk of EA's sports titles to the ESPN brand.  However, I think their NHL and NFL products are surperior to EAs.  But I'll no longer have a choice in NFL products.  I'm not happy with either EA or the NFL.",1.0
"As far as console-based racing games go, the Forza line has been the best around. The series has not been perfect -- poor online gameplay for some entries in the series, limited selection of cars, and unrealistic AI car behavior -- but they have been semi-realistic and, most importantly, fun. Unfortunately, with Forza Horizon (FH), Turn 10 (it is Microsoft after all, so what do I expect, I guess) has tried to break into the arcade-based market that has been dominated by the Need For Speed and Midnight Club entries. Such games can be fun if you're not interested in anything approximating reality in terms of driving experience because you get to do things with cars that you would never be able to do in real life. However, FH does not fall into this category and is just plain dull.

The virtual world -- Colorado -- in which the game is set is beautifully rendered, and for about 45 minutes it is interesting to simply drive around. But the fun is short-lived. The ""races"" are either boring beyond compare, or are set up simply to frustrate the user by purposely putting civilian cars in the way at the most inopportune times or by having AI competitors get in front of you and purposely slow you down (this last aspect has always been a frustrating feature of the Forza line). (Note: I do not play online as there are waaaaaay too many kiddies who are simply interested in ruining online play.) It's always amazed me that Forza AI cars can be so easily passed, but once they have been, they seem to then be running NOS as they easily catch, pass, and then block you. FH is no different in this regard.

This ""racing"" game also pretty much plays on every possible cultural stereotype: all the women are nearly naked bimbos on display, all the young white males are gangsta' wannabes, and every African American talks like he's a gang member from Law and Order. You expect this in something as lowly as Grand Theft Auto, but in a racing game it's nothing but offensive (yeah OK, it's offensive in GTA too). I would not want a child to play this game for this reason.

Bottom line: this game may be worth a short-term rental, but don't buy it.",1.0

"I wanted to love this game. I played 7 playthroughs of the original trilogy * 30 hours per game playthrough * 3 games, so I know a thing or two about Mass Effect. This is almost Mass Effect, but not quite. It goes through the motions, but lacks the soul of the originals. This game feels like fan fiction - some stuff is actually well done, but it isn't all there. I invested time getting to know the characters, but still felt nothing for them.

I would say I fault Bioware for dropping the ball, but I don't know if it's their fault. In all reality, making good games is hard and they captured lightning in bottle in the original trilogy. Hard to do that twice.

"This was a waste of money for me.  Some of the things I dislike are the fact that zones are dependant on roads.  You cannot place a zone without a road.  There is no indication that I could find on what a particular zone needs to advance to the next wealth level.  The banking system is one of the things that bug me most.  No city makes a profit every single month all the time.  Sometimes cities run out of money and run in the red.  If you are going to make the game auto pause each time this happens, then you need to be able to determine the percentage of funding your utilities and such get.

I hate the fact that I cannot save the game independently.  And there is no undo button.  If I accidentally place a sewage treatment plant in the middle of a residential zone, I'm out all the money, and either have to deal with all the unhappy people, or wait till I get the money again.  Add the small map sizes, and I honestly feel like I'm playing the very first version of sim city, but with improved graphics.",1.0

"This is the worst knockoff Wii remote I've ever seen. First let's talk about the Nunchuck, it doesn't last. It's been maybe three weeks of usage, and now when I play one of my favorite games, Super Mario Galaxy 2, it will randomly move me in random direction without me touching the Nunchuck. Now about the quality, it feels enough like a real Nunchuck that I don't really care about the quality.

Now let's talk about the worst part, the actual Wii controller. This time I'm going to first talk about the terrible, horrible, quality. The silicon case barely even fits, and the rumble is loud and doesn't shake much. Now, does it work. Well, I guess it works, but not if you more than 15 feet away from the consol, if you are, well, it will just disconnect, reconnect, disconnect again, reconnect, and repeat, over and over again until you come into range

Well, if it works, then why do I hate it so much? Well, after about three weeks of usage, you guessed it, it broke, just like the Nunchuck, and if you're thinking that it was just the remote, not the Nunchuck, well, I tried the Nunchuck with another Wii remote, this time made by Nintendo, it still didn't work.

If I were you, I'd just get the Wii remote and Nunchuck from Nintendo for only double the price, but at least it won't break on you after three weeks.",1.0

"I have played the first three and found them enjoyable. From what I have seen, I am not real thrilled with this one, and even less thrilled with the fact that they could not put it on a disk. Their downloads are extremely slow, even after making sure the firewall allowed it. After I did that, it started out at 14 mbps, but fell off to 1 - 2 mbps. I have Fiber Optics for an Internet connection and my rig is running an i7 6700k CPU, 16 gb of Ripjaws 4 DDR4 RAM, EVGA GTX 1080 FTW GPU on an ASUS Z170 Pro Gaming Motherboard and Samsung 1Tb 850 EVO SSD for storage. I started the installating at around 4:30 yesterday afternoon and it was finished about mid morning this morning. After all that, it is unplayable. Buying this game for a PC is a total waste of money and will remain until the idiots realize that PC games are to come on Disks, NOT this crap. There are issues with the cloud ( failure to connect ) and will not play and save locally. Admittedly, I had the same issue with GoG in so far as the cloud saves, but it does save locally, so no problem. Should I have to do an uninstall, I would just have to move the save files to another drive. There are NO issues with Steam, in that regard and both Steam and GoG have fast install speeds. I can install about 5 Bethesda games in my Steam Library in about 3 hours. The Witcher 3 in my GoG Library is 34 Gb or so and doesn't take a lot of time. I would NOT recommend buying this for the PC, as from my experience it wioll be a waste of money and unplayable. EA has ruined the gaming experience with this crap they are doing.

"I've pretty much played this game since it came out. It's tons of fun on single player and if you can get a good, stable fast connection to the host, multiplayer is a blast with a decent team. However, for about the last year (Since Cold Harbor DLC was released), the server hosting has become atrocious and nearly rendered the game unplayable. You're lucky to find 1 good server connection out of 10 and even then, don't expect to finish a whole campaign. You might get 3 levels maybe 4 if your incredibly lucky. Before Cold Harbor, the problems were only a nuisance, now they render the multiplayer game unplayable on xbox 360. I have no idea about pc connections but they can't be this bad.

So, I have not played the game, and I'm writing this review because of the ineptitude put into the game's execution, and my inability to even activate the game. If Ubisoft's DRM servers are failing, or the game's DRM itself, I don't know, but this is what happens when you always require a ""phone home"" DRM, and it doesn't work: legitimate buyers are screwed.

"Graphics on PS3 are very laggy and poppy. Otherwise they're no different from BF3.

In BF3 the shooting mechanics were COD-ized to fight MW3. Here they're simply in disarray. The majority of shooting consists of simply running into someone else, shooting blindly and hoping you hit someone. Shooting in this game almost feels similar to shooting in Fallout 3. Its like shooting with chopsticks.

In BF3 Sniping/Recon was made more challenging but equally do-able, at least in hardcore. In regular mode it was basically useless. Here they screwed sniping further by making no standard sniping/open maps. The ones that do exist can only be accessed by purchasing map packs for like 20 dollars. In fact, half of all maps can only be accessed through map-packs, post-purchase downloads. So someone buying everything ends up investing like 200 into a videogame. Its insane.",1.0
"I am a big fan of Survival Horror games and recently Ive been going back and playing older titles I never got a chance to play.

To sum it up as simple as possible this game was TRASH. The controls were among the worst I've ever had to deal with.  The Weapons in this game are HORRIBLE. You basically get 1 Rifle the whole game and just keep getting little add ons which are confusing to use.

This game felt like a job really. Never at ANY point in this game did I feel like I was having fun or even partially enjoying myself.

All I know is this change in some ways changed my perspective on video games of the past.  Theres really no point in going back and beating old garbage video games. If a game was made more than a few years ago and you haven't played theres probaly a good reason why. IT SUCKS like this pathetic knockoff resident evil TRASH....

"Normally, I would not leave a negative review about a product for this reason.  In fact, I would probably trash someone else for doing it.  The camera's cable is as long as it is and there is no promise that it will ever be extendable.
I have to break my own rule here since I think this needs to be said.  Most people (myself included) who may need an extension for their camera didn't even give it a 2nd thought since the PS3 camera is so easily extendable with a standard USB 2.0 extension cable (available everywhere in every length and color imaginable).  Then we come to find out that they changed the connector end and have no official or unofficial statement about how they plan to handle the considerable amount of customers who need an extension for this device.  Many have returned the camera for this reason or have it sitting unused until someone steps up and solves this problem.  Others (like myself) are a little luckier because I can plug my camera into my PS4 BUT I have to plug it in every time I want to use it because all my equipment is inside a cabinet and also have to unplug it when I am done so the door will close.  With an extension, the cable will run behind my TV into the wiring channel that leads to inside the cabinet and I can leave it plugged in all the time.  Anyone who wants to trash me for this, I consider it fair game.  I won't defend myself.
Please note that I waited until a month and a half after the release date to post this.  I wanted to give them some time to address to the issue.  I can excuse the fact that they (Sony) may not have been aware of how many people extended the PS3 camera since they didn't even sell extensions and tracking the sales of any USB extension cables would be silly since they can be used for tons of other reasons.  But they have certainly heard more than enough about this need by now.
How about just a little hope (""We are planning on releasing an extension cable for the PS4 camera in the near future"").

UPDATE 11/1/2014 - Finally got a cable.  I ordered it from Amazon UK.  Very bizarre, still not available on the US site and while myself (and others, as I can tell by reviews) were able to order it and have it shipped overseas, it is now listed as ""can not be shipped to the United States"".  What the ????? is going on with this stupid cable?  It works.  It works perfectly.  From one review on the UK site, I did find out that you can not string 2 extensions together, so there is a limitation, but the one extension still DOUBLES the length.
In the mean time I found out that Best Buy has them for $20 here in the US.  Also, an FYI to anyone who said that any extension would be too expensive, even the one I got shipped from the UK was only $28 USD including shipping.",1.0

"Don't be fooled by the neat graphics of the title and cut scenes, nor by the title that makes it seem that it would be something like a game from the Harvest moon franchise or Animal Crossing. This game was very poorly designed and is no fun at all.

The worst part is the little farm that you start in. It looks like a disaster and there is nothing you can do to change the position of the default of where the grass and plants are growing. Also, usually in a game like this, exploring the inside of your house or the animal shed can be fun, but this game doesn't have that. Instead, every time you enter one of these places, it automatically takes you to a menu, full of choices that are mostly irrelevant at the beginning of the game, while at the same time teasing you with a background picture that looks like it should be an explorable part of the game.

At the beginning, it's hard to figure out what to even do. You run around the farm, but you have no tools or items, you have overgrown plants blocking your path to certain areas, you have these two animals that were dropped off willy nilly running around that you can't do anything with except pick them up or drop them. After doing this for about half an hour, you realize that you cannot progress any further in the game until you hit the L1 button to make time go by quicker, after which another of your neighbors will finally give you a sickle.

The most frustrating part of the game is the stupid fence. Once you pick it up (which you have no choice but to do since it's part of the tutorial at the beginning, you can't continue the game without doing this) you will never be able to enclose it again. The play control is so horrible, that sometimes the fence falls vertical, sometimes horizontal, and it always bounces a little. Basically they become mere obstacles more than places to keep the animals.

"Nyko has got to come up with something better and actually test it out with multiple types of gamers for extended periods of time before they send something like this to market.  I don't mind if its bulky as long as its comfortable.  What I DO mind is if the bulk gets in the way of normal operation.  I, like millions of others, don't use the tips of my index fingers to pull the left and right triggers.  Even depressing the buttons 1/3 of the way has the ends of my index fingers hitting the battery pack.  That's unacceptable for me.  A kid or adult with really small hands may not have any issue.  But an adult with normal size hands is gonna have to either force themselves to get used to it or they're gonna return the thing and give it a bad review as I'm doing now.  I didn't have any issues installing the thing though so that's a positive i guess.

To test if this will work for you don't simply put a controller in your hands.  No, you need to play and periodically freeze and then look/feel where your index fingers are.  If you're using the tips of your fingers to depress the triggers with no more than 1/4 inch hanging passed the triggers then it MIGHT be worth a shot.  If your index fingers kinda wrap around the triggers at all then forget about it.  And that's just the index finger issue.  I haven't even discussed the MIDDLE finger issue.  My middle fingers have nowhere to go b/c of the shape. There's simply no comfortable place for them to rest on the back.  They just flop around constantly searching for somewhere to sit.  I read some of the reviews and wanted to like this thing but it just doesn't feel natural.  My advice is to pass and wait for Nyko to redesign it or for a competitor to put out a superior product.

This game is awful. The dialog is horrible and super corny. The gameplay would be awesome if it weren't so glitchy. I got to multiple parts where ghosts or friendly AI got stuck in walls and I had to restart missions to get past it and hope that it didn't happen again. This is unacceptable! Most of your time is spent reviving fallen ghostbusters whose cries for help NEVER STOP! They keep saying the same thing over and over again. It's annoying and takes away from the fun of throwing proton streams. Not to mention the damn loading screen every time you die takes forever and plays the same song every time. I used to like the theme to Ghostbusters but now it's so played out from that loading screen. It's a real shame. This should have been awesome. How did they mess this up? Did I mention how bad the dialog is? Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd really missed the mark here.,1.0

"Only one of the two included microphones worked out of the box.  I got the game for the microphones to go with Rock Band 3, so this was very disappointing.  The actual game itself isn't nearly as good for singing as Rock Band 3 in my opinion; it doesn't seem as polished or fun.  The song list is somewhat limited, though you do get to watch music videos for some of the songs while you play.  Unfortunately, the older songs that I actually tried didn't have music videos, so it plays a generic video that doesn't make a lot of sense.

I would recommend getting it for the microphones if both worked, as the one that does work is pretty good.",1.0

(The thing is so proprietary that I can't easily troubleshoot the problem, and I don't want to send it in for local repair because I heard they swap out the original chip for a later one, and that chip alone could be worth more than what I original paid for this useless piece of garbage.)",1.0

"If everyone has the same problem with a game, that's a bug. You shouldn't have to play a game 9 times to get through it. I've had characters disappear on screen, not be able to interogate witnesses, evidence be collected, and then disappear. Ubisoft (the games manufacturer) says it is a noted problem, but the patch they gave does not work, for all the problems. I feel that they rushed this game out to capitalize on the past success of the previous game. Time between announcement of release and release was a scanty 6 months. Is that enough time to put out a quality computer game?
Also I had one other complaint about the game. Now it wants the CD in the disk drive for it to work, and it doesn't matter which cd. In the previous version, you could do a full install and not need the cd for it to run, which I thought was a definite plus.
So wait for a unbugged version, or get the original version, which even though it was short, it worked. Don't waste your time or money on this. I was extremely disappointed, as I love CSI.",1.0

"(May contain spoilers):

It's basically a space version of Mine Craft with repetitious cycle of mining ores and materials to gain money to which you go from planet to planet doing.

There is some battle like whenever enemy ships try attacking you in space. But that's about it. It rendered from what my roommate played and statistically logged, the same planets with slight variations to which elements were on the planet.

The visuals are about the only entertaining, the transition between Warp drives and stuff are pretty cool. But after awhile you would rather watch paint dry or type and debug code.  It's very boring, plus there's been no real updates since launch. The game crashes a lot on the PS4. I bought it for my roommates bday, and he's already bored of it.

Also,  I read that the center of the universe was nothing special. So what's the point of the game when everything renders the same over and over again? Literally everything has some sort of common variation and it gets very very boring after one hour.

If you like these types of games, I'd highly recommend it. If not, I would not buy it since the developers don't seem to care about the community and the game isn't anything as what it was advertised. Seriously 59.99 for an indie game? It's not worth more than 9 in my opinion. Minecraft has a better story line. I'm not saying all Indie Games are like this, but it was definitely false advertising on their part.",1.0

"I wanted this game for months. Finally bought it and oops, you actually only download the Key and a link to the Steam website. So, I downloaded Steam, installed the game, and started playing. Of course I couldn't turn subtitles off because for some reason the option refused to show up, but I can live with a couple minor bugs. I played Star Wars Galaxies at launch so I can handle buggy games.

So, I run around doing my quests, and oops, criticals aren't really reliable. Shoot a psycho in the face, got maybe an 80% chance of actually scoring a critical. Oh, and if you shotgun someone in the face point blank? Maybe a 10% chance. Oh, and assault rifles are useless. Either their damage is too low, or they fire slower than your sniper rifle.

So, I finally work my way through chapter one, and I get to the final boss. I'm full ammo, have about 15,000 in money, my health's full, my shields are nearly 200, and I have all my badass ranks in crit damage, gun damage, elemental chance, and elemental damage. I have a good sniper rifle and a pistol that lights people on fire. Even with all the bugs, I've burned through the first chapter pretty quickly and only have died once due to bad luck.

I proceeded to die so many times I had no ammo, no money to buy more ammo, and anytime I got the boss down to about 1/3 health he'd auto-heal back to full and I'd have to do it all over again. And again. And again. And again X10. So I finally just turned the game off to calm down. Turned it back on and oops, I have ammo again, but now I have to run all the way across the ENTIRE GAME MAP to get back to the boss fight since the fast travel system wouldn't take me back.

This is a dark, depressing game with practically no story line or emotional involvement.  The weapons are weak and unsatisfying.  The music is boring.  The user interface is overly complicated and difficult to master.  The introductory sequence is painful to wade through.  There's way too much tl;dr content.  And on top of all that the game locks up randomly, requiring a console reset.  The one pro is that you can save your game at almost any point.

Then in the morning I finally got it to be recognized...... but now it is recognized as ""Razer Bootloader"" and it still won't do anything. I am seriously considering returning this because I have purchased 3 razor products and all of them have had connection and driver issues.

(Update) Ok so apparently the firmware updater updated with a bad file so I had to manually download another, but after careful inspection of the connection port, and the knowledge that both the other blackwidow keyboard i have and my imperator mouse have continuing disconnection issues that updates are not fixing. I have decided that the way the cable is connected into the keyboard is extremely flimsy and exposed. I can also move the connector once it is in..... That is not good enough. I've tried to be understanding of Razer and have given them more than enough chances but its those little things where they should have built something better or actually thought of the placement and how it will be effected.

Well let me tell you something, this game is not even worth cracking or downloading the pirate version if there is one.  The game is buggy, the graphics are outdated, and there is nothing new in the game play. Just my humble opinion, a friend of mine made the mistake of buying it and he showed it to me. Now, he can even get rid of it on Ebay because nobody will buy it.  I guess they accomplished what they wanted to do, kill the second hand market.  COD4 sold thousand of copies and the game doesn't have intall limits.  YES, good games don't need crappy DRM. I can live with a CD check...

Let me tell you what you get: 2 installations for a bad buggy game.  So, if you own a desktop and a laptop and you would like to play the game on both PCs like I do.  I take my laptop when I travel, then you would have used up all your installations.  This means that if one PC fails or you upgrade your hardware, you have to call Customer Support.

"This is not like the original Soldier of Fortune games.  Lame checkpoint save system that doesn't work correctly all of the time (i.e., you'll see multiple ""save game"" textual pop-ups, but if you die, you restart at the beginning of the level in my experience). Ridiculously unrealistic boss fights where 200+ rounds need to be dealt to a single man who isn't wearing body armor in order to ""kill"" him. A drastically toned down body dismemberment system (contrary to the advertising about this game being true to previous games in the way you can shoot parts of the enemy body off, while you ""can"" shoot pieces off, this isn't anywhere near as graphic as the previous SoF games were).  Irritating Doom 3-style enemy spawns in areas you've already cleared (i.e., on one level, you'll shoot a sniper out of a tower and as you advance over a bridge another sniper magically appears in the tower in his exact place and starts head shooting you...)

The level environments are very linear with little or no reward for attempting to explore out of the way areas and machine gun placements are poor and nearly unusable in their turn radius (i.e., in one part of a level, I grabbed a stationary machine gun hoping to mow down droves of enemies in a mindless one way fire fight and the tangos spawned so far to the left that the gun couldn't turn to actually shoot them...I had to unequip the mounted MG and switch to a scope-equipped weapon to take them down before they killed me).

"all the way to the bank! Ever since EA Sports bought the exclusive rights to the NFL License, Madden NFL hasn't changed much except for the usual roster updates, slightly more polished graphics, etc. I wish that Sega Sports could still make NFL games because the NFL 2K series was the best football sim around. I would even rather play an old NFL Gameday (Sony CEA) rather than this overrated pile. Back in 1997, Madden NFL 98 lost in sales to NFL Gameday 98 because it was inferior. The next year EA Sports improved and went back to being the #1 selling NFL game. Then in 1999, Sega Sports released the breakthrough NFL 2K which destroyed Madden NFL 2000 gameplay and graphics wise. EA Sports hasn't made a Madden NFL as good as NFL 2K EVER, although they have always out sold Sega Sports NFL 2K because of better name recognition/marketing. I hope that Electronic Arts exclusive NFL License ends soon in the next few years because Madden needs competition like NFL 2K and NFL Gameday to stay fresh!

Anyway about this game: EA Sports must have lost all inspiration for making a new Madden NFL game every year, because this game simply feels stale. The graphics are clean and smooth for the most part, but the gameplay feels really slow and the controls are stiff and unintuitive. Controls are the worst for kicking field goals/punt/kick offs.

"Besides being a relatively poorly made game that is getting 'meh' reviews from professional reviewers, this game has been ruined by the inclusion of SECUROM.

SUCUROM as I like to call it, is a pretty nasty DRM scheme allegedly designed to stop piracy. It fails miserably at its stated purpose (every EA major release containing DRM in the last 6 months has been cracked immediately). Pirates can and will crack any game produced by EA or any other company.

I'm not endorsing piracy. In fact, I hate piracy and always have. I own zillions of games for consoles and PC, and will happily pay full price for any new game that is worth buying.

However, I won't buy this one.

SECUROM installs with the game. It has some pretty nefarious things that it does aside from failing miserably at preventing piracy:

1. Securom is Spyware. It can and will send information about your computer hardware, installed programs, etc., to EA's authentication servers. I don't remember the US voting to allow EA to have Patriot Act access to my computer.

2. Securom enforces limited activations. That means that this game is really just a rental. If EA ever decides to pull the plug on their servers there is zero guarantee that you will continue to be able to play this game in the future.

3.  Securom is a violation of your consumer rights. Preventing resale by the use of limited activations is a violation of the ""doctrine of first sale,"" (google is your friend) which guarantees my right to transfer ownership of things I buy to anyone else at my discretion. Securom with limited activations makes this an impossibility.

4. Securom is outdated and ineffective. Game makers wiser than EA are beginning to get it and are releasing first rate games absent of DRM. EA is sticking to their doomed business model that will ultimately be their downfall. Spore tanked and sold far, far fewer games than it would have DRM free. DRM free options are getting better and better with smaller game studios realizing that trusting your customers IS A GOOD BUSINESS MODEL.

5. Securom is intentionally VERY hard to uninstall. If you like manually modifying your computer registry on the weekends, it might not be a big deal. For 95% of consumers though, it is a real chore.

SO WHAT CAN YOU AND I DO ABOUT THIS?

The answer is simple: don't buy anything from EA until they get rid of Securom 7x once and for all. I won't be buying this game, or Crysis Warhead, or Dead Space, or any number of other games that I otherwise would because I refuse to let EA treat me like a criminal. I am not a pirate, never will be, nor am I into letting EA (big brother) have root access to my computer. If enough of us choose to spend our money on other games that don't come infested with this DRM crap, maybe just maybe EA will change its ways. And if not, at least we've contributed to independent game makers who understand that we want to pay for great games, but not let them put a DRM ring in our computer's noses.

Here are some great minimal DRM to no DRM games well worth playing:

I started playing on Friday night and by Sunday night I had beat the story and reached level 25. The story was pure insane poop. Short, uninteresting and repetitive... The story basically is a defend ghost (your partner) over and over again. The strikes are long depending on your level to only end up getting nothing when you beat the boss... you would think they would do like every other game in history of mmo style games, a boss means loot right? No trading. Too much farming in order to anything worthwhile... this wouldn't be bad if wasn't for the fact that you do the same five or less things over and over again. Don't take me wrong it is an okay game if you are able to play the game without paying the money it costs... if you have to pay for this be ready for the greatest disappointment of your life.

"There are evil forces in America that will try to sell you anything, and these evil forces understand the public's fascination with sports heroes and celebrities, and so take a sports hero and a video game and shouldn't that be a winning combination? Listen: this game is simply retarded. A basketball player does not a martial artist make. At first glance you might think this game is pretty cool; after all, the graphics are very well done and the animation is very fluid. But when you realize that you have a total of three moves--punch, kick, jump--and that you can defeat any evil kung fu master just by endlessly jump kicking across the screen and bouncing like a pogo stick, you realize this is not going to be a very deep fighting game. But, yeah, the graphics are pretty good so this game doesn't suck as bad as it possibly could. And then you remember that it's about a basketball hero who just happens to be a world-class martial artist, and that that martial artist is none other than Shaquille O'Neil. And you realize that you have too much free time on your hands, and that maybe you're playing this cart because you're really desperate to be entertained, and then you realize you were having more fun with Bimini Run, which you go back to. OK, to be fair, this game isn't nearly as bad as Bimini Run but it's still pretty ridiculous. Recommended only for those who enjoy a nice steaming pile of crap.",1.0
"I've never owned the original Xbox, nor have I previously bought an Xbox 360.

However, I thought that the mere price of $ 199 for a gaming console was a fair deal, even if the stories all over the internet about the Xbox 360's horrible design are true. I ordered an Xbox 360 directly from amazon, and not from another seller.

Before I go into my experiences with the Xbox, I have to mention that I have a PS3 plugged into a HD Computer Monitor, with an HDMI to VGA converter. In fact, that leads me to the Xbox's first flaw: the normal A/V output is directly above the HDMI output, and you cannot use both at the same time, meaning that if I were to play a video game , I would have to play without audio. Fortunately, Microsoft has addressed this issue by selling a VGA HD AV cable...for $ 30! That is absolutely ridiculous! I bought a PS3 HDMI to VGA converter for $ 8!

Secondly, a hard drive is not included with the Arcade version of the Xbox 360! The cheapest model of the PS3 slim comes with 120 GB! Another joke, if I were to buy an Xbox 360 with a hard drive, it would cost me the same as a PS3, which defeats the argument that the Xbox 360 is cheaper.

The Xbox 360 is also far too large and comes with a huge power adapter, another design fail.

The Xbox 360 controller runs with batteries! If you want a way to recharge your controller you need to spend extra!

I've also heard complaints that the Xbox 360 is far too loud.

To play games online with the Xbox 360, you need to pay for an Xbox Live Gold account! Of course, the online experience is faster and smoother than the PS3's, but still, I'd much rather it be free.

Now, I knew all of this before I bought the Xbox 360, and really, I didn't care that much about these flaws. There are some great games exclusively for the Xbox 360, and for me it would have been worth buying if not for one thing that is the absolutely ridiculous...the Red Ring of Death. I didn't even get to play any games on the Xbox 360, the moment I turned it on FOR THE ABSOLUTE FIRST TIME (this is not a refurbished unit), I got the Red Ring of Death, and I am currently waiting for amazon to ship me a new Xbox. But making a console that is so badly designed and engineered that a person who turns on a new Xbox finds that the unit is completely defective and worthless is absolutely inexcusable! Save your money...if you must buy a console buy a PS3, if you already have a PS3, beware that the Xbox 360 features horrible design.",1.0
"In general I enjoy Ratchet and Clank games, so I decided to play all of the games in the series. I was excited to play this game because I heard about all of the different armors and weapons. Darn, I was greatly disappointed. The overall game play and graphics can make your head hurt so be careful with this one. The main thing I don't like about this game is all the different races and Clank Challenges that you have to go through for items. This is primarily what I don't like. Still if you're a Ratchet and Clank fan, like myself, it's worth playing once or twice. I heard some people liked it better on the PSP, so I'll glance at to see if it entices me. Otherwise, I'll probably be selling this game in the near future.",1.0

The game is way to short for starters.  secondly 400 AF Academia is so screwed up plan on spending about 2 hours going from end of level to beginning.  agro range needs fixed in the level.  by time i reached 4th out of 6 episodes in game I had 1 3/4 of Crystorium left to complete.  ??? Archytle Steppe the monsters that you fight for quest after killing Cactuars and opening the Gate are WAY to easy.  4 in total including Ochu which if you remember from FF 13 was one of top 10 hardest to kill.  it took me about 8 total hours of play time for me to reach Episode 6 final episode.  I am not sure if this game is shorter than Kill Zone 2 which was also a bad game.  To me this game is just as bad as Final Fantasy 10-2.  I have played every final fantasy game to date and this is worst or second worst one in the series in my opinion.,1.0

"This is a great game.  I think it's physics and graphics are the best I have ever seen.  However $50 is a lot of money to spend for a game that you really only are leasing for a few years, or if you are unlucky and have your PC repaired a few times replacing hardware you won't be able to run this game anymore.  Thanks to DRM.  And thanks to DRM I won't get to play this awesome game.

I went to purchase for 3 identical systems, mine and my two son's. It is a lot to always drop $150 for each new game that comes out. But I have been doing it for years. (The family that kills together, stays together! :).

Yes, as others have noted, this type of a system don't keep the pirates away, they hacked it already. It keeps the people that pay away.
Heck, if they wanted to look, Amazon keeps records of purchases. Mine go back 8 years. They can see every game I ever purchased,
and always in 3's or 4's. (If I can run a local server so we can play against just the 3 of us, I buy a 4th copy and run a dedicated server).

I also love UBI games and want to support them, but I can't pay for what is a short term lease. There are some old and classic games I still play,
like BF2 and BF1942, Alien vs Predator, Black hawk Down, Serious Sam, Postal 2, Doom 3 (Doom is 1980's! and a classic). This is just the wrong solution to the problem.  I won't use a free hacked version either.  The honest people remain honest.  But this is a great game, and long after this game is no longer drawing in $50, and it is in the bargain bin a while, this is the type of game that will become classic and a copy will sell on ebay used for $150 or more.  DRM long after the support stops for this game will leave me with no one to turn to when I need to upgrade my system yet again, 3 times in the next 6 years...",1.0
"Granted this was a launch title so it's old, but people rave about the graphics, which quite frankly, aren't that great (by today's standards). There is quite of bit of tearing, but no texture pop in. The textures are all kind of washed out, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be the style, or not. They're pretty, but nothing that will knock your socks off. The level design is unimaginative and very linear, often literally so and very repetitive. Boss designs aren't very imaginative and there is little to no variety in enemies. The controls get the job done for the most part, though feel a little clunky sometimes.

There are 4 different play styles, listed in order from least to most suckey:

(1)Main Character: I don't remember her name, she's the hack and slash character (and frankly the only one that should have been playable.) her animations aren't great, but she's fun enough to use to hack through hordes of bad guys, three different sword style you can switch quickly between and blocking is usually automatic as long as you have the same style selected as your enemy. This alone would make the game about worth, at most, about 10 bucks, but sadly, when it deviates from it's hack/slash course it just sucks.

(2)Motion Controls: Sometimes you'll need to pick items, or aim cannon balls at targets, when you shoot/throw you take on the first person perspective of these objects, and control them with the motion control in the controller. If used a little sparingly these sequences could break the game up nicely. I found my motion controls worked fine and these parts were sometimes kind of fun. Unfortunately, these sequences can over stay their welcome and seem to be there to pad out an already short game

(3)QuickTime Events: If you're a fan annoying, random, QuickTime events that go on for too long, and flash too quickly, and when you mess up you start from scratch, then this game has to top your list

(4)Kai:...sigh...Kai, this is the main character's younger sister and takes the game from OK to tedious instantly. She's a playable character who has a wacky...childlike personality. She shoots arrows (so buckle up for awkward Sixaxis encounters with enemies.) Her segments RIP you right out of the action and any enjoyment you may be having. She can't really defend herself, and when you shoot it takes on a first person perspective (during which you can't move) then you have to shoot the approaching or distant enemies. These parts get tedious really quickly, and at times you'll be overwhelmed and die, then have to play the sequence again, which wouldn't be bad if it were fun. These sequences make the game feel like a slog you want to get over with, not a game...OH and this part just adds insult to injury, often you'll be running around with this annoying twerp and you'll go to shoot BAM first person perspective AIMED in the opposite direction, it takes forever for this bitch to slowly rotate to the target, so you're screwed - this happens ALL THE TIME, after five minutes with her you'll hate her more and more every time she say's something child-like. (sometimes as a added bonus treat she gets coupled with QuickTime events which take the game into suck overdrive) These should have been stealth/puzzle missions which could have been fun; controlling arrows to activate switched behind guards, instead it's the wrong play mechanic in an action environment.

Overall, it's cheap, if your curious, I won't change you mind, but I've been bargain slumming lately, and this was one I was hoping would be a forgotten gem, instead it turned out to be...well read the title of this post. This game makes the much superior yet greatly flawed Genshi: Spirit of the Blade feel like Ninja Gaiden.",1.0

Another issue I have is the placement of the on/off and disc open button, and how sensitive they are. And the games included don't even come in cases, even though that's how it was advertised.  I just feel Sony could have done better instead of being so desperate for sales and profitibility.",1.0

We don't let the whole world use it, or copy the disk for others, as other people should buy their own, but everyone in the family should be able to use the family computer and what's on it.  There are some games on the computer, like Plants v. Zombies.  Everyone can take turns playing them, under their own name (so it saves their own progress).  NOT WITH THIS GAME!  Only one person can play this $60 game.  They actually expect you to buy separate copies for each member of your family who wants to play.  That's disgusting.

"This is the worst version of this game available. Well, in fairness, the DS game is probably clunkier, but it does CT the service of not even trying to be the original game. It was its own thing and while I would maintain that the choice to make a full 3D stealth game on a platform as weak as the DS was ill-advised, it's pretty OK for what it is. It doesn't bother me overmuch. I still think they could have made something far better if they adapted it for 2 dimensions, but never mind that.

This abomination, on the other hand, is all of the recognizable elements of Chaos Theory cut up and watered down for the 3DS. As you might have guessed, this really pisses me off. The levels, including the perfectly placed lighthouse opener, have been cut into shorter, simpler sections separated by load zones. Every single texture has been reduced to an indistinguishable smear of its former self. The only thing they couldn't really ruin in the transition was the animations.

The lighting, the SINGLE most important visual element of Splinter Cell, has been completely ruined. The gorgeous, deep black dynamic lighting of the original is now a relatively uniform blanket of uninteresting dimness. Night vision is now what appears to be a blurry white texture applied to enemies. It is completely useless. The only real indicator of concealment is the light meter.

And then there are the controls... Unlike the DS game, which had the decency to employ the less-than-perfect, but reasonably precise touch screen for aiming, now we have the FACE BUTTONS. On top of this, they have replaced the aiming reticle with a much larger and much less useful variation that actually gets in the way. It gets in the way because it immediately becomes massive and red when you are pointing at an enemy. It becomes large enough that it becomes difficult to line up a reliable head shot at even pretty reasonable distances. Awful.

They even remixed the incredible soundtrack by Amon Tobin and, like all of the other modifications, made it worse as result (though perhaps by a lesser margin than the previous elements).

In short: avoid this game like the plague. If you haven't played Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, pick it up for the Original Xbox, PC, or PS3 (listed in order of quality). If you have played it, don't tarnish your memories of that classic by subjecting yourself to this mess. It isn't worth the time or the money. I really wish it was.",1.0

"Honestly, I didn't expect Starcraft II to be the second coming of RTS games, but after playing this game I came to the conclusion that it was ""too little, too late"". While I can certainly understand Blizzard's mission to uphold the highest design standards of the game and not release until ""its ready"", what I came away with was that the game does not justify the long wait we endured. While the CGI sequences are certainly above standard (what game doesn't have great cgi scenes?), there is nothing particularly spellbinding about the gameplay. Been there, done that, was what I kept thinking as I played through the missions. Initially I did not believe the rumors I kept hearing about Starcraft II being a ""third of a game"". But it is true! The game can be finished fairly quickly by any seasoned RTS player.

The OpenID/TrueID thing...this is the appalling part of the entire process. It RUINS the game. It is a slap in the face to anyone who plunked down hard earned money for this game. I have no desire for my real name to be floating out there for the spammers to utilize. I already get enough spam.

"Condemned 2's developers clearly played Manhunt 1 on PC and PS2. This game woefully tries to mimic its mood and storyline but instead provides ugly, muddy graphics and a storyline chock full of expletives for shock value.

I couldn't get pass the first level. The entire game looks like a huge oil slick was dumped on everything. One can barely make out characters or details because of the ugly color scheme and detail given to everything. The story is cheap and stupid - rather than provide an intriguing storyline and main character, the player is given cuss words and a main character that's about as ugly and filthy as his language. The combo system is clunky, frustrating, and pointless. Hell, the main character should be able to curse everyone out and just walk off. That's how the fight system should've been. Choose the best cuss word and watch what happens.

It's a stupid game developed by stupid people that knew they could cash in easily with the use of strong language that (mostly kids, wink wink) would be shocked at. I'm sure they were pissed with the M+17 rating as this game clearly was not targeting an intelligent, 20yr old+ audience.

"Jim Sterling from Destructoid called this game a pompous and masturbatory affair, creating seemingly to promote the developers ego first, and the players enjoyment second. Speaking as someone who has been a rabid fan of the series since the very first one on the NES, Ill say two things: Jim is exactly right, and playing this game broke my heart.

The one and only positive I can give FF13 is that it has gorgeous visuals. Thats what the 2-score in my review is for. It fails in every other category so badly that it feels like some other company trying to make a knock-off FF game (think Sonys Legend of Dragoon for PS1) rather than an officially sactioned entry into the series. It doesnt deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as classics like IV, VI, VII, or X. Its unbelievable that Squeenix is granting an unprecedented two sequels to this game while utterly ignoring, for years on end, pleas from their fans to do a modern-day remake of 7, 6 or even 5.

Why is it so bad? Let me count the ways. First of all, the story is weird & stupid. I stopped caring about it early on and didn't like any of the characters. Secondly, there is practically no exploration. Almost the entire game is a brutally linear affair, and I mean that quite literally as areas tend to shuffle you through a completely straight path. No exploring towns, no buying weapons from the weapon shop, no hidden dungeon areas with secret chests, etc. Things finally open up at one point, but not for 30 or 40 hours or so and even then, its a relatively small environment that is boring to travel through. The music, usually a dependable staple of the series, is terrible as well. I mean, they put words in the chocobo song. Good grief, why? There isn't a single memorable track.

Gameplay is terrible, as well. Theres not a whole lot of thinking involved and it almost plays itself. The summoning system is truly bizarre (I did a facepalm when I saw the Shiva motorcycle; seriously, WTF is that about?) and the worst the series has ever seen. I played this game for a good, long while, about 75% through, before giving up on it in disgust. To give you some idea of how bad this game is, I didn't care much at all for the story of FF12, either, but I still had fun with it. FF13 never gave me a moment of enjoyment.

"This isn't a Silent Hill game. Everything that made the original's(1-4) great i.e. 1. Original, meaningful monsters. 2. Great atmosphere. 3. Survival horror. 4. Good story. And 5. Horror! Just aren't here.
Most of the monster's are reused from Silent Hill 2. They were supposed to be based on James own person demons. So it didn't make any sense and was just lazy to have them in Homecoming. Only the boss fights had any meaning. But most of the game your fighting James's demons.
The atmosphere is too dark and dull. It seems like they where trying to make the game scarier by making it so dark that you can't see but it doesn't work.
This game is way to combat-oriented for a survival horror game. It has this awful up and close combat system that wants you to fight almost every enemy. The older game wanted you to try to escape the enemy's. This one you can't even run! This isn't a survival horror game, its a really bad action horror game.
The story tries to hard to be like the movie. In the original most of the cult members were dead. It makes no sense for them to be alive, why would Silent Hill let the other cult live?
Almost all the scares are predictable jump scares.
The only good thing I can say about this game is the soundtrack is amazing, and there were a few good boss fights.

"I bought this controller a few days ago and just had to take another trip back to return it. When I hooked it up with the PS3, it worked fine on the menu of the PS3. However, when i started a Playstation 2 game, it wouldn't recongnize the controller no matter what USB port i put it in. So i tried switching to another game, same problem. It wouldn't recognize the controller as even being hooked up to the station on a game. If that's not bad enough, the instructions were no help whatsoever. -4 stars, what good is a controller if it doensn't even work? And a 40 dollar paperweight is all it would be for all of us who still have PS2 games. Now i'm a big fan of Logitech controllers, i was completely impressed with their PS2 controllers, wonderful, they lasted for several years. But honestly, Logitech was a real dissapointment here with this controller. It looks like they rushed it out to try to get ahead in controller production. The controller lacked several things that is neccesary to a PS3 controller. A code of numbered lights on the controller to tell you what number it is paired in, I personally, don't want to spend the afternoon calculating the seemingly random number of blinks on the USB adapter to figure out where the controller is paired. Second, as someone also mentioned, No sixaxis control. I think it still has the vibrators in there instead. Third, no bluetooth. A USB adapter will take up precious space and if that's all you used, you could only get 4 people to play on your PS3 instead of being able to get more pairing with the Sony controllers. Overall, it's a big dissapointement. Spend the extra $10 and get a standard Sony controller, it's better than sending it back to wherever you bought it from.",1.0

"I don't regard products like this as games. Games are fun. As I see it, this is a torture device posing as a game. I would have enjoyed it if there had been an optional difficulty level tailored to my admittedly average reflexes, but I'm not interested in spending hundreds of hours becoming more and more frustrated when what I need from a game is enjoyment. It's a bad game that only caters to folks who spend way too much time honing their reflexes to almost superhuman levels. I have a life - I don't have time for this nonsense.

Sorry, fans, but I'm just tired of developers ignoring folks like me when it comes to top tier titles. I want to play too, but apparently Bandai isn't interested in opening up their game to a wider audience by including options for those of us who aren't interested in (and just don't have time for) a challenge of this magnitude. After all, it's not as if the elite gamers would be forced to play the game on easy difficulty - they could still go for their challenge all they want.

The challenge and the sense of achievement that some say this game gives are just not worth the aggravation for me: it's just a game and beating it is not that important. I have better things to do with my time.",1.0

"Yet again Suda 61 makes a game that has more flash than substance -- Killer 7, Halo 2, No More heroes, Final Fantasy 7, and now this game. Get it together, Suda. His Fire Pro Wrestling games were amazing.. but that was like, 30 years ago. Now we have this horrible game with little to no storyline(LOL REVENGE) and immature humor. What baffles me most, is the M rating on the box.. I mean, really? This is a children's game. The large amount of sexual references made me question if this game was related to Bayonetta in anyway. Aside from the sexual references mentioned above and the blood.. No More heroes 3 is a mindless button masher for children.

Also, theres a'little TOO much ""humor"" for such a violent movie game. Travis seems like a normal(IN JAPAN) guy most of the time, but during some parts of the game(mainly cutscenes) he turns into a ruthless jackass and even kills some innocent people with no remorse, even cracking a joke while doing so; way to be inconsistent, speaking of inconsistency.. theres appearantly 50 assassins, but Marella doesn't recall fighting that many, the game blatantly lies to you.

Marella praises the game's charater designs, but the gameplay is far too linear in this era of gaming.. that's weak. It doesn't take much effort to make a game that parody's other games and has a non-existant un-original plot.. anyone could do this. The only good thing about this game, aside from the character designs, would be the MGS and Super Robots homage.

This is why Suda games don't have sequels(with the exception of this one), because they suck.

Marella gives this game a solid, a SOLID, 1/5.

It could have been right up there with Silent Hill, but instead the realism, and thus the intensity and scary factor, is lessened because of the lack of a Japanese audio track, which could have been easily included since this game was released in Japan with such an audio track. Those responsible for releasing this in America must have made a major mental lapse -- I hope so, because if they actually sat down and thought of some ""reasons"" to not include the original language track, then there's simply no excuse, no justification.

It is an interesting idea, but it doesn't really enhance the games. Just because the controller shakes in your hands doesn't mean you feel like part of the game. In fact, with all the shaking, it might even disrupt your game play. You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot, at least that enhances your gaming experience.

FFX had a definite ending, and realistically it was about one thing, a tragic romance.  When FFX-2 was announced, I think it was obvious how it would turn out, and it does turn out that way.  I was a bit surprised that the developers of the game where this predictable.  I kept telling myself, something else has to happen, it can't turn out like a Disney fairytale, but deep down inside I think I knew it.

"Sorry for being a stick in the mud but if I had seen this game running before I got it I probably would have just watched someone else play it. The big con to this game (that I was really looking forward to playing) is the fixed world camera with a tiny little tilt to the left or right that springs back the moment you release the key. Zooming in or out takes you somewhat closer to the fights but you cannot choose your action viewpoint meaning that TBFME is a very limited RTS ( I knew it was limited but didn't realize how much)... so much so, that it is nothing more than draw a big box around whatever group is present on the screen and right click on the enemy and then watch the battle

... but watch what? Amazing 2D fight sequences?... and I think you might just get my point here... -> The film is the better 2D fight sequences.

I am sorry but the fact that you could not rotate the camera just blew me away. It felt like playing R-Type Final or some other 2D platform shoot `em up. The extreme (and I mean extreme) lack of critical thinking in this game just makes it a very glorious looking bad game. It is not even a game when compared to any modern RTS. The best way of describing it is like a gawk-fest where you can literally sit back and just let the game run itself. I would not have minded that if I could actually choose an angle to gawk at the battles.

The best way of describing my disappointment is to imagine if the producers of this thing just recorded a demo of the whole game on DVD for you to watch.

Anyhow, all this depends on how much time you invest in games. If you are a fan of the movie, and do not play games, then maybe this will satisfy you. If you have any experience with RTS gaming and a pimpin' fast computer you have a right to know that you can not rotate or tilt the world. If I knew that then maybe this item would have got a far better rating.

I would love to have recommended it but sadly, I am a gamer and felt badly letdown by the lack of world controls. Something as simple as a 360 rotate with a 90-degree tilt would have made it five stars (even with the simplest of RTS controls). As I said, watching the film is better.",1.0

An example of gameplay:
Open a door and there are mobsters to kill; kill them.  Then go around a corner...same thing. Over & over again. I thought it was boring, and I stopped playing after an hour or so.

"I waited a long time to write a review for this game. I am a long time 2K fan, but what I really liked is when they started the my career mode. I have found a lot that I really don't like. Keep in mind I am only reviewing the my career section of the game.

Let me start with what everyone is complaining about. The VC! This game has turned into a money grabbing nightmare. Just the micro transactions alone ruin the game in my opinion. Sure you can earn it through play, but it takes a long time and you just don't make enough from game to game to make it worth it spending on anything besides player attributes.

Over emphasis on signature skills. This one is really agitating. I had an athletic center, 7th 2inchs, max vertical, and maxed out blocking and struggle to average 1 block a game. Add eraser and chase down artist and suddenly I was averaging 5.6 blocks a game. To me this is bs. They should place more emphasis on the players timing than making them use a ton of VC to get something that just makes their character react how he should in the first place being he's in the NBA. If this was high school basketball, okay cool.

That leads into a whole other problem. How terrible they start your career player at. You can't make a layup,  run down the court, dunk at 7ft 2in or pass, dribble or rebound. You are useless and belong at a grocery store, not on a basketball court. That coupled with the horrible attempt at a story line that also ruins the experience in and of itself. No words can express how miserable it is. You feel like you playing someone else's save with the stupid junk your player does and says.

Next we have position bias. Yes, if you are a center or a power forward,  you are automatically and are huge disadvantage. Both post positions are automatically cut out in the opening cut scene where your character is clearly a guard. Unfortunately that cut scene is what the rest of the game is like. Your 7ft 2 center will, post up for threes instead of roll to the basket on a pic and roll, spin layup, refuse to dunk under the basket. Miss post shots, but somehow knockdown jumpers? Furthermore, guards will out rebound you. My center was on the Timberwolves,  Rubio would out rebound me nearly every time we went head to head. This was also true with,  Tony Parker,  derrick rose, rajon rondo, jru holiday, and Daron Williams to name a few. In fact my center only averaged 6 rebounds a game! That's even with all the stats maxed out and all the signature skills for rebounding. So I made a 7ft small forward with the same signature skills as a test. Sure enough,  I know average 10 rebounds and 4 blocks (block stat maxed ar 75!) a game. I out rebound other centers and power forwards. This is really sad, being the small forwards rebound and block stats max out way lower than the centers do. It's obvious this game was made for people who wanted to be sf/sg/pg positions.

Lastly, the lack of actual basketball in the game. The AI for team mates is abysmal. There is no give and go, no pick and roll (your player actually freezes until the defender gets back on you), they never allyoop you or get you shots you can actually take. They throw you the ball and you are on your own. No one makes cuts, no one sets picks. It's obviously set up for someone to waltz down the lane and make lay up, or even more likely,  launch 3s.

With two factors that alone make this a one star, the VC/Micro transactions and the horrible attempt at a story line make this such a let down. If you like the simulation aspects to this game series, you'll be satisfied. Apart from 5 min  quarters scoring ending in full length basketball game.",1.0

Activision's greedy influence is very clear. There will be SO MUCH DLC planets, weapons, level increases, gear etc...no wonder the developer kept saying this will be 'supported'  for a long time and that not to trust 'first day reviews' .I mean I know I am sounding harsh but you have to play it to believe this. The 'story' which is ridiculously bad can be beaten in 5-6 hours and even then they were not fun, just same repetitive missions over and over. And once you reach the level 20...it's over there is nothing else to do. Not even getting better gear is worth it because the game balances pvp fights so you are never have the edge. I don't really know where the massive budget went. Oh wait I know...99% for marketing and 1% for the game content. I don't have much else to say to be honest. This game is a joke, not because it's bad but because there is barely a game in there, especially when you compare it to a game like Borderlands. I highly suggest you don't fall to the hype like I did. Stay away from this.",1.0
"I just threw $30 away buying the highly broken, freeze-prone PC version which has NO UNINSTALLER and is simply unplayable. NBA 2k14 for PC is intolerably stupid. First, it takes an hour just to get into the game due to the new player account creation and apparently non-responsive 2K servers. Second, even after creating an account (which, I have to wonder, why that's even necessary?) it will get stuck on the login screen (after waiting 30 minutes, had to Ctrl+Alt+Del to escape and kill the process!!). Third, there is NO UNINSTALLER!!!! When you insert the disc, it immediately starts running the game. There is no uninstaller in the Program Files or in Control Panel. Un-freaking-believable. And here I thought, shoot, why not give the PC version a try instead of the Xbox for a change?

My son has played NBA 2k for the last few years and loves the game on XB360. This time around, I decided to give the PC version a try so he could enjoy his new PC, and to take a break from the XB360. BIG MISTAKE. It was an unpleasant experience from the moment the disc was inserted. Which, by the way, only works once. After you run the installer the first time, it will never, ever, ever come up again. You can only go into Control Panel to the Uninstall list, and Redo the install, there is absolutely no way to get rid of this game off your PC without manually editing the registry and deleting the files physically (which I'm averse to do). This is absolutely unacceptable.

Why did we need to uninstall it? Because it freezes up at the player login screen, no reply, no interrupt, no option to exit. Have these developers ever heard of a user interface? Do they realize that a game shouldn't just go into an endless loop when looking for a server, without allowing the user to cancel? I would venture to guess that the ""physical disc version"" is a mostly broken hack of the Steam version.

I thought this was the Steam version, was expecting a Steam code inside. Apparently there is more than one ""PC version"" of the game, as if that makes any sense. At least the Steam version would be able to uninstall the game easily and re-install it if desired. This physical disc non-Steam game is absolutely broken. Amazon owes me a Steam code and I don't know how I'm going to get rid of this off my son's PC in order to install the Steam version. This sort of experience was supposed to be the heyday of PC gaming, not 2013. I assume the Steam version can be installed/re-installed/uninstalled like any Steam game. The standalone PC version, though, is a total bust.

[EDIT 11/25/13] Amazon gave me a refund with a restocking fee applied and I have to spend about $3.00 to send it back. So I only threw away about $10.00, but it's better than $30. Will apply that toward the XB360 version.",1.0

"This is the very last time I will ever purchase a Playstation port over to the PC.  If software is developed for the Playstation, it is quite simply made to be played on the Playstation.  Everything about this port over is just absurd garbage from the first intro frame.  One, the screen is awkward.  Two, the game will just randomly crash while on Windows.  However, thirdly and worst of all THE GAME CONTROLS LIE TO YOU ON SCREEN.  If you are familiar with any of the games in this series, there are moments when you will have to randomly press a sequence of buttons when prompted on screen.  HOWEVER, in this weak and absurd port over, the on screen signals HAVE NO RELATION TO ANY ACTUAL KEYBOARD OR CONTROL FUNCTION.  Instead of saying, for example, ""ENTER KEY!""  or something simple like that, the pc version will spam ""3!!""  or  ""1 + 2!!""  and the numeric keys on your keyboard actually have nothing to do with the actual controls that you need to use.  Turns out that ""1"" actually means the enter key... such lies at such critical moments are simply intolerable.  Keep in mind that it will randomly generate a set of controls so you'll have to translate and/or figure out what the game actually means instead of simply PLAYING the game.

"If you are like me, a father just trying to make his child happy, DO NOT BUY THIS!

First, there are no Childrens titles for the 360.  Maybe in a few years there will be some.

Second, this console IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE with most games.  Check the Microsoft site and they will confirm this (about 15 levels deep into the X-Box site).  However, no where in the XBox manual do they tell you this.

Third, Toys R Us will sell you Xbox games(not 360) and claim they will work with the new X-Box.  They simply do not!  In the rare case they do work, you must first download and install a software patch!  DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE!!

Finally, the XBox 360 is a decent DVD player and has great graphics for those with HDTV and the hookups (MS supplies the component cables).

"Are you a working person who likes to play a game every now and then?  Any game from Blizzard is NOT FOR YOU.  UPDATES!  Everytime I load the game I have to wait a half hour for updates!!

But when I finally find a little time to sit down and play, nope, I have to wait for updates. I can't play this game!  I'm too busy!  Oh, you can't play the game offline, don't be fooled by what it says on their website.  It's bull.

Okay the first thing i noticed with this game is there is hardly any lighting effect even when i adjusted it. the tank you first encounter looks like its made out of card board from what i could see of it. (due to lighting.) The AI is retarded most of the enemys run into walls. and keep running. the first medal of honor for playstation 1 is better than this peice of garbage. and the american M1 garand your allies have is semi automatic but they work it like a bolt action rifle. thats what the Germans use. And thats if your lucky to even get them to shoot back at the enemy. The last thing i noticed was the phisycs are broken. I shot this german and he floats into the air and disapeers WTF! and my friend who also played this game experianced the same thing. and this was a brand new game i didn't rent it. i bought it from walmart. and after that i sold it to gamestop for 20$. If you still want to play this pitiful excuse for a game rent it don't buy it. either way in my oppinion its not even worth your time or money for that matter.,1.0
"After WWE 2K14 came out I was impressed with the features it had. My thought was that the next game can only get better. I actually went as far to preorder the Xbox 360 version because I was excited about it. Needless to say, I'm regretting that decision. This year's game is nothing more than a stripped down carbon copy of last year's game. With an emphasis on the ""stripped down"".

Most of the features in this game are identical except for the things they removed. I love to create wrestlers in this game. All of my created wrestlers have created moves & I almost always use custom theme music. For whatever reason 2K decided to remove it. THAT SUCKS! The creative features is what I have loved about the WWE games. To make it even worse, they removed many of the entrance motions that they had in the previous game. WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE at 2K!!??

If you liked the nostalgic factor that WWE 2K14 had, you won't find it here. There are a few classic wrestlers like Ultimate Warrior, Stone Cold Steve Austin, & Sting is a DLC. However, you aren't going to find loads of classic wrestlers that they had in the last game.

I also am not crazy about the 2K Showcase. It only feature two rivalries. One of them is between John Cena & CM Punk & the other is between Shawn Michaels & Triple H. Why not expand beyond that to include other famous rivalries?

I think it is interesting that they included some of the NXT Roster, but the Got NXT mode is hardly enough to keep my interest. It's very similar to the 2K Showcase where it focuses on various NXT wrestlers.

Most of the features that they left in the game is very much like the previous game. If you really have to get this game, whatever you do, wait until the price drops. Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't pay full price for this game. It's not worth it. If 2K comes out with another WWE game next year, I'm going to be extremely cautious before buying it.",1.0
"1) I purchased this with standard shipping speed, it was late. But that didn't matter to me. When it had first arrived, I opened the package (which didn't offer much protection for the product itself) and took out the 4-Port USB. The only port that works is the one on the bottom left labeled ""USB 1"". None of the others work.
2) A problem I have with it is that it doesn't properly fit into my PlayStation 3 console. That could explain why only one USB port works.
3) When I use my one port available to charge my controller, it is incredibly slow. It took an hour to charge my controller to the second bar.
I'm just going to throw this thing away. I suggest that you do not purchase this product. It's not even worth ninety-nine cents.",1.0
"Although I didn't find this outing nearly as infuriating as the original white ""METAL GEAR SOLID"" for PS1 (since it's much more user-friendly:  you can pause most cutscenes, save where you want, etc.), I still had several problems with it.

1.  This really isn't a game so much as a movie where you're occasionally allowed to push buttons. The cutscenes and other mandatory dialogue take up so much time that there's little time left for your playing. Whenever you do play, it feels like the only point of doing so is to get to the next ""briefing.""

2.  Your character, for all his arcane military prowess, seems unable to climb over the hood of a normal car or climb a 4-foot-high pile of rubble. It doesn't go over well, especially if you're watching someone else play the game.

3.  Sneaking around on the battlefield? Brother.  Sneaking around in the FOX headquarters may have been one thing, but I wasn't buying this for a second.

4.  The boss monsters are boring and repetitive.

5.  Unarmed combat was idiotic:  there's no aiming system.  it'll have you kicking a bookshelf whilst your mortal enemy stands by looking at you.

6.  The game won't let you use your weapons in certain sequences merely because doing so would make the sequence too easy to beat.

7  I wish the game would stop making me crouch by default!  I can't count how many times that's messed me up.

8.  Warning:  in this game, smoke stops bullets.

9.  With the original Metal Gear Solid, Konami stumbled upon something profound in video games:  stealth is fun!  But they seem to have lost sight of that with this outing:  here, stealth is a lot less important.  In fact, it's most efficient to simply run through every scenario, which you'll discover before long.

10.  The plot was absurdly convoluted.  Did we really need all those details?  Yeah, we get it.  Naomi is a spy.  We have to kill so-and-so.  We have to retrieve this or that package.  Fine.  Can we play now?  Do we really need all those extra names and dates?  You'll notice that if you simply skip all that, it doesn't make a fig of difference to your enjoyment.

11.  I found the biggest problem was that this game didn't have much zazz, much sizzle. With other video games, I find myself playing them compulsively every day until I finish them. With this one, I found myself able to leave it for a week or two before coming back to it: this should be accounted a defect.

In sum, this could have been fun but was just confusing.  There were a good mix of challenges, though.",1.0
"Unless you're buying this for PlayStation NOW and have a wired internet connection just steer clear of this thing. This has been out for nearly 18 months, as of right now it will not play most of the PSP or PS Vita collection. There is no Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube app that works (You can download them, but it says ""This application is not compatible..."" when you try to use it, and Netflix won't play in the browser, either). You cannot ""cast"" to it, like a Chromecast or AppleTV, and finally the PS3 remote play (which includes playing PS1 titles, and exists on the PSVita) is not there. The PS4 remote play is patchy, but wireless connectivity in Sony devices (PSVita, PSTV, PS4, PS3, and PSP) has never been all that fantastic. If the devices are reasonably close and the space is not obstructed the wireless remote play works fine, otherwise, you will want to have the PSTV and PS4 on an Ethernet cable.

"This game is more about an Auction House than playing a game. Loot is rare, I mean scarcely rare, and so randomized you could play, like me, hundreds of hours and get nothing good for your character. BUT, you can take all your gold and try to find an over priced upgrade on the Auction House, a place where you will compete with hundreds of auction house farmers that sit lurking for reasonably listed items they can buy instantly to relist for a 100x markup... Oh, you could do this too of course, if you don't mind drudging through a spreadsheet seeking items to buy and resell... Sound like fun? Of course, while doing this you won't actually be playing the game... or leveling your character... or progressing. If you buy D3 know you will be buying a 60 dollar auction house run by a bunch of mean spirited monsters preventing you from affording even a single upgrade... They even have a nickname for their little style of play, Diablo Tycoon.

However, the first play through is good. You might buy it and, like me, think it's a great game. Play 400 hours and see if you feel the same way!

I heard someone call this game PvAH, that's, Player vs. Auction House, and let me tell you, that's all this game is, A giant Auction House. And as a player you will be forced to use the auction house if you want to progress, because loot you can use is about as common as finding hundred dollar bills laying on the ground.

Lastly, the game shipped with exploits and dupes and gosh knows how many economy breaking bugs... The company is more focused on nerfing characters abilities and spots in the game that are player friendly than doing anything for characters who are struggling... Because, you see, in their opinion, you can just use the auction house and be well geared, if you just have a good 100 million gold... in 400 hours of playing across multiple 60's I have made a grand total of 20m gold... that's not even enough to buy an upgrade on the Auction House anymore, lol.

If you buy, it's your dime, but don't say you weren't warned.",1.0
"I like the books. At least the early books, and I'm an avid video gamer so when I saw they had a Left behind game, I decided to give it a whirl. First of all, even though my PC is up to spec, the game has REALLY long load times. The tutorial was beastly, the interface awkward. The units (people), look too similar, and have specific assigned genders (such as no female soldiers, etc.) Halfway through the monstrously long and unweildy tutorial I gave up. The graphics and the clunky iterface just didn't do it for me.

I think this series would make a better adventure game... You know with puzzles and traveling to exotic locations (like those produced by DreamCatcher) The LB universe is so interesting it would really shine in that kind of environment. Particularly if characters could visit places such as Jerusalem, New Babylon, and Tribulation force HQ.

"The game, from a Christian standpoint, isn't very good. If you're not a Christian or a parent trying to make sure that your kids don't get a hold of a bad game, then chances are, you won't like this review. But if you are one of the two, please continue reading.
First off, the reason I bought this game is because I had previously owned the second of these unleashed force games. The second is great, the only problem was that it is a bit short. Doesn't last long unless you play it through twice. It received a lot of negative reviews, but it honestly was very good. I'd recommend it highly. It's a fun game. However, the first of these games has way too much provocative clothing. One of the characters, Maris Brood, it actually partially naked in the game. I know that the game isn't rated for that, but it's true. The second game wasn't rated for language, but yet it had it, although only a couple words through the entire game. Yah, I knew that there would be a little bit of this revealing clothing when I bought the game, but I didn't know that it would be so bad. It really is worse than you'd think. Skip this game and buy the second. The second one it just as good, but has much less of the provocative clothing. Hope this helps.",1.0

Do not buy these controllers. They are useless. The Dpad doesn't work at all on these. If you push left your character will also move up or down. Same goes for right. I also can't recommend the Gtron controllers either. They are just as bad. All the four and five star reviews are from people who wright reviews after using these controllers for an hour or so.

"Buyers, be careful. I had Xbox One for a year and enjoyed it...however, there is an issue recently that you may want to know. My Xbox One worked 100% fine on 02/19/16. On 02/02/16 I downloaded a game from XBox Marketplace (CoD: BO3). After downloading the game, it refused to open. Then, all my digital purchased games on Xbox ceased working (My disks work fine). I contacted Microsoft support, and spent approx 6 hrs troubleshooting. It ended with ""We don't have a solution, sorry. Looks like the marketplace download broke your console. AT least you can use disks right? Tough luck on the digital downloads you paid for and can't access anymore"". Then they asked for 130 bucks for me to pay them to fix my Xbox, after their service caused the issues. This seems like being a car repair shop, changing my oil, dropping something into my engine while performing their service, then blaming me for it and demanding I pay so they can repair it.

I like how fast he is in the games. Plus,he's ability let  You turn into one of your pokemon. Samortout is cool too. Hydragon is a complete beast,with a bunch of powerful moves.

Pokemon with good appearances like Liperd sucks.(some Leopard cat). Anyways,pokemon with uglier looks like Alazakam could destroy most 5th gen pokemon with Zap Canyon,Psychic,Foucus Blast,and ThunderBolt!!!!

Even Team Rocket is more serious!!!! They killed pokemon!!!!

This is the worst pokemon game ever created!!!! Hopefully,the newer generations will be better then 5th generation. Nintendo was just running out of ideas. Black 2 ans White 2 are much better. They added older pokemon. Oh,forgot to mention,Black and White only have new pokemon. The squeals have pokemon from all the gens. Plus,the new Team Plasma is better. Plus,a new torrement where you can battle older gym leaders,New cities,more legendary pokemon,a pokemon moive company,even New gym leaders and a new champion.

"Giving 1 stars because the product won't work. At first it installed drivers automatically every-time between switching from my Laptop to my Desktop, with no issues. Then out of nowhere the mouse began to not work properly on both computers. It won't register in my computer, yet my other mice do. The lights turn on to indicate the mouse is obviously on, the official E-Blue drivers installed.

I bought a good E-Blue Mazer before, both wired and wireless, but this one just broke after barely a month of use. I did not use it all the time, the mice i have used a lot more still work. Even my one year old Logitech mouse i use at work still works.

To make matters worse, the lights really sucked, but i ignored it for i spent most of the time without the lights on. Additionally, the side buttons (Mouse buttons 5 & 6) stopped working after a month of use. But I cannot return the product because the return ""window"" passed which is irrelevant especially considering these products are supposed to be made to last at least a year.

Still, i love the feel and the way the mouse is designed to fit in the palm of your hand. Additionally, i love how easy it is to use the official E-Blue drivers for several of their mice. Additionally, i love how easy it was to switch between DPI settings.

I'm not saying all Mazer or E-Blue mice will fail in less than a month, at least for now, but this mouse was clearly defective since after only about a month of use it stopped working.

If you are wanting to get a Mazer mouse i'd rather you get a Wired one. But at this point i'd rather you stay away from this brand just in case my other Mazer mice fail in less than a year. If it is on sale get it, otherwise keep looking.",1.0

"haha

this one of the sillyest games ever atm...i have played this game fopr 624 days..and knew most of the high rollers and veterans on the Infinity server and even soem on The American Bria server.

After the the several socalled Upgrades..the game was dumbed down so children of the age 7-12 would not gind it as hard to play.

The game many older veteran players..but they sort of left when SOE ( sony online entertainment ) lied to ALL off their players.

We was all waiting for a Upgrade to our different professions, but suddelny out of the blue it was all changed and all the HARD professions was taken out of the game...and Jedi was made a start profession instead of a profession you would be rewarded with after time,they did this just because so many young players wanted to be a jedi after the new movies Ep. 1-3 was released !

they also made jedi rather crap, it cant even be compared to what it was.

So they said one thing but did another without telling their players...how great is that.

The NGE ( new game enhancements ) was not very enhanced at all..they made the game ready to be released to Xbox, made the combat style more crap (and easier for children ) and they lied and keep on lieing.

players bought the new expansion Rage of the wookies thinking it would be fun to play just to find that theit professions was deleted from the game AFTER they bought the expansion..hows that for custumer relations!?!?

SOE should be ashamed, they have NO ! respect for their own player base ! :(

I had a guild with 120 ppl all hardcore players, i had a town with 200 ppl and my friendslist had Soooo many people in it...before i left a few days ago..there was 5 ppl i knew online.

and when i stand around wondering what to do..i keep on getting /tells from young players asking for money ( credits ) as they don't bother to Quest for cash and when you say no..you get alot of Bad language in return.

And ofcourse the lack of content in the game is amazing...you NEED the expansions to get xp after level 30 now...:(

and when they say they added 10 level more to they game ( to level 90 ) thats just silly, cause the first 10 levels are just crap levels should be -10 to 80 instead..

i would Suggest: World Of Warcraft, Guild wars Dungeons and dragons or wait for Middle earth online !

"Ok I bought this for one reason and that is to use my redoctane dance mat on my PC. I am happy to say my dance mat works 100% with this device. I have a 64 bit windows 7 PC. Also my wireless logitech controller works perfectly

So why did I only give it 2 stars if it works perfectly with my mat and wireless controller?
Well it doesn't work with my sony PS2 controllers. I have four sony PS2 controllers and none work fully with this device. I have one controller that came with my slim PS2, two controllers that came with my fat ps2, and one controller that I bought and none of them work fully. The R1 and R2 are not recognized at all and the up directional pad doesn't work on two of the controllers.

Also there is major problem with the drivers. The company that made this doesn't exist anymore. So there really aren't any drivers specifically made for anything beyond windows XP. If you want to find the latest drivers do a google search for dilong 203 drivers but don't use them. Basically I found a guy on stepmania web site that had the drivers up on file hosting site. What happen after installing these drivers was all my fonts got messed up. I'm guessing the drivers were for a Chinese OS. Basically I couldn't read anything on my PC. All texts under my incons were foreign symbols. All text in all texts were foreign symbols. I had to pull out my nexus 7 to search the web for a fix. Basically I ended up using my windows 7 install disc to repair my pc. If you have a system that had windows pre installed and don't have win7 disc you would be in horrible trouble if you didn't make a backup or rescue disc. Before I found a fix I was getting ready to reinstall windows 7.

Now there may be english drivers that won't mess up your pc but it isn't worth the risk looking for them if you ask me. Anyway the basic drivers that come on the disc will let you use a wireless logitech PS2 controller and a redoctane dance mat.  I also tried a guitar that almost worked fully. The only thing that didn't work was the whammy bar.

So if you buy this for mat or wireless ps2 controller make sure to backup the drivers on the disc.  Personally I think you might be better off getting one that is known to work with windows 7 and one that is made by a company that is still in business.

Also note i did try restarting my computer and installing the drivers in windows xp compatibility mode to get the ps2 controllers to work. No dice.

"I really did give it a shot, but it's too boring. I love previous FF games, especially 6, 4, 7, and 1. Like modern FFs, it seems obsessed with Western influence instead of Japanese influence. DQ should be really boring but it still fun. This game feels like FF2, 3 where there's no plot at all. Also, the character designs look like the remake of FF3 - really bland and pastel. Like some 2000s anime. Where's the cool sprites of Kazuko Shibuya? Also the music is really really bland. Where's Nobou?

You can do brave and default in battle, but really default is just a slightly more useful Defend command which has existed for years. Brave is just taking extra turns, but you either do so to beat an enemy quickly or you get beat. Also, paying for things with real money, even if optional, is a disgusting trend. I think it's time to just go back to the old games and replay them.

"Do you know what a SNAFU is? It means that everything is fine one moment, and the next everything is messed up, or in other words Situation Normal All Fudged Up. So I bought these cables and they worked fine; the picture was better and everything that I said it was and everthing was fine. Then I tried to move the system and I had to take the cable out. Now I remember it being a tight fit going in, but some cables are just like that, but getting them out was ridiculous. I tried to be gentle but it just split in half leaving the connector in my system and the casing in my hand. Not cool. I took some needle nose pliers to get them out, and taped the casing together around the connector. It worked once more and I was willing to just accept that. I was then having trouble with my DC and had to take them out again, same thing happened. Now they don't work at all. Now I immagine this is just this off brand that has the issue so I you could get a pair of official cables that would be the best. I would buy another set but I think I would have the same problem.

My reccomendation now is to get the VGA box. Yes, it is more exepensive and combersome, but for the extra $15 is costs (as long as you have the cables) you can get all of your video options in one place. Many people have a VGA option on their HD sets anymore and even if you're just using the S Video option it's nice to have everything there.

Do not buy these cables unless you can get an official set. These are ""inovation"" brand and they are junk. Trust the video review, I should have. Get the VGA box with A/V jacks, you'll be happy you did.",1.0

Sure there are homing missiles here and there but I think this game is better left as a distant memory of how fun it was on PS1. I have fond memories of playing this on PS1 and playing with every character storyline, no doubt by today's standards in the late 90's I would've received a platinum trophy for my achievements but sadly this game also shadows how far we have come in modern gaming.

"As a bargain game I would have thought a Resident Evil title would have been an amazing find for the price.  Wow was I wrong.  I played RE2 way back on the PS1 and found it entertaining.  I am not a huge 3rd person action/survival/horror gamer but I can get my way around most of them.  RE5 is the first game I have turned off after literally less than 30 minutes.  I got about 2 checkpoints into the game before I shut it down before losing my mind.  It's going right back to the store for credit.

I found nothing fun about the control schemes.  Looking over the shoulder is an odd perspective I could get used to if the game was intuitive.  Your character is slow.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.  He walks slow, runs slow, aims slow, and apparently every little item on the floor prevents him from moving.  Imagine a small 13 gallon plastic garbage can stopping the Terminator in it's tracks.  The camera over the right shoulder also makes you completely blind in most instances.  It's a major blindspot.  This would have worked in the slow limited environments of RE1 and 2, it has no place in this type of game.

Very early in the opening stages the game throws you into a massive battle with dozens of zombies and some mad boss from the new movie.  I gave this spot a try a few times before giving up.

  The zombies no longer lumber around.  They are fast and plentiful.  With no auto-target you have to manually aim at each one.  This is infuriating for so many reasons.  A.  You are completely blind on your left.  It's as if Chris has only one eye.  B.  The aiming mechanism is so incredibly slow to move around.  By the time you get your target selected its on you.  C.  Your partner is secretly trying to kill you.  She shoots your target causing you to waste ammo and she gets in your way at every step.  She also needs to be healed every 5 seconds.

The RE series was notorious for limiting your inventory so much and this game was no different.  You have little ammo and clumsy controls, limited health, and an inept partner who leads you to wasting most of your ammo anyway.  The game was totally unclear as to what you were supposed to do.  I basically ran around and just shot as many zombies as I could before getting cut in half by an axe.  The purposely limited view and lousy controls made a difficult game even worse.  I had the game on easy and couldn't even play 10 minutes before wanting to smash the disk.  Not fun at all.

For the serious gamers and RE vets this game will probably be manageable but I don't see the fun level in it.  Capcom may defend the controls and limited view as adding to the sense of uneasiness.  I say thats all a cover.  The controls suck and the average to novice gamer will hate them.  Bad bad game and I will not be playing another RE game anytime soon.",1.0
"Please read this review if you're like me and are getting suckered by all the 5 star reviews. If you're looking to use this as a real tool to learn to play guitar WITHOUT HAVING EVER PLAYED BEFORE, you will be sorely disappointed. I've never played before and thought this was my ticket. This game is an awful teaching tool. It will do nothing but frustrate and turn you away from wanting to learn. That's what it's doing to me. Use YouTube videos or pay for real lessons instead. It will be worth it in the long run. Unless you're content with learning to play 5% of the notes of any given song on this game then by all means buy this game and have a blast. When trying to learn these songs there's no way to look at the screen and find where I need to be on the fret and then strum the correct strings. You're doing 3 things all at the same time and I can barely keep up with looking at the screen, and thus I don't know which note to play next. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviews of this game are from people who have at least some experience and can enjoy learning to play new songs. This game does nothing to teach me anything. Considering returning it. I will say it's well constructed with features that appear to be teaching tools, but it's most definitely not for a true beginner who is looking to actually learn how to play guitar and play well.",1.0

CRAPPY GAME!  COD IS FAR BETTER!!!,1.0
"Appalling.

Even as far as mindless hack-and-slash games go, Yaiba is unforgivably terrible and forcefully difficult. Not in the sense that even old-school games are difficult, but because NOTHING has been developed properly in terms of balancing. One hit kills, random damage spikes and game-ruining glitches just happen... Constantly.

Yaiba has ZERO long-range attacks. So you know what's fun? Fighting the nth wave of melee enemies while five long-distance enemies pelt you with high-damaging, large blast-radius projectiles. Worse, even by the end of the game and with full upgrades, Yaiba is still weaker than even one of the first-introduced enemies of the game. Not only can Yaiba hardly take a hit without losing half his life, but it takes an UNGODLY amount of time to kill enemies with even the most base attacks. Even stupider, sometimes an enemy will abruptly die from two punches and the literal next time you fight the same enemy, he'll take upwards of (NOT KIDDING ON THIS) thirty hits. There's absolutely ZERO consistency to the fighting. Actually, the only consistent thing is Yaiba's ability to die quickly.

If it couldn't be any more of a travesty, Yaiba can only heal by performing the same obnoxious brutal kills on enemies. The catch? They can only be near death and within a brief window. After that, sorry, you don't get that chance back. This becomes insanely frustrating when you've just wiped out the fifth wave of enemies, are barely alive, and the game then spawns another wave of damage-sponges to duel. The closer you get to the end, the game simply refuses to climax and constantly forces you to fight boss characters again and again and again WHILE fighting all of the mid-bosses and bad guys at the same time. Even the final boss fight LITERALLY can't be beaten unless the game randomly spawns the appropriate enemy that matches the bosses' particular weakness at any given moment.

And then imagine doing this while the camera zooms backward to a fly's perspective of the carnage while the entire screen is lit up with explosions, fiery whirlwinds, and about twenty enemies all more powerful than you, attacking you, shooting you, and your're fighting them in an arena the size of a shoebox. Sound like fun?

Everything about the gameplay is misguided, but if you're here for the story, keep moving. Yaiba's ""narrative"" if you can even call it that, is nonsensical, hole-ridden affair that doesn't make one lick of sense (even by stupid cyborg ninja fighting zombie standards) and even Yaiba's resurrection isn't even addressed.

It's not only a detriment to the Ninja Gaiden name, but to gaming as an art form.",1.0

"PlanetSide 2 [Download] ...;  Free to play, if you do not mind getting slaughtered.  Like most AE games this is a pay to play or even compete.  Any upgrades you buy will be nerfed in about 2 months for fairness, or to get you to purchase the latest set of upgraded weapons.
This is supposed to be something like 600 years into the future, and sadly weapon tech has taken a turn for the worst.  There is no way to line up predictable perfect shot do to the weapon wobble and bullet scatter effect of this game.  Point blank rang or nothing.
The game is loaded down with aim bot and moment cheat hacks.  Unless you can compete in this area it is not worth your time.  90% of the time you will never see what killed you.
The physics engine is constantly being adjusted and is sadly not even close to realistic.  Bullet drop, vehicle handling, and aircraft flight will leave you insanely frustrated.
The game offer a massive map set, but mandates that you must be 5 to 10' from your target to have any chance of hitting it or doing damamge described under the weapon description.  The only way to truly get points in this game is to join up with one of the many rolling Zergs that manifest in this game.  Good luck if you try and stand in ones way.  The game also penalizes you for not being part of a group or squad.
Do some research, find another game.  You can do some much better.
Team kills are a constant, either by intention or accident. Lag spikes from other players will have them in places other then they appear to you making killing them impossible.

"First of all... Halo 3 rocked; one of the best console FPS franchises ever made. Halo 3 released in 2007 and since then MS released additional DLC (mp map packs).

The problem with ODST is that all the DLC you paid for comes now in a second disk. New Halo players may thinks this is great, but for those who already paid for these (Halo3 packs) it feels more like a robe. The way I see it, is like paying twice for something and thats not fair.

Now about ODST, it offers a 4-6 hours long campaing which is poor compared to its prequels, there are no graphical improvements in the game. The ONLY cool and new stuff is Firefight, wich is like GOW's Horde mode.

"After playing Live for the 360, it made me fall asleep, it was boring and while the graphics are excellent, it just has this weird vibe. The shots do not come off right, the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot, a defender can make up serious ground and block it.  Against the computer, I had JJ Reddick and Turkoglu blocked 5 times apiece by Mourning and Shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots. There are also a ton of missed dunks, even Howard missed several. It is hard to pull of three's as well, since their guaranteed bricks.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead. That should be the new name of this series. NBA DEAD 07.

I don't blame Mac for signing an NBA 2K7 game during Live's launch party. He knows what game is better!",1.0

"I purchased this because it said in the description that it was an official Nintendo controller, it is not. It does, however, look exactly like the official Nintendo controller so I figured there wouldn't be much difference, but boy was I wrong.

After a week the C stick would stick, meaning you would have to manually center it when not using it. The Z button also stuck, and I have yet to be able to to fix this... so when I play games with this controller it plays like the Z-button is constantly being held down.

Do not buy this, and I suspect many of the other GameCube controller deals online are similar to this. I'd recommend just going to the store and making sure you get an official Nintendo product, or even a quality 3rd party controller.",1.0

"Live takes a below and beyond fall in it's competition with the 2K series

Pros:

-Sweet graphics(On close ups, you can see the fantastic modeling on your favorite NBA players, and sweat)

-Marv Albert and Steve Keer comentating

-Updated rosters

-Still got create a player mode

Cons:

-The camera angles are so poor it makes a bum seem as rich as the creator of this console.(Seriously, I can't see layups or dunks for the life of me cuz of the crappy camera angles.)

-2 Modes!?(This systems younger cousin had a crapload of more varietey than this usless excuse for modes)

-No superstar abilities(Well, everything from the previous version was just flat out stripped, including the modes)

-The gameplay went from fast-paced to slow.(Now I'm in a diffrent paced limbo.  I'm used to rabbit speed, not a turtle)

-Too many blocks(Not a issue in the previous version, but I find me playing as Tim Duncan going for the dunk, and getting swatted by Chauncy billups.  Ok now they've done something you never seen before.  Good job EA!!)

-Ah, impossible free throw shooting(You know, I might have been able to eventually get over not having other modes, as long as I could win!  Free throws just blow more than wind.  I mean, they just completley threw away their old chemestry, and invented a crappy new one.  Using the R trigger to go down and up.  You can't limber to the left or right even a bit, and if your free throw shooter is 65% or below and on superstar, ods are you're gonna miss even if you get it right.  I mean it isn't ingenious at all.  I lost by 3 points on superstar against the Heat by going 2/33 at the free throw line(And I am dead freakin' serious about that).  And I was leading near the end, but the kept fouling me, I kept missing, and they came back like a bad memory.  The free throws just ruin everything, since I can't win, almost at all.  My last shot is always blocked!)

NBA Live 06 is just another reason for bEe gAy sports to just bow down to the 2k series and seriously just give up.  I mean even Madden blew donkey butt.  With this masterpeice of crap EA just completley lost all my trust in them.  I thought the Xbox version of NBA 06 sucked, man when I got a taste of this I vomited and thanked God I still kept my Xbox version.  I mean at least in that game I can hit free throws to still win.  I was hoping EA was holding out to make this better on the 360, but the took a giant crap on me and many other EA fans who bothered to shell out 10 more bux than the Xbox version to see if it would pay off and it didn't.  No body should buy this overpainted version of NBA Live 2002(That was the last live game to have 2 modes).  Go get 2k6(At least it stays to it's chemestry)

turns out it may be a bug specifically for the origin version of the game. Even if you use a non origin Sims 3 base game version and install apparently ANY of the origin expansion packs (i.e. those downloaded from EA's origin platform) it will get stuck.

Its terrible when a non-legit version of the game works better then the legit one!

the problem is now i doubt ill be able to get any sort of refund because i technically did not buy the product from EA and i doubt Amazon is going to give me a refund.

"If you own it...

The word ""scourge"" means to punish, chastise, or criticize severely, something you should be doing to yourselves if you picked up this game.

Scurge: Hive by SouthPeak Interactive did well to fly this under the radar. Much like Etrian Odyssey and other unhyped games, it just landed on the shelves of video game retailers everywhere one day. And one fateful day, I walked into EB Games and saw Scurge, and I had never heard of it before. So instinctively, I bought it. Plus, the cover had a nice yellowish-orangeish hue to it, and it looked sort of nice.

What a disappointment this was. I hate myself for spending the retail $29.99 on its release to purchase this abomination of a game. Maybe it's my critical side speaking, because the other two reviewers had pleasant things to say about the game.

The graphics are Super Nintendo at best, and I think SNES RPGs fared better in many situations. The gameplay is downright horrible, the functions are extremely clumsy, and you're stuck with a pathetic excuse for a gun that shoots little orb-like blips to kill enemies. I lasted a whole 30 minutes on the game before I started thinking about a possible way to repackage the item so I could return it for a full refund.

I always conclude my reviews with an analysis of the price of the game and what it has to do with its overall value. My purpose is to inform you whether or not I think the game is worth the price it's set at. It is for you to decide whether or not you agree with me, and for the review to be a determining factor in your hesitation to pick it up or not.

And so the price should say something about the game. After its intial $29.99 public release, it quickly fell to a meager $17.99 at EB Games / GameStops (I go to EB a lot if you didn't notice), then fell further to an unheard of $9.99. Brand Spankin New. Not used. BRAND NEW.

Ping Pals didn't even hit that low. You could pick up a brand new copy of Ping Pals for a measly $14.99. $9.99? And let me tell you, it's not even worth it at that. It should be given out for free, and even then, I don't think you should take it.

The USB dongle for it pulled apart completely the first time that I removed it from a system (as I was testing it on different ones). Finally got it back together enough to use but it is clearly not securely made and now I am wary of it coming apart again. Contacting Razer for a replacement proved fruitless.

"The reason I am not liking this keyboard is because it does not work the way it was advertised to work. The company advertises that 3 lights can be used/seen but when I try it nothing happens, When I received it 3 months back I took it out of the box (all in Asian writing by-the-way) and the keys were all lit up in blue lighting so I thought how cool. As time went by I wondered why the light just stayed blue even though the makers of this contraption stated you get 3 display lights. So I am thinking what's going on here. Why aren't the other 2 lights working? So I do more research on the thing and discover that the light changes colors when you use certain keys so I find out the keys are Fn+2 for dimming, Fn+8 for brightening, and Fn+5 of changing the colors. NOT! At least not for the keyboard I purchased. Over all, I came on Amazon to check out all the feedback from others who bought this thing and was surprised to find that a good 95% was very good feedback and the mere 5% from those who did not like the keyboard was for some other reasons other than getting the colors to light up, Sadly, I now believe I was just one of those unlucky people who received a malfunctioned keyboard that I can no longer return because my return policy has expired. :( I am grateful, though, that at least I do get one of the lights continuously lighting up for me.

"In The Groove is one of those self-proclaimed dance games made by dance game fanatics for dance game fanatics. The result is a challenging game, that also lacks any form of good taste, style, or class.

Okay, I don't know much about the In The Groove franchise but apparently it is dead. Konami killed it when they bought the name. Though supposedly the last game featured a patch that allowed users to insert USB drives on the arcade machine so they can play DDR songs on it, whooped dee doo!

The game itself is a blatant rip off of Dance Dance Revolution. The game uses the exact same format, same arrows, same stomping gameplay. In The Groove virtually does NOTHING to make itself stand out which is why the game is at best, only has a cult following behind it. But these same following insist the game is the best stepping game out there. Well, no, it isn't. Even the crappiest DDR titles (US versions, any of the mixes made for the Xbox and Xbox 360) out perform this game from production values, to the music.

The game is poorly presented and developed rather crudely on the PS2 which I wonder how this amateur got through Sony's QT. If you turn on a lot of modifiers, the game slows down. Load times are long. And the menu U/I is laughable at the very least. The worst offender of them all is the HORRIFICALLY BAD MUSIC. None of the artists in this game are assigned to any major labels, none of the songs sound good, and none of the songs will leave you wanting more.

In The Groove is a TERRIBLE game with really bad music, tacky style, and zero originality. Only folks who love terribly hard songs will enjoy this garbage, even then, they're only playing it for the step designs, not for the quality of music.",1.0

"I really tried to like this game. I thought I would give it a try because it was a the second in the series. Surely if it was popular enough to get a second game to come over to america then there must be something to it that must draw people in, right? Is it the odd concept for a game? Was it the fighting? The dating? I had to know what it was that drew people in, so I went out and bought the limited edition and tried it. After playing for 30 hours I can say that I have no idea. The dungeons are repetitive, the girls are very much the clich female types in a harem games and the main character is very much a Marty Stue. The kids were adorable, but I did not have much attachment to them because the main character cycled through them so fast and they had no characterization/backstory. The battle system was also very repetitive and I had no incentive to go to the next dungeon, I only did because the plot told me to. Grinding was unnecessary because the bosses never gave me much of a challenge, however if you wanted to get in good with the girls I found that it was almost necessary to enter the dungeons more than was needed. Forced grinding made me lose interest to stop playing it early even though I feel like I am near the end.
Dating was so easy; give the girl a gift and answer correctly (though, answering correctly did not matter that much because if you choose the wrong answer you could just come back, give a gift and make it all better) the multiple choice options. Which is typical for a dating-style game, but not entirely inventive and hardly the thing I would imagine to bring players to this game. It was scarily easy to woo even the most stubborn of the girls which made it hard to feel like I accomplished something by the end.
I understand it is an interesting concept, but the battle system, plot and character descriptions could have been written by a 5 year old. I would not have minded the fact that the girls were so fanservice-y if the game itself was even slightly interesting. I find I can't finish this game. After this many hours I feel like the plot should pick up and I should not feel like I am doing the same exact things as I was 20 hours ago. beautiful artwork and cutscenes; very bad game.

"I am a big fan of Super Monkey Ball 1 & 2.  I even liked the GBA game.  I expected great things from the Wii version of this game.  I slid the game into the Wii and started it up.  I immediately went into the main game and went to play.  According to the instructional screen I was to hold the wiimote parallel to my arm's direction (like a DVD remote) and tilt it.  I tried the game this way.  Its TERRIBLE.  This kind of precision work needs both hands on the wiimote, holding it horizontally - like a traditional gamepad.  This is how it is held in the WiiPlay cow racing game.  I played a few levels through and went out to change the control scheme to horizontal.  To my shock & horror, there was no way to change the control scheme.  You're stuck in one handed mode!  This is insane!  How could Sega have allowed this to happen?  They have to realize a game like this requires precision, and as such, the needs of their gamers will vary.  Why couldn't they offer alternate controls?

Disgusted, I went back into the game to give it another chance.  I nearly threw the remote through my TV after 10 or so ""fallout""s.

The mini games are garbage.  Don't bother.  I should also mention something about how painful the music is, but in fairness its not so much worse than the other games.

Sure, I'll give Sega credit for making games challenging to play, but if you make it too challenging, this is what you get! Glitches that cause trouble for the player who merely wants to scroll through the storyline.

Plus, I don't like the new look on Dr. Eggman. I mean he looks a bit younger.

"One reads a lot about how this game represents a big improvement over the original.  Maybe so, but that's little comfort if you're just dropping in for this installment, as I was.  Executive summary:  I hated this, just like I hate practically everything.

Here's just the first thirty-one reasons why:

1.  The controls are completely a mess.  Your guy seems to be agilely leaping up buildings and across rooftops, but only about 30% of the time is he actually doing what you want, despite what it looks like.  The rest of the time, he'll be hopping in haycarts, bounding up ladders, leaping into dovecotes, etc., without your permission.  Most of the time you'll be shouting at the screen:  ""No!  What are you jumping in that well for?  Why are you running up that wall for?""  This was a fixable problem, I think.  But I have no idea why the programmers insisted on having your guy have FOUR different speeds of ambulation, since the problem boils down to the fact that the same button that means ""interact with something"" is the exact same button for ""run really fast.""  I can't count how many times my guy ran up a wall and leaped back into a crowd of pursuing soldiers when I had intended nothing of the kind.  And don't tell me that I haven't played the game:  my savefile says I've logged over 100 hours playing!  If that's not enough to learn the controls, there's simply a problem with the controls.  (One way you can confirm how messed the controls are is to view walkthroughs of certain missions on the Web:  even for the self-styled masters who make these films, their guys are constantly doing things the player clearly didn't intend for them to do.)

2.  In the beginning of the game, you're dirt poor and must resort to pillaging corpses for wherewithal.  Midway through the game, though, you've got more money than you know what to do with.  It's ridiculous.  There should have been something that money was necessary for in the latter half of the game.  As it was, you could buy all the armor and weapons you wanted, but once you had upgraded Montereggioni, the money just poured in faster than you could possibly spend it.

3.  Why can't you skip the cutscenes?  The one near the end with Minerva was as intolerable as a geology lecture.  But even others, such as Ezio's preposterous and high-blown speeches to those he has just assassinated, ughhghghhh.  And you had no choice but to sit through these.

4.  Your weapons are a complete joke.  This is one of those games where if you get the next most powerful sword, all your enemies are granted the next most powerful set of armor, and on and on.  So that wonderful weapon you've been drooling over means basically nothing once you actually have it, as it doesn't really do much that lesser weapons didn't.  Heck, even if you get the game's most powerful weapon, it still takes several whacks to take out a garden-variety sentry.

5.  I thought this game would be a refreshing change of pace after my awful experience with the inane timed puzzles in God of War III.  But guess what?  This game also features an a**load of timed puzzles.  They're just more vicious (e.g., deliberately facing your guy the wrong way when a race begins, etc.).  There's not even any sense to them:  in Visitazione, for example, why can't Ezio simply jam that timer wheel, or wade through the water and simply clamber up the other side?

6. The game's pathetic attempts to shoehorn a ripoff of the Da Vinci code plot into the game were ridiculous.

7.  The game makes like it has a sophisticated combat system, but it really doesn't:  all battles can be solved by simple button-mashing.

8.  I love how the guards can outrun (or at least keep pace with) you, even though you're nimble and lightly dressed, and they're wearing plate mail!

9.  Searching for 100 feathers?  You gotta be out of your mind!  They must have really run out of ideas.  I mean, how loserly do these programmers think I am?  There's not even any map for the feathers, forcing you to go to the internet for such a map.  It's like they knew this game was so short, so they included something like that to take you an additional twenty hours before you could call it finished.

10.  There is no sneak mode, like there is in games such as ""Elder Scrolls:  Oblivion"" and ""Thief"".  Your guy can't sneak up on anybody except from behind, or hide in the shadows.  Why the heck not?

11.  You gotta love the people who are carrying boxes.  If you watch them carefully, they swerve right towards you.  And they only drop their precious crates when they bump into you, never anyone else.  And, uh, I know this is before Beccaria, but it's mighty dumb that if some guy bumps into you and spills his crate, 6-10 armed guards will immediately gang up on you and try to kill you.  I hear this game praised for realism, but this seems absurd.  There should have been a fine or something.

12.  You only get to used the vaunted Da Vinci flying machine 1.5 times during the game.  Why?  At the end of the game, the guy is apparently getting free rent from you in Montereggioni.  Why can't you force him to pay for his room and board by building one flying machine for each of the 5 cities?  Seems reasonable.

13.  The horse controls are totally messed up.  It's difficult to get on and off a horse, and horses are won't to stop for no reason whatsoever.

14.  The game is not complete!  This was a dirty trick on the part of Ubisoft, I think:  the game jumps abruptly from Sequence eleven to Sequence fourteen!  Where are the two other scenes?  Why you have to download them, and not for free.  Yes, this was the first video game I've ever bought where it's not complete unless you buy additional downloadable content for it.  I fear this is a sign of things to come.

15.  Your ability to leap around on rooftops is pretty stupid when ALL THE GUARDS CAN DO EXACTLY THE SAME!  Since when are they trained acrobats and assassins?  I could imagine if, say in one or two missions, you were battling another assassin.  But it seems like everybody in this game can perform all the same acrobatic feats that you can, making the game much sillier.

16.  You gotta be kidding.  I can't access the Armor of Altair, even though it's in my basement?  I own the property, plus I have like a zillion florins!  Why can't we just hire some welders to get through those iron bars, sacred seals be danged?  Or some masons to tunnel through the back?

17.  At least with the version of the game sold in the U.S., subtitles are not provided for any of the supported audio languages.

18.  The whole mechanism of hiding (i.e., blending, haystacks, etc.) was not well thought out.  It seemed like it had potential, but it was almost never necessary.  Either a whole mass of guards is on your tail and these techniques won't work, or you've already lost them and there's no point to diving into a haystack.  It seemed like the haystacks were put there to cover the ""cooling down, laying low"" time in the game -- only there never really seemed to be such times.

19.  If you're running one of the races during the day, you can't see the checkpoints on account of the sky also being white.

20.  The races aren't really a measure of skill but rather simply test how well you've memorized a maze.

21.  You spend your hard earned money on throwing knives, and in several missions, the game disables them without warning.

22.  There is no way to revisit scenes once you've passed them.  Assassinations I can understand, but why can't you run the races again?

23.  Related to this:  there's simply nothing to do once you've finished the game.  In Grand Theft Auto, you could at least busy yourself with ambulance missions and taxi missions.  I don't see why they couldn't have had endlessly available assassination and courier missions.

24.  You are not allowed to save your game where you want, only where the game wants you to save.  Worse, you cannot prevent the game from saving.

25.  There is no logic to what your character can climb up.  Sometimes, he can make an impressive vertical leap.  Other times, even though you can clearly see he's got purchase, he refuses to.

26.  The game is not kind to you if you skipped the first one.  You're going to spend the first two-thirds of the game wondering what's going on.

27.  The whole framing story with the Animus and the DNA added nothing.  Why couldn't you simply have been an assassin in late 15th-century Italy?

28.  The courtesans do not take direction well.  Apparently they have a hankering for those soldiers, because you can't brush past them without losing half your party.  They go off to ""distract"" them, even though you didn't tell them to.

29.  The targeting system is a disaster.  It's hard to tell when you're locked on to somebody, and the game keeps you locked on when it doesn't make sense anymore (i.e., your opponent has fallen off a roof).  You'll be throwing many knives into the ether, since the game suggests you're locked on when you're not.  Even when you're not, Ezio apparently needs contact lenses, as he seems to be unable to throw those knives more than ten feet, or in a downwards direction.

30.  I hated the way this game would force you to do something, then punish you for having done it.  Your character, during the cutscenes, is constantly doing things you didn't authorize and that you know are going to lead to trouble.  Hey!  Stop that!  I'm not climbing up to that girl's window!  And I'm certainly not sleeping there till late morning with her father in the house!  And no, I'm not participating in a street brawl!  I don't care if you are my brother!  The thing is, you saw ""you"" doing all these things, and then were expected to spend hours dealing with the mess ""you"" had caused.  Am I the only one who finds this kind of thing annoying?

31.  Catholics beware:  one of the missions requires the player to kill the Pope.  Add to this the fact that the assassins were, at least historically, a Muslim group and that there are many programmers in the credits with Arabic names, and I gotta wonder if this game wasn't some sort of joke played by the writers on the clueless Ubisoft management.  Maybe this is all a coincidence, but can you imagine Ubisoft coming out with a game where you're a Knights Templar assassin and you've got to kill the Muslim Caliph?  I don't think so.  You see, as far as the company's concerned, your religious rage is fine with them -- as long as it's not Muslim rage.

"Despite the rave reviews by UbiSoft employees posing as customers, Athena Sword, like Raven Shield, is substandard and buggy.
UbiSoft has a tendency to buy companies with hit titles, and then have their own development teams produce lower quality sequels, hoping to make sales on the strength of the original games' reputations. Ever since UbiSoft bought Red Storm Entertainment and started producing the Rainbow Six games themselves the gameplay has changed for the worse, the story lines have become increasingly contrived and obviously written with more concern for political correctness than realism, and the bugs have been out of control.
There have been over a dozen patches released for Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield since it's release, and Athena Sword has even more bugs. I have never owned a game which required so many patches.
The online play is nowhere near as good as Rogue Spear (although better than Counter Strike, if you prefer realistic tactical shooters to the run-and-gun arcade style games) and the single player campaigns aren't challenging enough to provide more than a few hours of entertainment.
If you've already bought Raven Shield and are considering buying Athena Sword, my suggestion would be to wait until the price drops, which is closer to it's actual worth. In the meanwhile, there are plenty of better designed user-made levels for single player and multiplayer play available for free download all over the internet if you're looking for more content for Raven Shield.
Here are a couple of the problems and bugs found so far:
While prone with the M240G Heavy Machine Gun, there is no animation of the belt being fed through the receiver
While using an Athena Sword weapon the hand and arm models in first person view have holes in the geometry
The SM4 CQB Machine Gun points around a 15 angle up
All of the Athena Sword weapons have the same firing sound with small tweeking, and not the awesome new sounds Ubi promised
The G3A3 and the G3KA4 appear to be identical to the player except for color
There are areas where textures which are supposed to be Flagged as false backdrop are not, and the skybox does not show through like it is supposed to",1.0

"I have played each Ghost Recon back to the original and before that the original Rainbow Six.

GRFS is not that much of an improvement over GRAW 2.

What is most annoying is the U-Play which forces you to login each time you play in stand alone. I surmise this was for some wacky DRM issue.

I no longer wish to play online so having to set up a U-Play account was rather tedious. I found out later that I could disable the U-Play checking for single player campaign. Today I got an email telling me that my U-Play account was hacked and that my information was stolen. Great so in order to keep piracy at bay Ubisoft put my personal identity on the line. As a consumer I'd rather it cost the multi-million dollar company than it cost me the lowly player.

Game play was weak and far from challenging I finished the game in a week with about 1 hour of play time per day.

So my cautionary tale is to avoid any Ubisoft game from here on out. I certainly will.",1.0
"Ill get straight to the point: Stay away from this game.

I have played The Icewwind Dale series, Baldurs gate 1 & 2 and the excellent Planescape: Torment several time over. They are all great games.

When it was announced a PC version of Temple of Elemental Evil, I was very excited. I remember the the thrill playing, and then DMing the PnP version of the game some 15 years ago.

And THIS is what they come up with?!? Crap!

1. Bugs. After installing the three official patches the game is still bug-ridden: clicking on a character brings up the inv. of another, spells don't work, desktop crashing, numerous clipping issues (which is very rare in 2D game), an interface that seem to do the exact opposite of what you want it to do. etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.

2. Tedious. The D & D 3.5 rules does not translate into a computer game. At all. It is that simple. In the Baldurs gate series the game play was fast, intuitive. exciting. In ToEE its a big yawn.

The Homlet quest are, with two exceptions, dumb, boring and errand boyish: Tell X to bring me a turnip, get a hammer for the blacksmith, tell X that Y really likes her, play cards with some bum at the inn. You get the idea.....

Combatwise it is none the better: I spent som 50 minutes chooping up 2 frogs just to get inside the Moathouse.

Had the 50 minutes been exciting I wouldnt mind, but its just a series of going through motions, linear clicking on options on each characters unwieldy radial menu.

Accurate representation of combat? Maybe.

Fun (which, in the end is why we all play computer games)? If your idea of fun is sticking needles in your eyes, this game is a blast.

3. Visuals & audio

The voice acting is in the top 3 worst games ever. A good example is the character Elmo whom you meet at the begining. After the encounter, I was left wondering if this was a joke on the gamers by the makers of this game.

The visuals are an anachronism. Great in 1998. Maybe. Today you get better visuals on high-end mobile phones.

4. The bugs, incredibly crummy gameplay, DD 3,5 rules, bad visuals and audio coupled with a thoroughly uninspired story makes this a game you should steer clear of.

Advice: If you haven't played the Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale serie yet: get those.

If you have: play them again

"A note to game developers everywhere.  It's possible to create a challenging game that does not involve intensely annoying obstacles.  Rule #1:  all games should have a quick save option at any point in the game.  No one enjoys going over the same mission over and over to get it right.  Mafia only saves at the end of a mission or important task--or not nearly enough!  This alone makes me want to pitch the whole mess.  Rule #2:  excessive amounts of driving around and map reading with old jalopy cars with extremely poor handling and dealing with other stupid drivers on the road is no fun attall!

"If you're contemplating whether or not to buy a last generation version of WWE 2K15 for money costs, DON'T. If you have to go months without playing WWE 2K15 just to save up enough money to buy 2K15 for the Xbox One or PS4, just do it. I'm getting WWE 2K15 for the Xbox One but had the pleasure---or non-pleasure of playing this at a friend's and it's not even worth the playing time.

2K put absolutely no effort into making last generation versions of WWE 2K15 even slightly enjoyable as WWE 2K15 is pretty much WWE 2K14 with a few new wrestlers on the roster. For starters, the gameplay is the same as it was for previous WWE games. If you want to experience the feel of new gameplay, you'll have to get it on a next generation console. Next, they excluded probably the biggest feature for this year's game from last gen consoles: My Career Mode. For years, fans have wanted this so 2K gave it to us.....but once again---you guessed it; it has to be on a current generation console. My Career Mode was supposed to feature you creating a wrestler and taking them up through developmental, NXT, and eventually the main roster. 360 and PS3 owners got the next best thing (I use that term very loosely) by giving them the Who Got NXT mode. Remember the lackluster Career Mode that took up space in SVR 2009 and SVR 2010 where you played a bunch of random matches with a superstar to get certain ranks?

Who Got NXT is a similar mode only slightly upgraded. Who Got NXT allows players to choose from NXT stars Adrian Neville, Bo Dallas, Corey Graves, Rusev, and Sami Zayn and play as them in a series of different matches to unlock the superstar they play as. Who Got NXT is fun at times but the fan is quickly tossed out the window when you play matches that have ridiculous and unnecessary objectives. For example there's a Ladder Match that you'll have against Bo Dallas and one of the objectives consists of preventing him from even remotely touching the belt. I can't tell you how many times I had to restart that match. 2K's definition of a challenge is the player's definition of uncalled for frustration. From there, they'll play a mode call Proving Ground where you fight John Cena in a match on Raw with a 30 minute time limit. Proving Ground is somewhat similar to 2K14's Streak Mode with Undertaker. The difficulty seems like it's on legend and of course you're facing Cena instead of Undertaker and with nothing on the line except proving your ability to hang with the big dogs. While it may be fun at first, after you've completed the mode, there's nothing left for you to really do.

The only thing that would really make the last generation version of this game any fun is the WWE 2K Showcase Mode. Reliving the classic HHH/Michaels and Cena/Punk feuds, playing through all their legendary bouts is a treat for any fans that'll keep them busy for a little while. Unfortunately once you finish Showcase and Who Got NXT, there's really nothing left to do. WWE Universe Mode is pretty much the same as it's always been. Maybe play a few exhibition matches with the new superstars? But even then, you're likely to become bored. Oh yeah, they also took out a bunch of stuff too. The Create A Story feature that had been in games since SVR 2010 is gone (whether it'll be in current generation versions is unknown). Custom music? Gone. Create a Finisher? Gone. Hell, Sting even looks like a created wrestler imported from Smackdown vs Raw 2006! It's almost like 2K completely gave a huge FU to 360/PS3 owners and punished them by making such an abomination of a game. At this rate bad games like Raw 2 and SVR 2008 put WWE 2K15 (360/PS3 versions) to shame.

Overall: Three words: SAVE YOUR MONEY. If you already bought the game, take it to your local Gamestop and trade it in. 2K didn't bother putting any effort into making WWE 2K15 even slightly enjoyable for last generation console owners and is incredibly evident that they did this on purpose to try and lure them into buying it for the Xbox One or PS4; so why should you waste $60 on a crapola game? And at this point, it's worth buying anyway. They screwed around with way too much stuff and made sure this game wasn't enjoyable in the least. This should be renamed WWE 2K14 Part 2 because that's what it is. Even WWE 2K14 is more fun than this! So overall, just save your money and buy WWE 2K15 for a current gen console. It'll have been worth it in the long run",1.0

(This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/04/2003)
--------------------------------------------------

I can't believe all the good reviews this game is getting. I just have to chime in with my opinion on this game.  Simply put, they broke Bust-A-Move. They removed almost all of the game play modes; they removed the edit mode; they made the controls unresponsive (they take a second to respond); they added annoying and distracting backgrounds; the bubbles have been graphically-enhanced so they they, too, are now annoying to look at; they took away all the cool characters and added a bunch of Pokemon rejects; and they added a TON of long loading screens.

Most of that is pretty much self-explanatory, so I don't need to elaborate on it. However, I will give you a list of what few game play modes there are in the game:

- 1 Player: Training / Normal / Classic
- CPU Battle: Normal / Expert
- 2 Player Battle: Normal / Expert / Chain Reaction

Yup, that's it.

I rented this game to see if I had made a mistake buying Bust-A-Move 4 (for the Playstation 1). Well, I can tell you this, my purchase of Bust-A-Move 4 was definitely well worth it. I have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Bust-A-Move-2/dp/B00006LU8X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Bust-A-Move 2</a>&nbsp;on my rental list. Although I suspect that it won't be much better than this one, I'll still be optimistic and give it a try.

If you want a good Bust-A-Move game to play on your Playstation 2, get yourself&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bust-A-Move-99/dp/B00000I1BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bust-A-Move '99</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bust-A-Move-4/dp/B000034DD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bust-A-Move 4</a>&nbsp;(both for the Playstation 1). Both are essentially the same, though 4 adds pulleys to the puzzles. Sure the graphics look like they came off of a SNES, but is that really such a bad thing?!? The load times are short (to non-existent at times), the characters look cool (in that odd-Japanese way), and most of all, the controls are extremely responsive and there are a ton of game play modes.",1.0

"Warning for those using the download option.  When I installed the game it took me to a registration prompt.  That seemed to go okay but when I log on to Uplay it doesn't show this game under my games.

I have contacted ubisoft and am hoping for a resolution but so far nothing.  They are asking for an activation code which we do not seem to get here.

As far as the game itself, I am enjoying it quite a bit.  For me it's pretty neat to see how this all started.  I'm having a good time playing through the missions and love the banter from the NPCs.

"If I wanted to play another AC title, I would buy an AC title. SoM takes everything from AC and somehow manages to mess it all up. I am a huge LotR fan, but I can not even get a small amount of enjoyment out of this title.

To start, the GFX are not on par. Most likely because it was made for PS3 and XB360 and then tweaked for new systems. When the protagonist first appeared I looked at his poorly done face and hair and just thought ""here we go.""

The world may not look bad, it is hard to tell because Mordor is always dark. Seeing things is a pain in the butt. The character takes up a good 1/3rd of the screen unless you sprint. So I have this giant cloak with a little bit to the left. So much of the screen is wasted because they wanted to be so zoomed in for no reason.

In order to see more you have to sprint. This is a bad idea because at any moment you can run into a band of patrolling orcs. So it is basically move to a spot, go wraith to see whats out there, move a little more, repeat. Getting into a fight with 5 or more orcs is not recommended.

Moving into combat. I don't know if they wanted a lose your way to victory type deal or what. They have a pretty neat system in place. If an orc beats you he moves up in rank and may challenge his captain to a duel. If he wins that he moves up higher. Problem is they almost always beat you. If it were one on one it may be different. However every time, every single time I face a named orc two to three more show up. So now there are three of them and it only takes two hits for you to die. There was a certain orc that, no matter where I was on the map, would show up when I engaged a named and he would always show up when my health was low. Being able to execute a stunned enemy is nice when you can use it. However if there is more than one orc it is not worth trying. You can get through the part of the animation where you stab the orc in the heart and neck, but the other guy will knock you off before you can slit the throat and that's a no go for death. The orc will just get back up and come at you. The animation takes way too long. If they were going to carbon copy AC they could have at least got combat right.

Like most games the camera just straight sucks. There isn't a more straight forward way to convey that. I was fighting a named orc, right before my buddy showed up, and we were not even on the screen. I was looking at a rock and a shrub while we fought some where below. Try to move the camera a little and it will zoom in that direction. Try to maneuver it to see enemies and it will just move all around you like a drunk mosquito.

Another annoyance worth mentioning are the cut scenes when a named orc joins the fight. which i was getting 2 to three times per. The screen zooming into a face saying ""I could smell your blood from blah blah blah..."" can really have an effect on what you were doing. Cut scene ends and oh by the way you were countering but took you finger off the button. Opps your dead.

It's a horrible game. There is no other way to put it. WB just tried to mash a bunch of ""been there done that"" mechanics into a LotR game in hopes they could grab multiple audiences. They even went as far as to give the main guy a broken sword that is almost identical to Narsil. They wanted him to portray Aragorn it seems. But I don't remember Aragorn hiding in bushes and sneaking around trying to back stab enemies one at a time because he had weak combat skills.",1.0

When I say slow I don't mean long or boring, I mean Sonic moves slower then Mario, and that is saying something. It wasn't an accidental bug or hardware issues either. It was meant to be. If you don't mind watching your favorite hedgehog crawl around the areas, you will probably mind the other diasters. Music? Makes Atari 2600 numbers sound good. Graphics? Makes Pong look incredible. Gameplay? I would rather play Mario's Time Machine for a week then this for 60 seconds.

Don't buy this, you'll never see Sonic the same way again. In fact, close this page and don't look into Labyrinth any farther.",1.0

"I am basing the current rating on the fact that they did not give me the promised pre-order bonuses and Ubsisoft has never responded to any questions about how to get it, even after providing them with a copy of my dated invoice proving I pre-ordered.

Of course, the larger issue is that I really REALLY hate it when game developers lock game features and items behind such stupid stunts. It's one thing to make it a pre-release bonus that won't otherwise be available until later, but what they are doing is just wrong. You also have to login to a Ubisoft account in order to get a number of items in the game that should just be part of the game.

If they ever actually give me what I paid for I will update this review based on the contents of the game, but seriously, you clearly cannot trust Ubisoft to deliver on any pre-order promises.",1.0

Almost $100 for

It says you can get a free trial of PLAYSTATION PLUS if you sign up for it then after you sign up it won't let you get the free trial !
You have to search for the trial - THEN - sign up for it then it renews ! IT DOESN'T SAY THAT !
I have spent over 325$ ON GAMES AND CRAP and I only have three games to play !

"I love the Spyro series. My favorite was Spyro Year of the Dragon which was perfect. When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me. For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)

Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.

Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?

Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.

Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.

Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.

 In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands. I would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of, but given the bad recession this series has had lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",1.0

"Oh God, how I hate this game!
What's most important in this game: the combos you have to make and it NEVER works!!!??
Maybe it's because I'm left-handed and I do not have enough control, power and speed in my right hand (fingers), but I suspect it has to do with Gamecube's controller with this particular game.  (The Gamecube controller I actually like very much, there isn't a single game that gives me problems for being a left-handed gamer, the c-stick for instance, an annoyance for many people,  I handle pretty well)
This game did ruin my good mood completely.
Not only do you have to push the right combinations, but it also has to be done in a certain fashion: rhythm and timing must be 100 percent accurate or else you fail and fail over and over again.
Good lord, what a terrible waste of time this game is.

Well obviously it isn't any fun for me, but I can imagine that with a different controller (PS II or XBox) it'll be more comfortable. Still, any game that depends heavily (not to say completely on swift and acrobatic fingerworks suck big time!",1.0

"Diablo 3 is nothing but a poor man's WoW. On higher difficulties, it's a constant gear check where nothing useful ever drops. There is little to no re-playability, there is no variety, the side quests and events are not interesting at all. The itemization makes most of the gear useless and not even worth putting on AH. The storyline and dialogue are mediocre and resemble Saturday morning cartoons, although D3 is rated M. If you can't afford buying off of AH, you have to grind indefinitely to progress in inferno. Difficulty levels vs. classes are completely dis-balanced.

Diablo 3 sold over 6 mil at launch, the sales that are solely based on the promise and reputation of the past games. The game itself has little of anything positive to offer on its on.

The game is sold as a sexy game but when actually played it turns around and literally preaches to you. The disturbing use of sheep I believe is supposed to be symbolic of lost sheep suffering in hell.  The end ok each level after cube building you way out of hell at the top is a church and you have to go in the confessional to end the level. The game play is your character playing a boring repetitive cube puzzle game were each level is the same only you have to go faster.

"At long last, I've finally found it...I've finally discovered it. The worst game ever conceived by an established video game studio. Ever.

Ever.

There is simply no excuse for the production quality and design elements of this game. It's not just lacking a layer of polish like some games which are rushed out early by a company's publisher.. it's lacking anything remotely resembling a gaming soul. It's wretched to the point where I'm almost convinced the developers made the game the way it is on purpose... everyone sitting around, drinking, giggling, cheering as they come up with another aggravating gameplay feature with which to torture the unwary gaming populace. Truly, you really have to TRY to make a game this loathsome, this abhorrent, this... painful.

Nearly EVERYTHING in this game is just... WRONG. From the archaic, ""now you can control me, oops lol now you can't"" camera that refuses to show you anything you really need to see to the unbelievably rotten ""combat"" system that makes fighting an agonizing chore, to the PSX-quality textures and pop-up, to the totally uncessary inclusion of a hidden stamina meter that keeps you from sprinting for more than 5 seconds per minute, this game is just an abomination... a freak of gaming nature... an utter insult to the gaming industry's sensibilities. It's a steaming fecal nightmare delivered unceremoniously from the rotting bowels of Team17 Software onto the collective face of videogaming. Yes, the industry is now worse off from the mere existence of this game. If you've ever seen, played, or heard of this game, you've taken a step back in your own personal evolution.

Team17 should be ashamed of themselves. Go ahead guys, take off one or two or 15 years and go stick your heads in the sand on some uncharted Pacific island, until humanity has forgotten most of what has transpired here. Shame, shame, shame. SHAME ON YOU. And God help any of you who list this game as a past project in your resume/CV, as truly any hint of involvement with such trash should immediately have you blacklisted from participating in the development of any other video game, ever again.

"Im so shocked.... this is weak. I've played soul calibur since the 2nd one and the 3rd blew me away with all the great new addons
and from what ive seen in 4 the company just gave up.
theyve switched a nice custom character creation with simply editing main game chars. theres no legit sidequest its just a tower with a bunch of enemies, vs mode, arcade mode, and story mode. thats it... sad sad sad
all theyve done is added yoda, gave it new graphics and removed the things that made it great and stand out in the figthing genre.

i though we had a new standard of big name games since the new systems came out obviously the group behind bandai namco's soul calibur4 has ignored that. they figured pretty graphic playing online and yoda can justify 60$

dont even bother wasting the money renting this, go buy a ps2 if you already don't have one and get soul calibur 3 other than graphics its a massive improvement and you won't feel cheated. yes even after paying for a ps2 youll feel less cheated.

SINGLEPLAYER:  The story is so stupid and, as others have stated, they do not explain ANYTHING.  You get grabbed by some team of cliche people.  The hot head who smarts off all the time, the girl who automatically defends you when criticism comes up, and the ethnic leader of the RESISTANCE.  There were times where I actually laughed at the stupid voice overs in the cut scenes.

MULTIPLAYER:  This sums up the whole multiplayer experience: ""THE RICH GET RICHER"".  The whole battle point system is so stupid.  Everyone just camps and hides so they can rack up points and then they get health boosts as well.  So you've got a guy that is harder to kill, hiding in a house, racking up points.  Then he calls in a chopper that DOMINATES the entire map.  Spawn?  Killed by chopper.  Spawn and run.  Killed by chopper.  There is only one anti-chopper weapon in the game and the little drone is so hard to get out and aim at the chopper you might as well try to lead the chopper with an RPG.  Basically it is a camp fest that ends in a godlike chopper reigning down fury on everyone as they spawn.

"You can clearly tell Microsoft was rushed to put this out after Sony first launched PS4 ahead of them. In result, the controller is less ergonomically designed so it was very difficult to wrap my hands around the controller as the trigger buttons are more carved in and the controller is smaller than the 360 version. I was very excited to get this to use on my PC but after a short usage I was very disappointed. Buttons gotten more tricky to press around and the grips felt terrible. I would recommend 360 controller over this one any day, and unfortunately the PS4 controller over this as well. I own 360, PS2-4, and I was really considering to buy the Xbox One as well but this, the controller was a big deal breaker.

Charging $60 for this is just plain wrong.

"Let's cut through the bull here and admit what the fan boys want to avoid, this game is ugly.

Visually the game is ugly. What on Earth eye the publishers thinking. I've seen 3DS titles that looked cleaner. When you need every sense available in a game that is so punishing hard, losing sight of enemies because they are so blocking they blend into the background isn't acceptable.

The camera is uglier. For most of the game I felt claustrophobic add the camera zooms in tensely. Due to the nature of the game you need to scan a lot and a boxed in camera gets tiresome quick.

The targeting system is the worst. Why the lock target button is mapped to the camera orient button I'll never know. If you have to fight more than one enemy you'll be hosed. The target will jump if you try to seeing the camera too aggressively. It also seems like the camera swings wildly when running up on an enemy to land a critical attack if a second enemy comes out. Wouldn't be as big of a deal if the death system want the way it is with this series.

My final complaint with this series is the lack of reward for exploration. It takes a lot to win a single battle with a tough opponent and you have a slim chance of making it to the next bonfire so it's not very rewarding to go out on a limb.

The straw man with this series is that any criticism is met with people saying it has faults. Yes the difficulty is up there. I don't mind that. I don't want a game that allows me to bull rush a room without a strategy and win. Dying usually makes a game more fun but not this one. If the controls were tighter and combat felt more rewarding than sluggish I'd be willing to recommend this game but as it is now it's a terrible game that people defend because playing through it is a rite of passage.

"This game is garbage. It was clearly rushed and as of 12/31/2014, multiplayer matchmaking still doesn't work correctly. That's pretty bad for a game released in mid-November.

The biggest problems with matchmaking continue to be the game's inability to keep your party together from one game to another and the game's inability to evenly parse out teams for each match.

5v5 matches on maps designed for 4v4 play? Yep.
4v3 matches 75% of the time? Yep.
Splitting a party up across two teams? Yep.
Freezing at the post-game menu screen and/or getting dropped from your party? Yep.

Despite the fact that 343 claims that they've fixed many of these issues, they HAVE NOT done so. Additionally, as many have noted, Halo and Halo 2 are ported from their previous PC versions as opposed to the original Xbox versions. Because of this, glitches exist in these games (both single player and multiplayer) that shouldn't even be there to begin with.

Again, this game is garbage. It's a cash grab. Buy it only if you want to play through the single player or if you plan to play multiplayer by yourself (which works reasonably well). Don't buy this game if you plan to join a party to play online.",1.0

Seriously though, this game is absolutely terrible.  The graphics are bad even for the PSX, the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell, the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless.  There was no reason for there being 40 something characters, most of them were exactly the same statwise, and all of them were poorly designed.  The most annoying thing in the world, bar nothing, is having to re-equip all your character's spells whenever you switch characters.  You have like 50 spell slots.  God.

"Eidos really dropped the ball here, folks.  As usual the story is great, although there are a few notable inconsistancies that will hopefully be explained in the next game.  However, the poor controls and obvious lack of beta testing kill this game.  First, to attack you have to target an enemy.  Usually not a problem, but while targeting, you cannot jump. You can also only dodge left-right, not back or jumping.  Second, while sucking blood, you're stuck in the equivalent of a very repetitive cutscene, where you are still vulnerable to attack though can do nothing to avoid the blow.  Third, if you die, you have to watch any cutscenes between you and the last checkpoint over again, no way to skip them.
As for glitches, there are hundreds if not more.  Clipping is horrible, people fall through walls.  Not a problem, unless you wanted their weapon.  Well into the game, many people, myself included, lose the ability to save, by either getting a Save Failed message or a corrupt new file, which has led to a few people having to start over.

I returned the game, and Amazon was very fair regarding a refund.

"First of all, any review of this game dated before March is a load of lies. LIES!!!! This game was not available until 3/2005! Not August 2004!!! How honest can a reviewer of this product be if the game was not available at the time the review was written? Go home losers! Get a life!

Let me cut to the quick -

Brothers in Arms tries to be Call Of Duty with squad based action. IT FAILS MISERABLY!!!!!!

This game tries to offer a really solid, SQUAD based game. No more typical First Person shooter. In other words, you don't go running full speed shooting everything in site! And your squad mates actually do help you defeat the enemy.

SADLY, this sounds better than it actually is.

Game graphics -

This game runs on the Unreal Engine so I expected top of the line graphics. You get far less than that! Even the soldiers have NO facial expressions. Their lips move but the face does not change or offer any emotion or expression. Stick lips on a 2""x6"" pine plank and you will get the same experience!!!

Vocals/Dialog -

OHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh soooo painful! Cliche' after cliche', tons of curse words thrown in as a desperate attempt to give you the ""grit"" of war. Bad monologues that run on forever, bad cutscenes, nothing interesting at all.

Weapons -

Nice selection...but highly inaccurate!!! To get any accurate shooting done, you MUST aim down the barrel. With all the fast action going on, you have no time to aim and line up a shot. If you shoot with out aiming, you better be 2 feet away from the guy...and even then they will kill you quick!!!

You will not get the chance to use many of the weapons either...unless you hunt on the ground for the dead soldiers dropped weapons.

Gameplay -

Squad based activity is decent but repetitive. The missions are almost pointless and definitely are redundant! It winds up turning into the same thing everytime. Get ready, start the mission, Germans appear, order your squad to provide cover fire while you flank them and kill them. Wash, rinse and repeat....until the game is finally done!

Game Length -

Short and not creative. I finished this game on the Difficult setting in 7 hours. I finished it on the hardest setting in 10 hours. Too short and the gameplay is so clumsy at times that you just don't want to play it again. Not rewarding at all.",1.0

"I have consistently ran into issues with this mouse after updating to Windows 10; specifically, the number one thing I use this mouse for is World of Warcraft, so the twelve side buttons are a must-have. Since upgrading to Windows 10, there is a 50% chance that the side buttons' mapping will not be recognized; I would be willing to bet it has something to do with the ""default profile"" having to swap over from the mouse's internal default upon Windows startup. A reboot of the computer is the only way to resolve the issue, and even still it's a 50/50 shot (sometimes takes two to three reboots to fix).
I have tried the following troubleshooting steps, per the Corsair forums at [...]
 - Uninstalled and reinstalled Corsair Utility Engine software
 - Tried each USB port on my computer
 - Ensured I am using the most up-to-date CUE
 - Verified all side buttons are properly mapped to their corresponding physical keys (I have mine bound to NumPad 0-9 as well as NumPeriod and NumMinus)
 - Navigated to my system's Control Panel > Device Manager > Uninstalled Corsair Composite Virtual Input Device, removed and reinserted USB, then restarted CUE

I had very high hopes for this mouse, and everything else works fine; the color schemes, the mouse wheel, and the DPI buttons work as advertised based upon how you have your DPI settings stored in the CUE. However, the side buttons are a necessity, and seeing as there are multiple requests in Corsair's forums to fix this issue and nothing's been done to fully resolve it, I have to chalk this up to a $60 waste of money. Sadly, Corsair should just stick to what they do best: RAM. They've offered nothing in the way of support or assistance. For how much this mouse costs, it is not currently worth the investment; I would instead recommend a Razer Naga MMO mouse, solely for the sake of reliability.",1.0

"El juego no es malo, pero me siento TOTALMENTE decepcionado. Soy comprador de FIFA desde el 2007 y esta entrega se la vendi a un amigo porque me parecio una falta de respeto TOTAL a los usuarios del juego.
Como primera medida, las diferencias entre el FIFA 2011 y el 2012 a nivel de juevo NO SON tantas como anuncian, salvo detalles, el resto es mas marketing que otra cosa.

Por otro lado y el PEOR punto del juego es Ultimate Team. En la version anterior usaba Ultimate Team TODOS los das, jugaba online TODOS los dias y hasta en el trabajo estaba detras de que item habia vendido o cual habia ganado... asi que era una adiccion total... hasta que salio el Fifa 2012. Cambiaron el diseo de la web a uno que a mi como diseador no me lleva mas de 5 hrs de trabajo, minimizaron el tamao de las cartas, la resolucion en la calidad de las imagenes de los jugadores y lo que es peor: LA INDUMENTARIA ES MAS CHICA Y DIBUJADA! Ahora ya no se le ven los detalles como antes, de logos, costuras, publicidades, detalles de cada indumentaria en si...

"This game sucks.

I started this thinking ""BTTF...BTTF....""
I run around trying to find the Back to the Future ride
Theres no map
Eventually, I talk to somebody and they say you can get a map at the entrance, somebody is handing them out
So, I run around trying to find the entrance
And also, the camera sucks
You can't move it
AT ALL
When you walk off screen, that's when it changes
It doesnt just move, it completly changes an angle
so, I'm trying to figure out where I am
And the transitions don't make sense
Say I walk left to the screen
I walk up on the next one
I walk down back to the last screen
Then I walk up to THAT one
And when I DO get the map, there's no arrows to see where I'm facing or anything, so tectonically it's useless!
So I DO find the BTTF Ride
I want to go in it
""There's too many people in line!""
There's about 12 people in line
So, what do I do
You can buy a hat that gives you unlimited visits to an attraction
How do you get money
You pick up trash
How does trash appear?
At Complete Random
And It costs 2500 points for a BTTF hat
and each piece of trash you throw away is only worth 100 points!
So, after a half hour, I have enough points
I go over to Woody Woodpecker to buy the hat
I also talk to this person that gives me a ticket that lets be first in any attraction
So, I go through the labyrinth to the BTTF ride
""There are too many people in line""
""...""
""Wait!""
""You have an E-Ticket! You can only use it once, so don't waste it! Go on the ride?""
I don't want to waste my E-Ticket, I want to use my item
But nope
You HAVE to use the E-Ticket first
So, I decide I'll go on the Jaws Ride
So I go through the Labyrinth AGAIN
I go on the ride
So this is the ride:
You're on a ship, and Jaws is attacking
You have to pick up barrels
A to pick them up and B to throw them
WHY COULDNT THEY BE THE SAME BUTTON
THAT WOULD BE ALOT EASIER
HALF THE TIME I HIT A AND WONDER WHY NOTHINGS HAPPENING
Anyways, out of complete random, Jaws comes out, and you have 1 second to throw the barrel
And it takes you about 1/3 of a second to throw it
Otherwise he attacks you
6 times, you're dead
There's a map to show you when he's attacking
But its the same as the park map
There's no sense of direction
Am I on the left side or the right side of the boat
Oh wait, my 1 second is over
So, I lose the game
I walk out
And I see the Waterworld line is short
So I go on there
NOT EVEN A GAME
This is what you do:
You pick a seat
Then you watch a terrible CGI cutscene of a plane going down a slide and burning
Thats it
I SUMMARIZED THE WHOLE CUTSCENE FOR YOU
If you pick different seats, you can watch it from different angles
Sometimes they're the exact same, just flipped horizontaly
No wonder there was no line
So I'm pretty desperate to go on the BTTF ride now
I leave
I go to to the ride
""There's too many people in line""
Me: ...
""There's too many people in line""
Me: O_O
You know what I did wrong?
When you buy the item,
You don't get it
You have to PICK IT UP
YOU DONT
GET
A
SECOND
CHANCE
So, what do I do
PICK
UP
MORE
TRASH
So, after going through all that stuff, I buy my item, I PICK IT UP, I go to the ride, I say I want to get on
""There's too many people in line""
Me: ...
You Bought the Item
You Pick up the Item
YOU HAVE TO PUT ON THE ITEM
WHY CANT I JUST BUY IT AND THATS THAT
So, I GO INTO MY INVENTORY
I PUT ON THE ITEM
AND I FINALLY GO IN

Now, really. Just guess. Do you Think the Back to the Future ride will be GOOD? Well, its not.

"I play a lot of sub par to bad games.  I consider myself very patient and forgiving with most titles when most people tend to write them off and unplayable.  As a testament to this I actually finished this game.  Now while that may not sound like much of an accomplishment, trust me it was!  This game is quite bad all around just shy of being unplayable.  My thoughts;

Pros (I struggled with some of these)

+ Interesting alternative history premise (albiet terribly overused).  Nazi's win WWII and invade the U.S.  Not very original but still an interesting idea nonetheless.

+ Great opening level of descending a skyscraper being constructed while the Germans destroy it.

+ Outstanding musical score composed by the amazingly talented Michael Giacchino (Lost, Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, Cloverfield etc.)  Honestly this IS the best part of the game and I still felt bad that his name was tied to the title.

+ Very short (trust me it's a good thing in this case)

Cons

- Awful and unforgivable framerate issues, lag and slowdown throughout the entire game.  Firefights with multiple enemies onscreen and various explosions is when it's very evident.  The game will literally slow to a crawl.  Whenever the action heats up the game slows down.  Perfect! (Note: My machine is far beyond the required specs for this title.)

- Extremely lackluster graphics for a 2008 game.  Poorly rendered textures on nearly every level.  Some wall and ground textures and deplorable.

- Flawed weapon targeting.  Many times you'll clearly shoot someone yet the bullet never hits them.  Items often obscure shots when they clearly they shouldn't.

- Terrible weapon sounds.  Weapons and sound effects were often crackling and overly distorted.

- Little to no effort put in from the X-Box port.  The icing on the cake is when they're asking you to perform certain tasks in the game they tell you to press this button and show you a diagram of a 360 controller instead of the appropriate PC key!  Laughable, lazy and emabarrassing.

To sum things up, this game is a sad, buggy mess and near impossible to really enjoy.  There was potential there but I have absolutely no idea where the developers left it.  Clearly it didn't end up in the game.  I think I bought this game on clearance at Target for  [...] and I still felt ripped off.  Avoid this title unless you have absolutely nothing else to play and possess the patience to endure all of the above.",1.0

"On the positive side you have the new punching mechanic called 'full spectrum punch control'.  It's much easier to throw upper cuts and hooks and has all the variations like upper hooks etc.  The graphics of the fighters are better also.

However, on the negative side, you seem to land thunderous blows one after another only to do no damage to your opponent; all the while your controller is vibrating like crazy.  And then all of the sudden your character or your opponent's is down and out.  I landed haymaker after haymaker from Mike Tyson on Ali's temple which would have felled a redwood only to see Ali simply take each one in stride.  Additionally, the fighters are far too energetic and it becomes an Arcade game quickly.  It's a much less realistic fighting sim than Fight Night Round 4.

I hope the next iteration of the franchise combines the Full Spectrum Punch Control of Champion with the game mechanics of Round 4.  Then, you would have the best of both worlds.  I feel Champion is unplayable.  Get Round 4 for sure!",1.0
"I wonder if the people who have so far reviewed ""The Bard's Tale"" (PC) on the web actually played it or the demo, or if they are relying on the reputation of previous games with the same name to make a judgment call about this game. I do not believe many did play it, because if they did, they would have seen how frustrating and how little fun the game becomes as it drags on. Yes, the voice acting is funny and enjoyable, but a cute and quirky story cannot make up for the game's overall poor design.

During certain animations (and more importantly during battle) the game will slow to a crawl comparable to the lag you might experience playing a newly released MMORPG on a dial-up connection. The slow down is a known problem for users of certain models of GeForce and Radeon cards, but not all users will be affected. As of the date of this review, there is no support for this issue and no official forum for discussion of such tech problems.

Don't rely on the game box and screenshots as a judge of the game environment. Basically we are dealing with a slightly modified, old fashioned top-down view with the added bonus of trees and other structures that must become transparent to allow you to see your character as you move under them. Due to the limited field of view, the minimap becomes essential to know what is a few feet away from you, either because you will not be able to actually see monsters until they are practically right on top of you or because they will be obscured if they move under trees that you are not under at the same moment.

Yes, you have companions that have cool powers that will be helpful in different situations. But no matter what you do, if you are ganged up on by more than three monsters at once, you may as well give up and load your game. This is because most of the monsters you fight have a tendency to knock you down or stun you for some time when they hit. Basically, if you cannot block perfectly, you will be round-robined to death as you enemy takes turns knocking you down and doing damage to you while you cannot stand up and recover. Meanwhile your companions will do whatever would be most illogical in such a situation: Healers will run forward and fight monsters with their fists, warriors will stop fighting in the middle of a battle and simply stand still, ranged weapon users will fire at monsters offscreen, drawing them into the battle.

Forget about the claim ""less A, more I"", the monsters aren't any better than most games...you will simply be overwhelmed with numbers in most cases.

"My score for this product is based mainly on its value (i.e. what you get for what you pay).  The content of this DLC really should have been included in the game.  I suppose there may have been time constraints so it couldn't be included as such, but regardless this supposed ""DLC"" is worth $2 at most.

You get colorization options which is very nice because you can give each squad member their own color or simply color them based on class so you're not wondering what those symbols next to their names mean.  The helmets are also a really nice addition, especially when you start using the heavy armors.  It really just looks silly having an exposed face/head with heavy, high-tech armor.  I really don't know how your armor makes you invulnerable to poison if you don't have a dang mask!

There's also some new hairstyles, including a classic Xcom ""flat top"", which makes your soldiers even more unique and distinctive.

If I was rating the content itself, regardless of the price, I'd still only give it a three, again because some of these customizations should have been in the base game (it even says the word ""Helmet"" in the customization options of the base game, there's just no helmets).  Considering the high price tag for something that should've been in the base game I consider this DLC an insult and I wouldn't pay any more than $1 for this.",1.0

"The original Duke Nukem was astonishing for it's time. Cutting edge, rough and tough, and full of awesomesauce.  This absolute waste of money was a long time coming and a HUGE disappointment.  Instead of cutting edge it's about as pathetic as you can get.  I'd look up some free to play MMOs instead of bothering with this bag of fecal matter.

I played it for 2 hours because I was hoping at any time the pure awesomeness of the Duke would kick in, instead I was bored to tears and relegated myself to watching Dr. Oz with the ol' lady.  I pawned off the game to my son who first whined about it being a Steam game(I won't comment on that) but finally installed everything.  After 30 minutes of trying to find the hype his dear old dad had been spewing about the Duke his comment was, ""Dad I thought you said this game was awesome, it's terrible""

I am saddened that the reincarnation of my favorite game of yesteryear was such a letdown.

The graphics on the commercial are pre-rendered.  I'm running an i7 2600k with 16gb ram and an ATI 6870 with every setting on max and it looks mediocre at best. None of the modern 3d effects and the general rendering is pretty blah.  Compared to something like the graphics in Rift, there is no comparison.  Maybe the console versions are better but I doubt it.

There are so many boring cutscenes you spend as much time with your arms crossed watching the tiring dialogue as you do playing.

The AI is absolutely bottom rate.

There are a few cute lines, but not much new, it was mostly re-used from the original.

I tried playing with a ps3 controller, with a keyboard and by pure facerolling and nothing helped make it interesting.

"I don't know why this product has so many positive reviews, plain and simply this product is junk.  Save your $2.00.

You get three screen protectors, good luck trying to get one of them applied correctly.  The sticky side is so strong you have to pull very hard to get it off the plastic protector.  I did this on my first attempt and hit my shirt, it picked up lint and immediately ruined it.  Also, the cloth provided sheds tons of lint, so don't use it to clean your screen before application.

I managed to get my second protector on as instructed and lint free.  However, it traps air bubbles like crazy.  It says to use the tool to get the air bubbles out, but no tool is provided.  I used the the cardboard packaging.  After about a 1/2 hour I got 1/2 the air bubbles out, however, there were bubble marks where some of the bubbles used to be.  I tried to remove the screen but it holds fast and it ripped when I finally removed it.

I tried a third time being extra careful and patient with my last screen cover, but still no matter how I tried applying the protector, it kept trapping bubbles and removing the bubbles still left bubble marks.  Lastly, the screen is about 1-2 mm too short for the PSP 3000 screen.",1.0

"Everything about this game is horrible. It is bloated and joyless. The controls are the worst yet in an AC game. The 'context sensitive' running is just an abomination. The entire game you will feel you are fighting the controls.

The combat is a step back. Two steps back. Three steps back. In fact, it is the worst combat in *any* AC game. Even AC1 had better combat, and the combat in that game was atrociously bad. Gone is the fluid exciting combat of AC2, 3, and 4. The combat here is a long, tedious, boring, slog.

I couldn't believe how terrible the 'The Tournament' mission was. It decides to introduce 'timed parkour'. But the controls in this game, particularly when trying to run and be precise, and make jumps at specific objects near other jump able objects, are abysmally bad.

Whoever decided to implement the sewers in this game should be fired. The AC games are about the joy of the fluid, limitless, high speed rooftop traversal of exciting locations- mixed in with a judicious amount of assassinations.

The underground sewers and tunnels in Unity are colossol, joyless disaster on every possible level. Cramped, dreary, empty, drab, and samey, the rob the series of everything that makes it fun. It's an arbitrary maze in a game with no map, full of dead ends. Every moment spent in the sewers,whether in a mission or chasing down far too many collectibles, is an unenjoyable slog.",1.0

"After hearing good things about this game, I finally decided to buy it, and it was one of the worst mistakes I've made in a long time. Let me start by saying that action games, specifically shooters, are by far my favorite genre. Some of my recent favorites are Killswitch, Rainbow Six Vegas, Sniper Elite, Fear, Condemned, Project Snowblind, Prey and Nightfire just to name a few. Basically, I've been playing FPSs since Medal of Honor on PS1 and SOF on PC, so inexperience is not the reason I dislike this game.

This game is just terrible as a whole. The graphics are abysmal, the gameplay is not challenging or fun, the sound is bad, plus there is zero originality. This game has no redeeming factors, and this is coming from a legitimate fan of the genre. The guns look terrible, the squad controls are weak, and the levels are uninspired. I just can't think of anything good to say about this game. The second you get past the menus and the gameplay starts everything just keeps getting worse and worse. The only people who I can see defending this are people that tested it or kids who don't know better.

If you want a good action game, play any of the ones I listed, all of them are $10 or less now, and it's the best time to pick them up if you haven't already. This game is a total failure, and anyone who says otherwise simply hasn't played any good shooters. Try Rainbow Vegas or Global Operations (A PC classic) if you want a good counter-terrorist experience. Even the port of Counter Strike on Xbox is more fun than this trash, and that's saying something.",1.0
"Where to start...

1st. Issue is the top cushion on the head band is really uncomfortable! it is not flat so it is this kind of rounded off narrow edge where it pushes in the middle of your head... It's not the worst thing about it but it was something I noticed right away... maybe it is just in that perfect spot but either way this was not good for me. I had to put tape on it to mash it down flat where it was bearable.

2nd. issue is the ear cushion rings are so small in diameter that the cushions just rest on top of your ear instead of around your ear so after a while your ears will start to feel really squished as if you were laying down on the hard floor and woke up with your ear hurting from laying on your side of the face.

3rd. issue is the type of material the ear cushions... It is some strange rough canvas type felt or some strange material I cant really explain... It almost feels dirty and old maybe like it sat in the sun for a year or something, so you end up with this weird hot feeling and it just isn't comfortable at all. I ended up flipping them inside out and surprisingly the inside orange material is actually really nice feeling where your skin can breathe and on top of that it seems to help a lot since the ring on the ear part is so small so it kind of balances out the pressure but that still wasn't very comfortable after a while so I took off my other headphone cushions which are much bigger and put them on top of these where it was a perfect fit and felt good.

4th. issue is how strong these are pushing against your ears so with all the negative factors I mentioned, it is just too much to handle after a lon period of time at least for me it was. It seems like these would fit a child much better than an adult so much so I actually had to go back to the listing and check if these were kid headphones/headset.

5th. issue issue which in my case was the worst issue I had. There is so much bass being cranked out of these things! If you want to listen to music on them like rap or hiphop then these things are going to sound amazing but if you are playing a multiplayer game where you need to hear footsteps or something like that then you are in for a surprise! You can hardly hear any of the higher tones so all the important sounds are so muffled as if you are using really cheap headphones, cheaper than airplane ones that hardly make contact with your ear where there is a gap in between. I tried them for a bit and when there is an explosion, you feel like you had your head inside a car with some huge sub woofers and it basically drowns out all the other sounds till the bass reverb is gone. Over all these were not worth the money for me... I am kind of bummed out because they look nice and build quality was pretty good along with no stupid cable to deal with so I was really hoping they turned out better. I would even pay more for this same pair if it had bigger ear cushion rings and different frequency tones but I don't know if they make a good pair that fits all my needs.

I will say that other than all the issues i mentioned, the design is pretty nice. The mic folds up really nice and bends in so you can get it pretty close to your mouth... The buttons on the side were decent also. Overall they look and feel good in the hand but the bass and lack of higher tones was the deal breaker for me.",1.0

Add to this is the games mind numbingly boring combat scheme that makes dragon age feel like call of duty, and the ridiculously jacked up money/store system.

"First I want to say that I am a huge baseball fan, and that WSB 2K1 was completely underrated and 2K2 is equally overrated. 2K1 had hands down the BEST GRAPHICS I've ever seen in a sports game. The pitching and batting of all players was right on the money, a perfect 10. Full motion, breaking pitches looked so sharp, you could even see the seams! While the fielding was automatic, the plays looked realistic and had full motion and extreme detail. The editor was fabulous too, although I wouldn't mind changing the height and weight too! It's wrong to call 2K1 a failure (an example of failure would be all 3 baseball games on PS2), because if only the fielding were changed to manual, that would have been the greatest game of all time. Meanwhile in 2K2, I lost hope. To start, the graphics aren't even close to 2K1, pitching and batting motion is strange, even cartoon like. Also, pitches don't break AT ALL- a fastball looks just like a screwball. Batting stances aren't correct (especially Bonds), and balls outside the strike zone are still strikes. To continue, yes, you have manual fielding, but a normal 6-4-3 double play is almost impossible, because it seems as though everyone is as fast as Maurice Green. Plus the fielders dive way too far, but at least they can jump. To add to that, the editor is [weak] too. You can't even change the faces, pitching stance, or batting stance, so it's all a clone team. Then to top that off, as the GM (who's suppose to have control) can't even trade half the people you want to because of NO TRADE contracts. That's poor. Hitting is far too difficult, and in 2 player mode, you can't even hide your pitch. The only pluses I can give are exceptional commentary, online play, and home run derby.

"I have always been of the opinion that TreyArch don't know what they are doing.  This is the third game they have disappointed me with.  I have always found their game movement worthless.  The last game I tried was either BO1 or 2, and I couldn't get over the terrible player movement with the sound effect that sounded like the soldier was wearing tap shoes.

But I had some time off work and thought I'd give this a shot.  Wow.  What a mistake and waste money.

About the only thing that impressed me was that during the game they changed the LED color on my controller.

While my PS4 took an hour to install the multi player option (which is mainly what I play) I tried the free running mode that let me get used to the new running along a wall concept, which is the big idea for this game.

Finally I was able to try a multi player game.  Not only did it completely suck in every way, but there were various defective game scenery areas that made it look like a buggy beta.  Some vehicles and bits of scenery were invisible, so you'd just run into see through walls now and then.

I didn't like the weapons, player movement, aiming, the map designs, absolutely nothing about the game was any good.  And I say this as someone who has spent days playing various previous versions of the Sledgehammer / Infinity Ward reaching top prestige level on multiple titles.

The whole game was a total mystery to me.  Spawning right next to enemies who promptly kill you.  Poor balance of team skill levels.  Endless UAVs.  And just woeful graphics and movement.

But perhaps the most laughable part of the game was the horrific voice acting.  It was like it was design by and for a mentally disadvantaged 12 year old.  The first game I was on the losing team of I was told by one of the cartoon like characters, ""You better f***ing bring it next time...""

I played the game for less time than it took to download and install and promptly deleted it.  What utter garbage.  I will NEVER buy another TreyArch game again.  They are just cashing in on the Call of Duty franchise name, because they know people will buy it for the name.

I cannot imagine why anyone would prefer this over other vastly superior Call of Duty games you can choose from.",1.0

"...
The first thing that I found annoying about this game were the controls.  Most games I play have the A and X buttons for punching and kicking.  This had B and Y. Also, you must press the right joystick in any direction to toggle between first person mode.  Isn't it a waste of a joystick to use it as a toggle button.  To look around in first person mode, you must go back to the left joystick.  Also, you cannot move your character in first person mode.  I needed to move slightly sideways to get someone in the crosshairs, but I had to go out of first person mode, move, then go back into first person mode.
I also thought the ""Fire"" button was not very intuitive.  Additionally, when you are playing Ghost in the driving mode, you only have to worry about three controls.  That being the case, they still decided to change what you use as the ""Fire"" button.  Why not keep it consistent with what was used in the non-driving modes?
I like games that help you escape into the world of the game.  I don't like to feel like I am playing a monotonous arcade game.  With ""Enter the Matrix"", I felt like I was playing an arcade game.  At one point, you couldn't drive through the wooden gate arms at a toll booth.  Instead, the game told you to survive for 2 minutes, then the gates would open.  Oh yeah, I could see that happening in the movie.  Yeah, right.
I did like the ""Focus"" feature which allowed you to go into ""Bullet time.""

"After playing Dirt, I could hardly wait to get into this game.
I prefer realism and realistic cars and driving. What this is is
another excellent example of what's wrong with the racing genre.

 THE GOOD:
  Graphics, sounds, detail, cars (interior and exterior)
  Menu System

 THE BAD:
  Virtually unplayable with driving aids turned off
  Pedal sensitivity and feel , even with saturation turned down
  Steering lag
  Bump-n-Grind (The other cars smash each other (and you) around
  the track like a demolition derby!)
  Narrator in your ear all the time (very annoying)
  Car slides around like it was on ice, can burnout from a standstill
  in 4th gear!
  The AI cars don't slide like you do, they grip all the way through
  the turn!

  After Dirt, I thought the same company would nail the driving in this game.
I have other racers (Indianapolis 500, Race Pro, Forza2) that are far more
realistic than this game is. In those games it's your driving that makes
the difference, not how many ""cheats"" you have turned on. I guess if you like
playing with that stuff, you'll like this game just fine. If you're looking for
more realism, though, more sim,I suggest you look elsewhere. I agree with another

"My review could be an exact copy of what J. Tyson wrote on August 17:

 enjoyed playing this game up to the point it becomes impossible. How is this? It started in Dragast, the second stage of the game. The first puzzle I encountered was visually blocked out by green and white vertical lines that cover the entire screen. I thought maybe this was an isolated problem. I was able to get by this one puzzle referring to a walkthrough (kind of ruins it for me). The very next puzzle had a similar problem. I contacted Dreamcatcher and was given a patch to download and install that was supposed to fix the problem. No such luck. I have since been requested to provide some information from my pc and I am waiting for a response. This problem occured with two separate sets of disks. Only some of the puzzles are affected. I think the graphics are great and would love to be able to play this game minus the problems

"Too much deception here.  Why wait for a package to ship me a code? Not a single mention of the file size.  Most sites actually are hiding the file size.  It's 3.2 GB.  So in memory card standards that's about $12-$15 worth of memory.  So yeah the game is cheap but factor in the needed memory.  Been a fan of the series, desperately trying to find vita games to play and it's been a pain.  A lot of trickery and deception on sonys part with the mandatory memory cards and digital only games.  If you splurged and got a sick memory card like 32gb s or better than I guess it's not a big deal but the whole process leaves me a bitter taste.  NOTE- I have not actually played this game.

"I could not complete the first level of the game.  I got all of the tools available on the first level and used the tools but could not get the doors open. I looked online for clues and saw that a ghost appears that the tools had to be used on in order for a door to open that leads to the next level of the game.  I used the tools exactly as I saw online but the ghost never appeared.

I bought the game used and it did not come with a manual.  I do not know if a manual gives clues on how to complete each level but waiting for a ghost to appear to complete the first level took the fun out of the game.  All we could do on the game is walk from one room to another room.

"After AC4, the AC series took a serious nosedive and this entry is a perfect example of the ongoing low quality of the newer titles. The story lines have gotten oh-so-inane and the characters -- especially their dialogue -- seem like they've been created for three-year-olds. But we don't play games like this for the story, we're looking for realistic action, and this game misses that target big time. Instead of stressing actual battle characteristics, the developers have created impossible situations (really, flying aircraft carriers?) that simply do not engage the player. The graphics are fine but the incredibly goofy missions just make this game look silly, and the sheer implausibility of the situations (a plane with a payload of 125 missiles?) make AC6 a throwaway. The uneven degree of difficulty of opponents creates frustration because you don't know from one mission to the next whether you'll be battling nitwits or supermen. I would advise all but the under-eight crowd to avoid this game.",1.0

"I am an ORIGINAL OG gamer from pong to space invaders and have played alomost every one of this series and I will tell you bluntly this is a WASTE of money. The so called people responsible for this trash should be banned from ever working on any form of digital entertainment again and whats shocking is the NEW one is EVEN WORSE!!! The game has NOT changed since 1994 and in fact the original was way more fun as it had more jumps, cars, interesting things happening. This 2015 edition is boring, broken and lame. Few cars same lame boring tracks that have been in every NFS since Carbon Canyon, and the same BRAINDEAD traffic that has NEVER added anything to this series nor will it EVER add anything. The programmers are so bad that IF you finish the base game (which isn't hard or especially fun) you can participate in their ""elite"" challenges. In this instance I will use a form of race called ""touge"" which is fast drifiting, like most there are 3 levels of achievement bronze, silver, and gold. They give you a base number to hit in this case 425,000 for bronze, 550,000 for silver and 675,000 for gold but what these morons did was NOT program their AI with a cap which means IF you manage to get 675,000 drift points (a good achievement for sure) you MIGHT NOT get the gold because the programmers have deemed it that the AI cars MUST be in front of you and will wreck you to get there (thus taking away points AND stopping your drift chain) AND they will get MORE points than you so you don't get the achievement since they don't have that cap!
Does ANY of this sound like fun or good programming???

You don't interact with charecters really at all.  the only times you even see other charecters is once when a man comes in babbling nonesense, or at the end where the story still didn't make sense.  things dissapear from your invetory and don't like to reappear.  i had to start the game over three times.  The puzzles are illogical and HARD.  I was constantly looking for cheats.  my opinion: this game is not worth two cents!",1.0
"I rented this because of the comparison to Oblivion on the back. Now I want to the guy who wrote that deceitful review and find out how much he was paid for it.

I returned it the very next morning. I'd put maybe fifteen minutes into it the night before, and ejected it in disgust.

This game pretends to have character customization. It'll let you shorten or lengthen your character's arms and legs, and give him muscles. That's about it. Oh, you can change hair color. There are a couple styles, but they all pretty much look alike. And that's it.

I thought maybe it would redeem itself--after all, Fable could be rather linear but it was great--but when I watched the first cutscene I groaned. It was terrible. I could tell someone spent all of five minutes on it before shoving the product on the shelves in the hope of making a few bucks before gamers caught on. The characters looked wooden and the voice acting was the worst I've heard in years. The writing was almost as bad. Imagine characters who sound like they're reading words off a medical chart while going out of their way to sound medieval.

Example:

""Hail, my lord! Art thou the bounty hunter that wast summoned by mine village elder?""
""Aye, that be I. Where be thy village elder that I mighte speakethe with himeth?""

And so on and so forth. It's friggin' painful. And the subject matter is so incredibly generic I can't...actually, that about does it: incredibly generic.

In the first dungeon--which I think is supposed to be a tutorial--I encountered two enemies. The first in the game! Ask any gamer--the first enem(ies) a game throws at you are always set up to be impossible to lose to. The game just wants you to get your feet wet, test the controls.

Not here. I died seven times trying to kill the first enemies in the game. Two hits from them was enough to kill me. It was like the game accidentally dropped me in the final dungeon instead of the first.

Finally I managed to kill them. I don't know how, because the controls are so loose it's nigh impossible to keep your crosshairs on the target. Pure luck, and lots of respawning nearby. Oh, I forgot to mention that--that's six or seven deaths with my cumulative damage still on those two baddies. If this was a foreshadow of the kind of ridiculous imbalance I'd see later on, it was a bad, bad sign.

My next challenge was opening a locked gate. I found my lockpicks on the menu (the horrible, horrible menu) but couldn't figure out how to use them on the gate.

The menu graphics look like they were imported directly from a Sega Genesis. It's half impossible to tell what things are in your inventory, and all of the menu commands are counterintuitive--except looting. I figured out how to use potions. That was a major victory.

This game pretends to be like Oblivion--hence that schmuck's comparison I mentioned--in that there's an overworld with several locations you can find and explore. Also, you can buy a horse. And that about does it for those similarities--but I had to mention them, because the game throws them in your face.

I'm very glad I only rented this and didn't purchase it. If I had, I would've demanded my money back.

Quick check what's good about this game, the idea.  What's decent about this game, the sound and the graphics.  What's bad about this game, everything else.  The controls are horribly clunky, the melee attack is more powerful than bullets(but at least you have forearms the size of Buicks), a cutscene every 2 seconds, you get the world's wimpiest gun on a mission against zombies and megazombies and they have successfully created the world's most idiotic and annoying assistant.

The most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name.

"Well, as a fan of the dynasty warriors series, I'm up for any type of hack and slash.  However, this is a HUGE disappointment.  If you are new to the hack 'n slash genre, I could see this being a fun game.  It just does not compare, the game slows down a lot (even with the bad graphics), only has 3 characters and the moves are just OK... not enough variety.

When I think about Dynasty warriors and how much variety it has, this game really is just trying to pull the 'sex sells' act and spend a month throwing together a game and put 'bikini' in the title because they know it cannot compete with it's peers.

The game can be fun if you haven't experienced others in its genre.  But it is short, the game has little replay value with only 3 characters (compared to near 100 in some games), and overall any comparison you make to any other recent game in the genre is basically terrible.

"NOT A STANDALONE GAME?? I've had Sim City 2000, Sim City 4 Deluxe, recently got back into playing these types of games (Tropico, Port Royal, etc.) couldn't find my disk for Sim City 4, didn't even KNOW a ""new version"" had come out. Saw ads for Cities XXL via ""Steam"" (evidently far superior) but really don't WANT nor see any reason for online/multiplayer interaction for a game like this via a subscription based internet/cloud account and game server. Even the guy at the big box store I purchased this from, when I asked about the ""dedicated internet connection required"" he SWORE that he owned the game himself, and while initially it required the dedicated connection, I could NOW play the game without. NOT TRUE!!!!

TOO anxious for the latest and greatest version of one of my all-time favorite games to research reviews until after I'd purchased, and guess what? ALL the reviews are horrible due to the exact reasons I hate it!

You HAVE to install ""Origin"" (like ""steam"" an online game server app-think of games like Xbox live or Wizard 101) and set up an online account/profile in order to get the game??? I don't WANT to play with other people, I want to build and work on MY city myself, just like in Sim City 4. I want to be able to play even if my internet is down (as would anyone wanting to play the game who doesn't have high speed internet to begin with).

So, I was already angry, but gave in and started jumping through hoops (opting NOT to let Origin run at startup,collect offline data, etc. =the default settings). Loaded everything, clicked on ""Play"" via the Origin ""my games"" tab (internet based), nothing happened AT ALL. I have a Windows 7 pc, Phenom quad core processor, 8 gb ram, 2mb dedicated graphics, high speed internet, NO reason it should'n't have launched. Clicked the ""task manager"" and guess what? The ""Origin"" app itself was hogging over 93 mb of resources, and Sim City (trying to launch) only took 63mb, but COULDN'T launch due to ""Origin"" (or the game servers). This is why every single review of the product says to avoid it at all costs-servers crash, and performance is hindered because of being an internet based game.

I finally got it to launch after a few attempts, then, after nearly a half an hour of 'updating', a few restarts, it finally worked! Well, since the game is internet based and they do a test to adjust your settings, I pretty much ended up having the same graphics I had with Sim City 4, albeit *slightly* smoother and no more funky, intertwined roads. Doing the tutorial, I did discover that you apparently no longer need to do all the manual placement of underground water or power lines, which is a plus, I guess?

While I've just started playing, but due to the game lag, and my graphics quality all 'automatically adjusted' to ""LOW"" by Origin (thus giving me the same graphics Sim City 4 had, or at least only very slightly better) while I've been anxiously looking forward to playing, I gave up halfway through the tutorial. I know that's not fair, but it's true. This will be uninstalled and go in the ""forget"" pile (Like Port Royale 3 did) and I'll dig out my version of Sim CIty 4 again.",1.0

"So, to start off with a comparison, Dragon Age: Origins was one of the better games I have ever played; not so much for polished graphics or even exceptional game-play, but for the acting, witty dialogue, and compelling storyline.  The voices were extremely well done, and true-to-life believable.

Morrigan oozed potent sensuality with every word, but could turn on a dime with biting sarcasm.  Alistair's combination of loyalty, humor, and innocence were perfectly portrayed in his character's tone and timing.  Sten came off exceptionally well as the seemingly emotionless giant who was both teased to embarrassment by Leliana's coy playfulness, and secretly driven mad with desire by Morrigan's enthralling beauty.  Zevran was by far the quickest and easiest lay in the game, and his Hispanic accent and lover boy charm were in no way overacted.  Shale [spoiler alert] screamed ""flaming homosexual"" with every nuance of speech and every fretful concern over fashion, until you found out he was a she.

It seemed as if every character was portrayed with Oscar-potential acting.  The dialogue was witty even while being a bit juvenile; it had a sharp comedic edge, yet often a surprising sensibility.

Now for the horror that is Dragon Age: Inquisition.

Whenever I see an entertainment industry product so poorly done, I cannot help but ask myself, WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE THINKING?

This is - BY FAR AND AWAY - the most artistically repulsive work of software fiction I've ever witnessed.  As other reviewers have noted, the shimmering, plasticine hair will drive you to absolute distraction, and make you want to pull out your own hair so you don't have to ever look at hair again.  HAIR, HAIR, HAIR!

Try to imagine - if you dare - melting a giant ball of plastic, placing the disgusting goop on top of someone's head so that it molds perfectly into a hair-like structure, and then, once it hardens to an immoveable, globulous mass, polishing the already bright helmet to the point that it outshines ALL other objects in the game, and that even the slightest movement bombards your eyes with a multitude of light flashes from the top of every character's head - EVEN THE BALD ONES!

I'm not sure how much worse it could get, but here's the ironic part: in some of the cut scenes, the hair is normal.  That tells me the shiny shine-shine is a disturbing attempt at some sort of extreme artistic device, but in truth it comes off as being derived from the never-ending war against consumer attention deficit.

Anyway, the rest of the game is equally atrocious in combat and looting mechanics, NPC interactions, story lines, dialogue, and, worst of all, voice acting.  These can all be summed up in two words: patently awful.  Not to mention that Inquisition is ABSOLUTELY an unfinished product, loaded with glitches.

I will add that you should take game's epilepsy warning seriously.  The game-play is so clunky (as other reviewers have said) and jerky that after playing about 8 hours over the course of 3 days, my vision seemed to be adversely affected.  I don't believe this is a frame rate issue, as I have a reasonably fast computer, and I tried all levels of graphic settings, to no avail.

It really never crossed my mind that the developers could $%^& things up THIS BAD.  What a fantastic disappointment.

Here are a few more examples of how this game is an abomination in every way.

Loading freeze:
So you start the game and get to the main menu.  You click on the top selection, ""Continue"", and nothing happens.  You click again.  You hit escape.  You close the annoying Origin DRM window.  You click the big red X (if in Windows platform, and in windowed mode). Doesn't matter - you're frozen.  This happens maybe once every five or six loads.  Task Manager is your only option.  By the way, you CANNOT play Inquisition without Origin up and running.  Yet another irritation, as if this game needed more.

Combat:
So you're getting slaughtered early in a battle, but you can't figure out why.  Three members of your party are all but dead, while a fourth remains healthy as a horse.  Well, that's because he or she got stuck a couple hundred yards away on a piece of rock about 1/8-inch tall.  Oops.

Looting:
So you go to pick up some loot.  You're a few feet away?  Okay, go walk over to it.  Still not close enough?  Stand on top of it.  Still can't pick it up?  Oh wait, that's because you're not FACING the loot.  Silly me, I didn't know my brain-dead character was spatially challenged.  Very much UNLIKE Origins, where, if you could click on it, your character would have the sense to WALK over to it, even from relatively far away, and turn THEMSELVES in the proper direction.  Imagine that. Dragon Age II made looting even easier, with an ultra fast keyboard shortcut.  Congratulations, BioWare; you've reversed almost 6 years of RPG progress, not to mention two major iterations of your own product.

Artwork:
So about 90% of the graphic design - everything from walls to grass to rock to skin to clothing - has almost as much shimmer as the disastrous hair.  At first glance, it looks as though the entire kingdom endured a recent hurricane, and everything is still wet.  I heard a calumnious rumor that the game's illustrators were orangutans hired at 5 bananas per day.  I can neither confirm nor deny its veracity.

Climbing and jumping:
So you're walking along, and there's a small hill you need to climb.  It's tiny, not even as high as your ankle.  But your character stubbornly refuses to move forward.  So you jump.  And.............................. that's it.  You hover in mid air with your knees up to your chest. Permanently.  You can look at the world around you (ooh, more shininess!!!).  You can switch characters.  You can look at your inventory, your map, your journal, etc.  Doesn't matter - the jumper stays jumped.  Hope you saved recently.

Ambient Dialogue:
So you're tooling along, minding your own business, when you hear prepubescent sparring between party members.

Iron Bull: ""Hey, that was some nice work back there, with that shield bashing.""

Cassandra: ""And you as well.""

Iron Bull: ""Are you as turned on as I am right now?""

Cassandra: ""Huh?""

Iron Bull: ""That's probably impossible anyway.""

Okay, so we're all back in 6th grade, and little Tommy gets really excited when the bigger boys make lewd comments about ""it"".  He doesn't understand these things yet, but they make him all hot and bothered.

"I loved the first game.  It was complicated enough without being so complicated that I wasn't able to complete it.  I also enjoyed the first game's storyline as well.  This game though, I really wanted to like it.  I was hoping for the best, that's not what I got.  Maybe I'm just not a first person shooter kind of gamer.  That could be it.  I got to a point that I tried to get myself through for two days.  This was in chapter 7 of the game, right after finishing off the snipers, when your trying to get down to the street.  There was no way to get through this situation, at least no way that I could think of.  I tried various weapon uses.  Didn't really help.  I tried using a walkthrough.  Did not help.  I tried an easier mode, all the way to Easy mode, and I still could not get through this section of  the game.  For me though if I can't get through a section for two days, then I realize the game isn't for me.  That's a true disappointment.  I was hoping for a lot, but I got a huge let down.

"I read the reviews prior to purchase and still decided to give it a go despite some apprehension.  What everyone is complaining about is not far off at all and really does ruin the overall experience.  It took over 4 hours to get the game installed (one year old Macbook Pro) since STEAM, the flaming pile of !#@$ that it is, required five updates.  This was an active process, not me leaving the computer somewhere for four hours to let it update.  I had to sit there watching it because the updates would drop out as they were downloading and STEAM would say I wasn't connected to the internet.  I finally got everything updated (STEAM, mind you, not the game), updated the GAME for another 20 minutes, and started playing.  The game is Civilization-esque.  I guess they decided to make a bunch of changes so it wasn't just Civ 4.2.  The complaints about unit movement are spot on.  Frustrating pain in the @$$.  Defenseless units (catapult, cannon) will be easily overrun since there is no way to stack units and defend on all fronts.  City management seems to be lacking in some critical areas (why can't I sacrifice production to make citizens happy?  And why are they still unhappy when I've built EVERY building that should make them happy!?), but overall, the game still retains the Civilization feel.  So there's three stars for fun (it would have been four stars if the game wasn't so painfully slow).  Why one star, overall?  STEAM has effectively turned my Macbook into a brick that I want to throw out the window.  I switched to Mac a few years ago to get away from the general pain in the ass that is Windows OS.  Things crashing.  Programs not responding.  I wanted a laptop that I could boot up and be surfing the web within a minute.  So I buy Civ V, download STEAM like a good little idiot, and wa-la.  I now am the proud owner of a crappy PC.  Boot up takes forever.  When my home screen pops up, guess what is automatically *trying* to run?  Good ol' STEAM.  So I force quit STEAM (cuz regular quit won't work, of course), and click on Safari.  4-5 minutes later and I've made it to my facebook profile page.  I quit Safari and guess what's running again?

"I have played Fifa year after year since 2010 on the PS3. FIFA 13 was so much fun on the PS3 that i could not wait to get my hands on the next gen version of FIFA on the PS4. Soon as you get into the menu you think to yourself, hmmm there is some stuff missing. (which i am sure most of you have read about already) But i overlooked it because i was so excited to start playing.

I didn't complain about the lack of game modes because the game does look pretty good. The graphics are pretty awesome, i'll give them that. But the GAMEPLAY, the part that actually matters? IS HORRIBLE !

The controls and movement is sooooo clunky. At first i blamed it on the new PS4 controllers. But as i played other games on the PS4 i know there is no way the controllers are to blame. it has to be the new engine they used. It feels like I am playing a game on the PS1. I am surprised that not many reviews mention this. Clunky controls aside, the AI and passing is even worse.
EA took 10 steps back with this game, I honestly think this will be the last FIFA game i purchase from EA Games. Probably the last EA game i purchase, Period. I'm fed up with them. PES 2015 here i come",1.0
"I was so pysched to have gotten this game set for Christmas and immediately loaded it to play... which is where my problems have begun.  I've installed and reinstalled Gothic 1 multiple times now in an attempt to get it to work... but to no avail.  I continue to receive an access violation when starting up Gothic 1.  You need to be aware that the issues I'm having are VERY VERY common and as of yet, I've not found anywhere on the internet that has a workaround.  To top it off, Piranha Bytes is unreachable for support and Dreamcatcher has yet to respond after a week and 2 seperate emails.  **EDIT: Dreamcatcher never responded to any of my attempts to reach them.  After 4 months, I'm going to assume they have no intention of doing so.  Very frustrating because what little I've been able to play of Gothic 2 (the game is almost unplayable due to the insane increase of difficulty with the expansion) I'm sure I would have throughly loved all 3 games.**

So please, PLEASE, before you buy this product, do a search on the web for ""Gothic Access Violation"" and see how completely common it is to buy a broken game.  This is COMPLETELY unexcusable in my opinion and truly hope to save someone else the money that we have wasted on this.",1.0
I bought these headsets assuming I would be getting the  latest version 1.5 based on the product description. I received the older version and I am sending these back.

"I am giving this one star. First off, the product is definitely not worth is new item price. It's flimsy, it smelled weird when I initially opened the product, and it is extremely uncomfortable. My ears hurt and get sore after just a mere couple of hours using them. The Bass is downright terrible, basically non existent. Volume is barely high, and for some reason the wiring had issues to keep consistent audio feed to the headset. It just kept cutting out time and time again. I thought this was a good brand but it turns out I was wrong. How they get away with the price they have these at is just robbery. Find a different set besides these. Their are cheaper headsets out their that are way better than these pair of ear sores.",1.0

"I can't believe Square Soft put out a game with game play and a storyline as lame as Vagrant Story.  The battle commands are unwieldy and  time-consuming, and the dialog balloons are rather childish and  distracting.  Granted, some of the effects and characters are neat, but I  have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence.  After  that, it's a disappointment for experienced gamers.  I played the game for  about three hours until I couldn't stand it anymore, thinking I would get  used to it, but I just didn't like it.",1.0
"Let's see what makes this a BAD game, shall we?

  1. ""Commentary""
  A commentary is when two guys are sitting at a table near the ring, and talk about some stuff OTHER than the current match.  Tazz and Cole's so-called ""commentary"" is laughable and repeats the same phases.  Tazz and Cole are emotionless and sound like computers that need to find an acting coach.  They sound like this: There will be no interferring in the....single match.
  2. What the hell are they chewing on?!
  EVERY character in this game looks like they're chewing tobacco or something.
  3.  Auto-Lock, Please!
  I've played WWF No Mercy for the N64, and it had a clever little system.  Everytime you get it, your character would turn towards the character that hit you.  WWF Smackdown! doesn't have an auto-lock on.
  4. Create a Character
  Okay, this is one of the stupidest systems for creating a wrestler.  You don't get to pick any of the moves, just looks and clothing.
  5.  NO EASY SETTING!!
  WWF Smachdown! is HARD and doesn't appear to have a ""easy"" setting.  The computer is relentless and doesn't leave you alone to recover from the last attack.
  6. LOOKS

  Some characters don't look like the wrestlers in the real WWF.  For example, Stone Cold. 'nuff said.

  7. Nobody Talks!
  The only two who talk are the computerized voices of Tazz and Cole.
All in all, this is the worst wrestling game ever made.",1.0

"You may all hate me for such a short review, but you know, I hate that I still have to play Madden 12, because: 1) They've monopolized the player licensing, so they can come up with a crappy product year after year.  2)  It's the newest game with the Franchise Mode, still in tact.  3)  It doesn't freeze.
I loved Madden, for years.  Allot of fun, good times playing with the kids, and building a crummy team, into a champion by draft, and free agency.
If I wanted to, I could even make a QB, who was a 60, a 99 if I saw fit.  Hey, for $60.00, I should be able to do whatever the heck I want.
The graphics are marginally better, the game freezes, and the main draw to the game for me, personally has been taken away.  Nice.  No other gaming company, other than EA, has taken a Franchise mode out of any sports game before.  Leave it to these jack asses to have ruined this game, for allot of people.
I'm probably not in the majority here, but, there are allot of people who just want to play a game, without all the online bs, quitters, whiners, and honestly are 10 times better than the average Joe, like me, but play us, or my kids, to, ""Brush up.""

"As far as I can tell, as of 11/23/09, this game seems to be dropping off significantly in terms of population, at least on my server.  Personally, I credit this to inability or unwillingness on the part of the game developers/operators (NCWest) to

  1. Balance the two races such that meaningful PvP can occur.  As it stands now, being an Asmodian is a constant series of losing battles where you are outnumbered at least 2 to 1.  I would imagine that some might enjoy being on the other side (the Elyos) and slaughtering other players with no effort, but such is not for me.

  2. Bots (characters controlled by software, with no one actually at the keyboard) are rampant, almost completely uncontrolled by GM's (Game Masters), simply because there is very little GM presence in the game.  I suspect that since GM's need to be paid at least some salary, their numbers are kept low.

  3. Kinah (game money) sellers (usually closely aligned with bots) not only broadcast in the chat channels, and send you private messages, they camp right in front of the brokers.  Again, GM enforcement of the rules against this is almost nil, which causes any respect for the other rules (Terms of Service) to evaporate.

  4. The logic for gaining XP (Experience Points, which drive the advancement of your character) is such that, at least in the general player opinion, grouping with other players is actually detrimental.  Almost everyone solos.  Expect a lonely first few weeks of play, until you have achieved the crucial level 25, at which point grouping becomes more necessary to survival.

  5. Last, but not least, the chat channels (especially the critical LFG (Looking For Group)) have been taken over, generally, as a teen chat channel, full of obscenities, racism, anti-semitism, and references to illicit substances and adult activities.  Yet again, no GM oversight.  I have encountered some mature, reasonable people in groups, but not many.  I do not recommend that parents permit children under 18 to play this game.

In short, the better-known World of Warcraft has nothing to fear from Aion Online.  I expect it to soon go the way of other MMORPG failures, such as Age of Conan, Vanguard, or Everquest II.",1.0
"I've played all parts of Civ from the first one over Civilization Revolution for consoles to this one. But the 5th part of the series is the worst of all. It is a castrated version of Civ.

- Where is the wonder Darwins Voyage?
- No spies
- No pollution/health
- No religion (therefore improperly Bible quotes, no quotes of other religion)
- Less wonder and technologies than in the other parts (nearly the half)
- No trade with technologies.
- No trade with maps. (therefore you have also in the last part of the game a lot of fog on the map / And no satellite images)
- No colonies.
- Units can now ""swim"", no transport ships are necessary.
- When you click on the next turn button, you can make and drink a cup of coffee. You can wait 30-60 seconds every turn!!!
- Cities grow slowly and the people are never satisfied.
- You need for playing really a state of the art PC. (different from other strategy games like Starcraft 2)
- No types of government.
- And last but not least. No WONDER VIDEOS.

"There are several things wrong with this game
Squad AI and enemy AI: This basically kills the game. The squad AI is so bad, the squad is a liability rather than an asset. Squad members will run out in front of you and block your shot, refuse to stay put when you tell them too, refuse to maintain distance and will therefore attract splash damage to you because they run up next to you, stand out in the open and just shoot away. The way the controls are set up, squad-mates are unnecessarily hard to issue orders to. For example, the game forces you to use a 'Biotic' power to destroy certain enemies. If you're a soldier you don't have access to these powers, so you have to use a squad-mate. To do so, you must have line of sight to the enemy that you want your squad-mate to destroy. WHY? How does this make any sense whatsoever? Why not just let the player switch control between characters like most RPGs of the 'recruit your squad-mates' variety do? Enemy AI is very primitive. While they us cover, it's very sparingly and they never do anything other than hold position or duck and weave between different cover. No grenade usage, no assault, nothing. BORING!
Sticky walls: ME1 decided to go with the '3rd person shooter duck and lean' system popularized by Gears of War. While it may work well on a console, here it's just annoying - you repeatedly stick to any bit of wall that you run into and un-sticking yourself is not smooth but you sort of have to pull yourself away. It's very annoying.
The Car & Mineral Collection: It's no fun to drive (in fact, it drives terribly and is very very aggravating) and they turn resource collection into a boring drive across empty terrain. If you don't do this, you can't buy the good stuff. So you just have to explore scores of worlds, driving across maps to find minerals. It's all very irritating and boring after the first time. The fact that this has to be done many many times made me decide to drop the game and stop playing it.
The BIOWARE recipe: Here's how it works - reveal a terrible calamity to the player. Have him move around the world collecting companions and harvesting resources by giving him boring, semi generic missions (the missions are basically identical between games. Try playing Dragon Age & KOTOR 1 alongside ME1 and you'll see what I mean). When he becomes Uber Powerful, lock him into a channeled sequence of events which culminates in him killing the boss in a (usually boring and repetitive shoot out so many body parts type) boss fight. We went there and did that with KOTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age 1 & 2 and I hope by now people realize just how absolutely standardized all Bioware games are and how ME 1 stays true to this generic pattern.

In the end, my suggestion is to pass this game over in favor of more interesting titles.",1.0
"For the most part I enjoyed this game. I gave it a rating of 1 star to get your attention and to point out that this is only HALF a game. It offers both single player and online multiplay.
If you love multiplayer games and have a broadband connection...this game is awesome. WARNING - Most of the Halo Multiplayer servers, groups and games I played were filled with immature 14 year olds that curse 4 letter words at you and accuse you of cheating all the time because they can't shoot straight. I prefer more mature surroundings!
If you are looking for a great single player experience...forget it.
First of all the graphics are pretty...but dated. Look at UT 2003 on a high end vid card and compare it to Halo. Halo is bland, the levels are redundant. The outside levels are pretty but nothing impressive.
Even on the hardest settings this game is way too scripted, the enemy AI is pathetic and predictable. It is not intelligent AI. All the programmers did was setup scripted actions and triggers to generate hoardes and hoardes of enemies to come at you at set intervals as you proceed through a level.

Want to beat them easily? Say your in a level exploring...just walk slowly until you trigger some enemies to appear, back track a bit for protection and keep your back to a wall. Kill the enemies as they approach, then step back to where you triggered the enemies, see if you can trigger more and repeat these instructions until you are clear. Proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies. Repeat this strategy throughout the level and the rest of the game.
If you get into a heated, heavy battle, just use cover...pop out, shot some aliens and duck again. They almost never pursue you. Only the weird, mutants chase you. Just shotgun them. Nice and simple.
There are some tiny little parasite style aliens that are more annoying than dangerous. Don't waste your ammo on them, just let them crash into your shield, let your shield recharge and proceed. PIECE OF CAKE. I walked through this game on the hardest settings, without breaking a sweat, the AI is disappointing. Not horrible, but very PREDICTABLE.
Online Multiplay is where this game shines...the weapons are so-so...but having vehicles to drive around is a blast.
If you are thinking of buying this title...I would wait. February 3rd, 2004 is the release of Unreal Tournament 2004.

"I'll start with my summary before anything else: avoid this game at all costs! There's nothing more to it than that.

Now, the question is why? I've played Star Wars Galaxies since launch. It was a fun game. It was one of the best games I've played. There were relatively few bugs, there were quests, and there was an extensive profession system.

There was. Star Wars Galaxies no longer exists. They screwed over their customers after 2 years of gameplay. Expansions were just a means of getting more money before altering the game entirely. You can no longer switch professions, and there are only 9 professions. Jedis are now available to everyone, and they are terrible.

I could continue on, but it only goes downhill from there. Do not buy this game. They just want your money.

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to see what this game is really like now, you need to read the reviews in the Star Wars Galaxies: Starter Kit and ignore the earlier ones here. A lot of these reviews are old, and that is a BIG difference. Had I written this review before October/November, I would have given it praise. If I wrote it before June, possibly 4 or 5 stars. They changed this game OVERNIGHT (In November) and right after everyone preordered the expansion! It was all one big scheme.",1.0

"I rented this game last week...and after putting four hours of my time into it, I discovered that I put the controller down in a worse mood than when I picked it up.

This game is a waste of time. It looks great, but just isn't playable.

The AI isn't capable enough to handle combat...at all. Your party members just walk into the enemy, swing, and die. Blocking is very effective...but your AI party members never do it. You spend over half the time in combat stopping to bring up the menu to heal or revive your allies.

I died three times in the second area of the game as well. Dispersed among the levels are absolutely terrible monsters that will can easily kill your party. The treasure chests attack you. And they annihilate you. They're by far the most difficult enemy in an RPG's early game that I've seen. One hit from them takes off most a character's HP, it can hit multiple characters, and can sometimes attack more than once per animation. The game also scales them up in levels to always be vastly stronger than you, and to top it all off, the game explicitly prevents you from running away from them (the run menu is greyed out when they attack you...) This is completely against the general exploration theme of RPG's...you're supposed to find and open treasure chests, not wonder if the chest contains an item or a practically guaranteed Game Over.

The game also froze once when I was playing it. Interestingly enough, it was when I opened a treasure box...the screen flickered, and just stopped.

"I only purchased this game because I thought it was like the original Sims 2 Castaway but pc version. I found this game lacking compared to the original Sims 2 Castaway. I hate the story mode in this game. It's forced (You have no choice BUT to take in that freakin Orangutan otherwise you can't progress) and there's only one way to play. It was also way too easy to play and I passed it in three days. The sandbox mode with it's ""resources"" as simoleons and the unavailability to gather individual items and make your clothing, tools and cook random yet fun food was dull. In the original Castaway you could make really tasty ""sparkly"" food, gross smelly ""green stinky"" food even ""diarrhea water drop"" food depending on your skill and what recipe you put together. In the original Castaway 2 there were many ways to play it and it felt like an adventure. You don't have that option with this one. Although I love the fact that you can have babies and add custom content that's the only thing great about it. I really hate the fact that with needs are like the needs in The Sims. Every time you get your hunger up your bladder, hygiene, environment and sometimes social are all down at the same time and it's like that with all other needs. As soon as you get one up, most of the others fall down. I also miss the build mode.

Knowing that the developer who created Overlord had made this game too, I was eager to play it. I have never been more disappointed by a videogame. The graphics suck, the controls suck, camera angle is very confusing, the voice acting is abysmal. There is not one redeeming factor to Damnation.
When the game began I was amazed at the lack of attention put into the graphics. This game looks like a super crappy version of GUN from the PS2. The textures are flat and the character models look like they are from an original PSone.
I'm just amazed that a game like this is even released with all the faults that it possess. The current trend is to push back a release date so developers can't work out the kinks and flaws in a game...this game might have benefitted if it had been pushed back a good two years!

"I own the Ghost Edition, which I purchased via a well known game retailer.  I felt compelled to write a brief review on Amazon (my first choice for shopping) of experience with Destiny.

First off, character creation is limited for each character class.  Pretty, disappointing considering this game cost half a billion dollars to develop.  There is 3 looks for the 3 classes.

Secondly, the story is actually really, really short.  And any ""story/universe"" lore that you want to learn or read you can only access via Bungie's website.  Again disappointing.  (Perhaps future DLC, can expand on this miniscule universe that is supposed to be enormous)

Thirdly, the side missions known as ""Strikes"" and ""Raids"", are limited and grow boring after a few runs.

Fourth of all,(something positive) On Xbox One the controls are smooth, the game play is solid and the world's are beautiful.  But feel hollow.  Like a gorgeous frame, with a blank portrait.

Lastly, the MP is completely unbalanced.  It should not unlocked until much later.  Though it claims all weapons are leveled out.  Most users that I have come across feel otherwise.  (Not a blanket statement, just my individual experience and observation).

As far as the actual Ghost Edition is concerned, it is quite nice.  I own several Collector's/Limited Editions and this one is nice.  If you love Destiny like I do not, perhaps this is for you.

My conclusion is that Destiny is undisputedly the most over hyped game of all time.  Can this game become better with future DLC?  In my opinion, nothing can.",1.0

In addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version. I believe that they released this game way to early and I would not buy this product! Save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo on!
STARWARS stamped across the box cannot justify such a terrible game.",1.0
Terrible uninspired game. I managed to trade it in and only lose about a dollar of value.,1.0

UPDATED (5/18/2012)
*******************

I'll keep this review short given that there are 800+ reviews for this game already.

(I have the collector's edition which is why I don't show up as a 'verified purchase')

THE GOOD:
=========

1. Fun to play
It's still fun to play, although it is still the same mindless, hack and slash, quasi-RPG game that the previous two are.

2. Decent presentation
Graphics and sound (music/sound effects/etc) are pretty solid, if uninspired.

3. Isometric view
I am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game, like Bethesda did with Fallout 3.

THE BAD
=======

1. Server ""issues""
'Nuff said.  Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game.

2. Quasi-RPG, with NO CHARACTER BUILDS/CUSTOMIZATION (i.e. LITTLE REPLAY VALUE)
Nothing is permanent, including character 'development'.  By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes (dexterity, strenth, etc.), Blizzard really took out the ""quasi"" in ""quasi-RPG"".  It's actually a straight up action game, with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE.  So absolutely ZERO character customizations.  Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character, because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time.  Don't like your current skills?  Well, just choose another one, they're all available after all!  Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game.

3. Complete Re-hash of Diablo II (i.e. NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME)
This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere.  The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before, as long as you have played D2.  Specifically...

4. Lack of Randomized dungeons (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Everything is in the same location, or so it seems at least.  The continental maps are the same, so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze.  The 'dungeons' (there are actually few dungeons), or locations, all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game.  This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE.  Let's say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is.  No point in ever playing the same class twice, since there is no 'build' anymore for characters.

5. Lack of Atmosphere
It really looks like WoW in an isometric view.  Completely gone is the claustrophobic, disturbing, and foreboding atmosphere of D1.  Everything looks cartoonish, which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill.  Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use.  Don't be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands.  And a coop battle looks like you're at some kind of a rave or Phish concert.

6. Miscellaneous
Bad writing, distracting attempts at humor, very poor voice acting (especially Leah), and tedious intro/cutscenes.

OVERALL:
========
3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

********************
(UPDATED (5/18/2012)
********************

So, I finished the game on 'normal' difficulty and got up to level 31 with my Demon Hunter.  Add a few new ""goods"" and ""bads"" for this game...

GOOD
====

1. Better Cutscenes
The ones at the end are better than the earlier ones (e.g. it's possible to watch it through without hitting ESC).

2. Still Fun (for now...)
Yes, it is still fun to play, despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously.  Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty, I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack(s) comes out.  I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs, which should say something about the casual playability of this game.  Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development, it is still fun to 'unlock' new skills to use.  Much of the fun does derive from leveling (read: grinding) and item collection (who doesn't still love to collect rare, unique, and now legendary items?).

BAD
===

1. Too SHORT!!! (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)
Maybe 15-20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty, and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS.  It's shocking actually, and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2.  For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2, similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1.  But no, there are still just 4 (I think) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete.

2. Lame Bosses/Lairs (i.e. Zzzzzz...)
Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame.  Half of them are just gigantic, bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another.  Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique.  The lairs are similarly boring... most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured.  The boss action, of course, is pure 'grinding' at its finest.  In the later acts, the bosses are almost back to back to back, which to be quite honest got tired really fast, especially when they all seemed the same.

3. Horrible Skill Interface/System (i.e. FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE!)
Yes, the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes (which are not physical items either) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning, and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills.  Fine, let there be a 'cool off' time for switching skills, but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you're not likely to do it in a battle.  So, that means that essentially you're stuck with a half dozen skills, max, at any given time.  This feels very limited and boring, especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun.

4. Linear Gameplay (i.e. GO FROM A > B > C > D...)
More so than D1 or even D2, D3 is super linear.  There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps, and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another, limited your ability to explore.

OVERALL
=======
It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways.  Primarily the lack of character attribute/skill customization (e.g. no 'builds'), the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2, and the small scope of the game.  I couldn't believe that Diablo came so soon, and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something, but alas, it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene.

3/5 for mindless fun
2/5 for overall quality of the game

********************
(UPDATED (5/20/2012)
********************

BOTTOM LINE
===========

So, I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and... I just uninstalled it.  The truth is, the more you play, the higher level you achieve, the less you want to continue playing.  This mostly is a result of the lack of character development/customization (and by that, I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop/specialize skills as in D2) and the overall similarity to D2.  The over-simplication (and let's not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with... hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game.  The bottom line is -- it's just not that fun to play over and over again.  It's also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House, which no normal person would (or could) actually use to try to make money off of the game.  I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay (remember the 'grandfather sword' anyone?) but it's hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game.

In the end, I have to say that while fun for awhile, D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series.  For me, it provided less than a week of gameplay, unlike D2 that I played for months and months.  It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s, and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises.  Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games (e.g. dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal) changes, I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever.  Thank God for Kickstart, which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead (Wasteland 2!!!)...

Final (downgrade) Rating:
2/5 for brief, mindless fun
1/5 for overall quality of the game

*******************
UPDATED (6/1/2012)
*******************

Yes, I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add.

So, I have the collector's edition (completely worth the $100 given all the goodies it comes with), which includes D2/LOD on a USB flash drive.  After uninstalling D3 (after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty), I decided to see how D2 looked and played (haven't played it since 2001, after getting the LOD expansion pack) after all these years.

Well, D2/LOD is still great!  I've been playing for about two weeks (more than twice the time I played D3 for), building a Werebear Druid, and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow-up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal.

MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3
==============================

1. HAND-HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY (e.g. D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD!!)
Yes, the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers.  So, LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY, which other players cannot see let alone pickup.  I mean, how stupid is that?  It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand-holding and 'noob-ification' of this game.

Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls.  What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them, and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town (complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands), right?  And identify scrolls, a RPG staple from the earliest days, well, why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it?

Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations (well, the first time you play through that is, because those locations don't appear to ever change)?  Well, no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO, and if you are close to an important place.  Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps, but nothing even close to this level of hand-holding.  Can anyone really question the noob-ification and extreme linearness of this game?  There's not even an option to turn those map 'hints'/guides off.

Yet another example is the noob-ification of the GEAR REPAIR/durability system.  In D3, items have a durability rating (e.g. 24/24) but that never seems to decrease (or at least, very slowly), despite using your weapons and taking damage.  Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy, so really what was the point?  In D2 (and other RPGs), you fix your gear so that it doesn't break because typically you can't just weld a broken sword back together again!

And of course, don't forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them, instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed.

So, yes -- Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game.  Hell, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding!

2. ABSURD STORY
By now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe-inducing story of D3 (I won't 'spoil' it for those of you who haven't played it yet, but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC).  D2, on the other hand, had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out (if not particularly original) story of the 'Dark Wanderer' (your character from D1), which provides the backdrop for D2.  And don't even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series, Leah...

3. 4-PLAYER CO-OP LIMIT
Eight player co-op games in D2 are great -- too bad you're limited to only four players in D3.  Just stupid.

4. OTHER BATTLE.NET ISSUES
The game creation system for multiplayer co-op has also been simplified, in a bad way.  You can't name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest.  It's very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value (which is not very high to begin with, unfortunately).

5. SILLY D1 'BOSS' CAMEO
Yes, you've all heard the rumors/spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss (arguably the most famous and well-liked boss from the Diablo series) in D3.  No, it makes no sense why this character, who was killed in D1, would return (complete with memorable catchphrase), but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a 'treat' for Diablo fans.  It's not.

6. DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELS
Seriously?  In hindsight, this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting.

CONCLUSION
==========
Don't believe all those 'expert' reviews on the internet, like the mindboggling 100% rating (!!) from Joystiq.  These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree, due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and/or other perks they may receive (e.g. being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks, etc.) that unduly influences their game reviews.  In light of this, it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3.

This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game.  Actually, it's below average.  It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways (gameplay, battle.net, etc.) it is than its predecessor, the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took (12 years, holy smokes!) to finally come out, and because of Blizzard's thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House -- a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree.

Bottom line?  Diablo 3 is fun to play... for a few days.  The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1, so much more engaging to play... and play again and again.  Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game, with deal-breaking noob-ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play.  I would recommend waiting for the inevitable, and likely imminent, price drop before picking this one up.",1.0
"I don't know why everyone likes this game so much.  It was incredibly boring.  Yes, it is as hard as everyone says.  For me, there was absolutely no want for me to try to go farther in this game.  It was very bland and just plain boring.  Nothing special here.",1.0
"I bought these after buying the 800X for XB1. The 800X started out great but the battery started dying to a point that it would not hold a charge. I played my xbox more than PS4 so I used these on my XB until I could figure out a solution to the battery problem and guess what happened? The battery in these completely failed. I've spent the last few weeks searching for replacement solutions on the battery front and nothing seems to be legit. After contacting the company directly and learning that they do not offer any kind of repair service or battery replacement, I'm S.O.L in laymans terms. So I'm out of 2 headsets and $600it seems. A a rational person would think, $300 headset and 3 years of game play, perhaps I got my moneys worth and I should move on right? Wrong! If I spend $300 on a set of headphones, I expect 5 to 6 years at least the lifespan of the console generation that we are in.

I have just recently downloaded the update. I hope it helps. still over all a good game. I would recommend it with a caution.

OK i am extending my review. after four patch downloads and continued bugs I am discusted with the quality to the point i am removing the game from my computer. the folks who released this game should be ashamed for the poor attention paid to fixing the bugs before release. I am done with stalker series games. once a vocal fan; now just disappointed. I do not and will not recommend this game to anyone... waste your money at your own risk.",1.0
"Absolutely horrible!!! Worst, and I mean WORST!! SRPG I have ever played in my entire life. Out of all the SRPG's I have played, this definitely beats the bunch as the worst one. It's quite sad as I am an indie developer and I love many games in the indie scene and I must say, most SRPG's and RPG's in the indie scene are better than this crap and the thing is, they don't even charge much either for their games.

I could make a better game than this honestly. I really don't know where to begin with this one, The opening made no sense, jumped right into a war going on with no explanation, tried to copy Fire Emblem's battle system and failed miserably, characters in the battle animation look like little bobble head toys attacking, character art is bad and the game is just so bland! I only pre-ordered this game because it said it was a decision based game and I love those but this one was not what I had expected. It also came with the bonus soundtrack and Artbook which were not worth it either. Only good thing I can say about this game is the music is decent.

Whatever you do, please do not buy this game! Not even for 5 bucks is this worth anything. I like Aksys because I have played some of their games on the PS Vita so I don't understand how this garbage was published by them. It's disappointing and I love Akysys but the developer of this game sucks. I am definitely refunding this game and can use that money for something better. Like I said, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!",1.0

"So I bought this screen, as well as a new case.  Not sure what I did wrong, but the top screen is displaying a faint green color screen.  Bottom screen works, sound seems to be fine (didn't really check to see if both speakers were working).  So either my main circuit board has a bad ribbon cable connector, or I messed up the screen on my installation (seems easy to mess up trying to work it back through the hinge).  So I tried jiggling around the ribbon cable, seeing if it wasn't seating correctly, no change.  So all I know is that the speakers receive power and so does the screen, but it's doesn't have an image.  I'll buy another screen and see if I can do better the second time around.  If it still doesn't work, guess I'm buying a replacement DS.

Second screen worked, but has a slight greenish tint to the colors.  Maybe something wrong with the DS board of mine, maybe it's the screens from this company.  Not sure.",1.0

"After the hype Disney has given this game over the past several months, I was expecting something really special, and not a Pokemon rip-off as the company had promised.  Well, they got that part right, but not much else.  The game basically consists of you entering a level at one point, randomly digging all over the entire map, then searching for the exit.  There is no online multi-player as the 'Wi-Fi' logo on the box might lead you to believe, only local ad-hoc (that is, once you dig up the randomly placed cube needed to unlock that function).  You also have to locate other hidden cubes to unlock such basic features as say, using the cards that are included in the box.  Who thought up this genius idea?  This is a kid's game!  Another stinging point is no direct control over the Spectrobes themselves, just your main character who dies almost instantly any time he recives damage in a battle.  You can only use the L & R buttons to activate Spectrobes' attacks, while trying to position your player without dying.  This seems like an idea for a new franchise that was ruined by poor planning, or a desire to get the game out before Pokemon Diamond & Pearl.

"In a nutshell: This game was almost completely comprised of high school drama. The plot was weak and most of the characters were weak (with Mel being the only interesting one, and she wasn't used to her full potential), and the puzzles were horrible. I say that because the puzzles all either were ludicrous or they were doing the other students' homework for them. There was on interesting twist, but it was highly implausible. But the biggest problem for me was that it had amazing advertising that had me really pumped to purchase this game, but the game itself couldn't even begin to deliver.

In detail:

We were promised danger. That didn't happen. Well, until the end, but that's a topic all on it's own. We were promised history. What we did get of that was sparse and downplayed in favor of making us make lunches and do other people's homework for them (I should mention that the game is supposed to be set during spring break, and while I know teachers give out homework over spring break, they could have used their time choice as an excuse to do something better with the game). In fact, the 'lunches' were used as an advertising point on the box, which should have been a red flag for me since they advertised it as 'the classic food challenge,' and I find the food challenges (save the bento boxes and the cakes for LouLou in two of their other games) to be completely pointless and extremely annoying.

Lastly, if you look, you'll see a cat on the cover. That doesn't come up at all in the game. And it was an advertising point. Not as an allusion to the villain, but when I read the advertisement, I expected an interesting history of an old academy, it's old headmistress, and her cat. They were advertised, and we only have ONE thing to do with them in the entire game. They opted out of what was interesting to give us high school drama and homework instead. I'm sorry for the people that like this game, but I think that is a huge problem. Just like with Malloy, most of the puzzles could have been scrapped and the game wouldn't have suffered. Actually, it probably would have been better, if only twenty minutes long.

Also, I saw mention somewhere on the HerInteractive site, though I can't remember where, that this was intended to be a scary game, like Message in a Haunted Mansion was 'scary' (that was more of a 'slight tingle of almost-terror' than fear, but it gave the game a really good air). But that right there is a complete BOLDface lie. There is absolutely nothing chilling or scary in this game.

Until the end. Which I will now discuss. It IS kind of gruesome (probably the most gruesome, twist-wise, since Scarlet Hand). But that doesn't make it better. The ending felt like it was slapped on because the makers realized they had nothing left to make the players do. Just like the twist, really, which added NOTHING to the story, but it was really interesting. But with all of the lost potential that was already piling up, they should have done something else rather than take up game time like that.

I really hope they never make such a colossal muck-up again.",1.0
"I assumed that getting this would entitle me to all of the DLC available for the game, the skins are not worth the price and the initiation expansion is good if you like multiplayer, but the three other multiplayer DLCs are not included (Black Mask Challenge Pack, and Deathstroke Challenge pack, and the arkym orgins online supply drop).  I know that it is a season pass and that doesn't necessarily entitle you to all content for a game, but it should give you everything released for at least the next quarter, come on! This game came out in October and its only December, id say its a rip off.  I sure hope that whatever the mystery expansion is feels worth it.  I'd save your money if your on the edge and wait for a PSN sale or a GOTY edition.

"SP: There are enjoyable moments but ultimately I found it more frustrating than fun. It has two of my pet peeves: instant fail stealth missions (Splinter Cell dropped these for a reason) and timed missions where they put a clock on the screen and give you a countdown (it's an artificial way of creating tension). The story is completely forgettable.  When you have your standoff at the end I could only think: who is this guy again? The characters are terrible and the character models in cut scenes are atrocious.  Also there is level where you walk up 15 flights of stairs and do nothing other than listen to the AI complain about walking up the stairs -- brilliant game design!

COOP: Guerilla could be fun but they decided to not include matchmaking which is standard by this point. It's nearly impossible solo and not fun.

MP: So unbalanced. You're either dominating or getting dominated. I made it up to level 45 and I think maybe I played 5 close matches.

Ok I got the first razer product out of the way. My second Razer product was in fact the Onza tournament edition (360 controller). I had to snip the cord and replaced him about 3 separate times while dealing with Razer support. They at least allowed me to that many times.

*Third and final review, this one. The Sabertooth was the last bastion of hope for Razer. I told myself after purchasing, that if this one were defective, I would never buy another Razer product and God as my witness, I will not. Not if my life even depended on it. So what happened with this one you ask? Simply put, an exact month of use goes by, no less the length of the warranty I might add... It works like a breeze. Digital ""sensitivity"" control eliminates those hard to turn knobs sensitivity from the Onza's. Plus and minuses to that which I think led to my Sabertooth freaking out. The ""flat"" design being implimented to the triggers like the Microsoft stock controller eliminated the ANNOYING curved ones on the Onza. That's two steps in the right direction. The two shoulder programmable buttons were made smaller to be able to distinguish from RB and LB. WOW Razer you might have done it...the third times a charm myth might actually prove solid. Now to hit rock bottom, landing back on planet Earth... it freaked out after a month into use. By me using the thumbsticks to move, my character would suddenly ""spazz"" out sort of like my Habu gaming mouse did. It would decide not to respond like when I turn left direction, it basically would not turn my character left. My only reasoning is the digital sensitivity tweaking was causing the malfunction. I used the digital sensitivity like twice though. Non the less, as soon as I saw signs of it being defective, I quickly appealed to amazon and asked how and if they could help me as far as a return or credit for return. Amazon of course was amazing and allowed a refund. I thank you amazon.com for being an amazon-ing (amazing + amazon...haha) site! I wish you, Razer, would fall of the face of the Earth because if you do, GOOD RIDDANCE!",1.0

"I had heard great things about this series and how scary they were, and what a great storyline the Silent Hill series has.  Unfortunately I will never know because I uninstalled it after about 5 hours of ""gameplay.""

I have been playing computer games for 25 years of all types, from Zork, to King's Quest, to FPS games, and without a doubt, this game has the worst movement controls and combat system I've ever seen.  It is incredibly awkward to move, mainly because of the camera angles, which continually change direction. Sometimes the camera will be in front of you facing the character (almost always a terrible position if combat is involved), and sometimes it will switch to a bird's eye view and you wil be staring at the character's head.  Combat is awkward too due to the camera angles.  It's difficult to target certain monsters, and some you won't even know are there until they're right on top of you when the camera is faced forwards.  This just not make for a ""Scary"" gameplay experience, just frustrating.  I hate dying to what appears to be a very easy monster because the camera angle won't easily shift to it.  When the camera is in first person view, response time of the mouse is not very quick (you can't change this, even with your mouse), and trying to use the ""look"" cursor to view objects takes way too long.

In addition to this, the game is slow.  You can run, but combat moves are about half as slow as traditional games (even adventure ones).  And if you die, prepare to have to go through a lot of trouble to get back to your resume point, including having to go through the same cinematic sequences, since the game has very inopportune save points.

I won't be going back to the Silent Hill series without playing a demo of future games first.  This game almost would have been much better as an adventure game instead of an action game.  I'd rather watch the cinematic sequences and try to figure out puzzles than spend my entire time just trying to move around and fight.",1.0
"There are over twenty other reviews of this terrible product, so it isn't strictly necessary for me to add one more, but here goes:

Bought this new at Target for $30 in December.

In mid-January I notice one of my remotes doesn't work anymore. There's a black scorch mark on the battery pack, and it doesn't power on, even with regular AA batteries.

A quick Google search for the manufacturer's phone number reveals that these things are killing Wiimotes all over the place. I contact their customer service to get some satisfaction.

A few days later, they say they'll fix it and replace any damaged remotes if I provide my purchase receipt. Fortunately, I kept it for some reason ... and faxed it to them for the next steps. I get nothing back.

A week later, I nudge them and they email me a UPS return form. I box up the corpses and send them back as instructed in mid-February. I get nothing back.

I nudge them again in early March and get a response that they're working on it and to expect something later in the week. OK, fair enough. 3 weeks later, nothing. I ask about it. Nothing again.

Now it's early April and I've wasted time and money on this piece of junk. I don't want a replacement, I want my money back and I want it now.

I suspect the company lost a lot of money on this venture, and I'm sure their customer support manager is running his tail off to answer all the angry cranks like me.

"As typical of modern video games, this games had great graphics. It has a story mode, which is lame, however you cannot play the story with the character of your choice, which is a downside.

I also noticed that for every fight you win the 1st round the AI beats you for the second. You cannot block any move and it blocks virtually everything you throw at it. LAME!!! I did not like that it forced me to choose a faction prior to even starting the story mode. I do not want to join a faction. And it did not let me undo it either. Half the moves on the move list you can't even perform and the fighting goes so quickly that you can't even finish the moves before having to try another one.

"I had to replace my Xbox One headset in just barley over a month of my purchase of the Xbox One:

"We love Sudoku. We play it online quite a lot, and use the Brain Age version of Sudoku frequently as well. We thought it'd be great to have a PSP game solely dedicated to Sudoku. Unfortunately, the Go! Sudoku implementation was poor.

First off, about the gameplay in general. You get a Sudoku board, can choose from puzzles of various difficulties, and can choose a background theme. Once you play a game on a given profile, that's it. You can't play it again. Since you rarely ""memorize"" a board, it seems a shame not to let you replay it without resetting everything.

Next, part of how you play Sudoku is by marking the ""possibles"" in a given square until you figure out what it really should be. In the Brain Age version, you can do that. Here, you can't. Your only choice is to turn on ""help"" which then marks ALL possibles on the entire board, all the time. With help turned on, all you do is look at the board for the square with only 1 possible in it, and put that number there. Then the board updates and you look for the next square with only 1 possible in it. It's not a game at all. They should have let you put in possibles yourself, instead of making you try to juggle that all in your head.

The game has a really annoying redraw problem. Every 10 minutes or so, the game freezes with a ""please wait"" message that sits there for perhaps 30 seconds. Then it lets you play some more. So you might be right in the middle of doing something, and suddenly you have to twiddle your thumbs until it unfreezes. Apparently this has to do with battery charge - and the lower your battery gets, the more frequently the pop-up comes up. It counts the 'freeze time' against your total time to solve, too. Bad, bad, bad.

If you type in a wrong number, it IMMEDIATELY tells you that number is wrong. This makes no sense in Sudoku. Part of the challenge is to follow a road until you get stuck, then to backtrack and figure out what you did wrong. It's like a crossword puzzle or a maze. To just flag you immediately loses that aspect of the solving.

This is one of the only games that I've played that I completely DO NOT recommend at all. If you want to play Sudoku, buy another game. Don't buy this one.",1.0

The characters you play as are simply scum bags with nothing better to do then rob steal and kill. Remind you of anyone else you've heard who's purpose is to kill steal and destroy? And even though the game is rated mature there are children who will get their hands on this awful mess. Video games are different then movies or other entertainment, they are more desirable and appealing  to children then any other form of entertainment out there and its a shame this type of crap is even made into entertainment. Another shame is that how successful this game has been which unfortunately tells the game makers that this is the kind of crap that people want. I did actually play this game but not for long.

"As a fan of both Diablo1 and Diablo2, I was extremely excited about Diablo 3. The game we are presented with, after almost 5 years since announcement, is entirely too short and the different difficulties/characters add minimal replayability to the game.

I completed normal and nightmare difficulties and was just too bored to continue playing into hell difficulty. The core of the game is the item drops which are dumbed down from what we had to choose between in Diablo 2. You're going to only be looking for your primary attribute, vitality (health), and attack speed. Gone are the neat effect granting items from Diablo 2 (on being hit cast such-and-such spell, and too many others to list). The item drops are also painfully rare, with emphasis on visiting the community trash bin (auction hall) for decent items.

The real killer of the title for me was the uninspired story. The whole plot reeked of being made up as they were going along. I will say that act 1 was pretty interesting until the butterfly gal started destroying aspects of the lore. The other acts felt rushed with the random events disappearing almost entirely for Acts 3 and 4. There is no strong villain here, I never felt like my actions were urgent.

One of the biggest questions I had going into this title is what would happen to the heroes from Diablo 2? After Diablo 1 we learned the fate of all 3 of the heroes (rogue became Blood raven, Warrior was Diablo, ect). All we get in Diablo 3 is a very brief mention of the necromancer in one of the all too rare events. The awesome idea of making the playable barbarian the same character from Diablo 2 was completely scrapped, which would have provided an interesting spin on his perspective of the story.

If you're looking for a fun title to play for one week, pick up Diablo 3. Don't expect the epic story and replayability of the predecessors. I sure miss Blizzard North..",1.0

"When I saw the commercial for FF XII the first thing I did was go to the store and paid 50 BUCKS for the game. I pop it in and began to watch the beginig movie...it was beautiful great graphics and what not. Then i had control of Vaan I played about 20 hours of the game befor i ran to the store for a refund.

The story is so boring and so long I mean I hear that the storyline is over 90 HOURS LONG!!!!!!!!!!!! normaly I would not have a promblem with that except not only is the story long and boring but every thing you do in this game is something like this town,dugueon,town,dugueon,dugueon,dugueon,town and no story in between.

I mean what is happening to Final Fantasy what is happening to the RPG series I grew up with... and i think i know whats happening to final fantasy. When Square Soft made the movie -FF the spirits with in- the movie flopped so bad that Square Soft had no choice but to join with Enix or Square Soft would have died. now Square Soft (now Known as Square Enix)
kicked out all of the orginal workers of Square Soft such as (nobuo uematsu the music producer of ff 1-10) and (hirnobu sakaguichi the producer of FF ). now Square Enix is milking the FF name and  been destroying the FF name ever since they took over.

Is Final Fantasy coming to a end????? to tell you the truth i think so... my only hope now is if Mist Walkers (a new company formed by the people who were kicked out by Square Enix) can demonate Square Enix befor Square enix can slander the FF name anymore.

"Some people seem to think that Suikoden 4 is the best game ever, yet can't even write a decent review concerning it. Most people here seem to be too loyal to the original Suikodens to admit that this game is terrible. Suikoden 1 is my favorite game of all time so I actually know what im talking about.

The graphics are horrid. The towns don't get better. There are literally 2 dungeons in the whole game that are absolutely terrible. The character models are bland and disproportional. The main character has eyes the size of grapefruits while other have regular eyes. What's worst, the enemy badguys are so incredibly unoriginal and boring to look at. There's some grass with mist floating over it. Grass is one of your monsters... These monsters aren't interesting like those leaves seen in previous Suikodens. All the monsters look stupid.

The story has been done before. It deals with the Runes a little more, but doesn't really have much else to do with the previous Suikodens. Considering it takes place 300 years before the first, they can't put many original characters in(clive, flik, viktor). One of your first missions is to go to Middleport. When you arrive there, a man asks you to kill a monster in the sea. Apparently, it was just a black pot with the ability to call upon the water god. That was stupid and pointless.

The battles quickly become repetitive, as they are constant. Random battles occur way too often. Breath of Fire for the GBA had this problem, but those battles you could deal with. This game has way too many easy battles. Upgrade at a blacksmith and buy some armor and you'll be unstoppable. The water battles would be fun if they weren't so strategically easy. If your enemies have lightning boats, get an earth rune cannon and he's dead. It's as simple as that. The duels don't occur enough. When they do, they are so easy as you just listen to what the opponents say and you win.

The worst thing about this game are the little technical issues that Konami decided not to fix. For example, autopilot doesn't work ever. What they did for the islands was make large invisible barriers around them. When you first have to go to Middleport, cruise around the island it's on. You will realize that the collision size of the land is too big, and when you hit it, it will cause you to spin off into some weird direction. Another stupid thing is the way your character walks. He looks like he's sprinting but he doesn't move fast at all. Even worse, Konami made the characters swing their swords like idiots. When you hit an enemy, your character will walk up and lightly swing their sword. The sound of the sword hitting and the impact point are different. That sounds weird, but play it and you'll see what I mean.

So how are the characters exactly? They must be good, considering there are 108. Well, some of them are. However, you quickly learn that Konami didn't know what to do with most characters. Snowe is constantly changing personalities. At first he's a brave fighter, than he falls on his arm and breaks it apparently. He then complains about it and runs away. 5 minutes later you see him rowing a boat. He then gets out and complains about how he cant move his arm. The commander believes him. How was he rowing that boat just now if he couldn't move is arm? Why is Snowe all of a sudden scared of battle. About 20 minutes earlier you got attacked and he was fine. And why did those guards let that one dude raise his hand up and summon his rune? Why didn't they just kill him? Things like this make the characters seem stupid and uneven.

I would love to give this game a good review. I truly would. I loved the original Suikodens and Konami is better than this. One person said that the graphics were the best they have ever been in the series. No they aren't. They aren't the best in the series, and anyone can clearly tell you that. GMR reviewed the game and only gave it a 5 out of 10. This is a horrible score to recieve from them. The graphics are so bad to support the higher poly character models. Everything runs smooth, but it looks like crap. That leaves only one real question.

Why do you think Konami is only selling this game for 40 bucks. Why won't they just sell it for 50? Maybe they know that it isn't that great, considering the screenshots released a year ago look exactly like the game now.",1.0

This device plugs into your super nintendo for power and a controller, but that's it. It doesn't feed video back into the SNES to come out the SNES's connection to your TV, and it doesn't allow you to play ROMs, or use any mutli cartridges, and it doesn't even cover all games well because it doesn't have what it takes to cover different hardware aspects of the games. To top this off, you have to connect a video cord from the device to the tv, taking up another spot, and if your tv only has one set of RF inputs, and you're already using them, then every time you want to play you have to disconnect the other thing to connect this.

This device is a chip with a an emulator built into it. It doesn't have the gameboy hardware in it, which is why it can't play all games and it doesn't work right. It also doesn't put video out through the SNES, which basically means you may as well not use it. I've actually purchased an addon for my GBA that will output to the TV, so this is beyond useless to me.

Here's what it needs to be... It needs to be able to feed video back into the SNES... ""But the SNES doesn't have the same graphics capabilities of the GBA"" you say? Funny, with the right hardware in the cartridge you could make it output so much more considering you have much faster processors nowadays, or at the very least you could build in the same RF adapter that SNES uses in order to just switch it over... And it needs the GBA guts, so it can play ALL games, as well as multi-carts, imports, and ROM carts...

COD2, CODUO, Novalogic Multi-role Fighter F-16, Novalogic Mig29, Novalogic F22 Lightning 3, Postal, Doom3, UT2003 and 2007. AVP Gold.  Black Hawk Down. These are older games and many are not supported anymore exepcially the Novalogic games.  Since many of these games came out I have updated my system from P3's, to P4's
to AMD Athlon, to AMD Athlon Dual core, then Dual core 2, and video cards from Creative Annilator 256 $429. TO Geforce MX200, 400, Geforce 6300, 7800, 8600, 9800GTX+, 260.  Guess what??? If these games had DRM, I would no longer be able to play any of them.  So this goes back, unopened.

When are they going to learn.  The same was true of Crysis Warfare, and so many other awesome games that they lost tens of thousands of sales.
I have two son's. They is 3 legal copies of each of these games I will not buy.  Oh, I want to check the game out, so I will wait until the cracked version comes out tomorrow, check it out, then uninstall it from a test system I can restore the harddisk from image so to not risk
a virus.  Something I would NEVER do if I owned 3 copies purchased from Amazon....

The irony here is that the Pirates are not paying and they are playing.  We want to pay for legit copies, and we are left out.
If they think that the console games are not crackable,  man they really just are losers.  These must be the same guys that
said VCR's would put Movie theaters out of business.  They said the same about CD""s.  Now they say it with online music. Itunes seems
to be making artists a lot of money.  In fact, many artists skip going with a label and produce the album themselves and sell it on Itunes.
(They should have thought of that... Who needs a record label????)  If you have a PC, M-Audio interfaces, or even buy a $400 16 channel mixer, and mic's, either way, you can produce your own albums, sell them, and screw the company.

It was nice seeing some new movies being released to FIOS on-demand before it even came out in the theaters!  Smart!
People who like the theater experience will buy it and see it on PPV, then go see it in the theater.  These are the
guys earning the big bonuses. Losers, with MBA's from Harvard, Princeton.

They make movies about a kid running a toy company R&D department.  Well there is some truth in that
and some reality that needs to go in. But my God, these morons are killing their own game sales!",1.0
"GRAND THEFT AUTO VICE CITY is one of the greatest games of all time! But don't make the mistake I did. I've already owned the game on the PS2, so I made a dumb decision by buying it on the PC, where I thought the game would have better graphics and controls. I WAS DEAD WRONG! Don't buy this game on the PC unless you have a good computer! I have a Windows XP, so I won't recommend you playing games on this computer! The graphics are even worse then in the PS2 version, and the controls are terrible. What a waste of [money]! Don't be a moron like me, and don't buy this game if you have a [bad] computer!",1.0

It's becoming a rip-off my girlfriend and I have purchased all the games for this series just about and between just dance 16 and 17 its become oh just buy a yearly game and lets overcharge for subscription.

The Mic is short and DOESN'T pick up well and I have Bass in my voice like BARRY WHITE!

Been playing since 2003. Love Sims classic. Luckily skipped Sims 2. Yes you can play Sims 3 but I do not spend time gaming just to have my work go POOF. It is a SCAM if you cannot save your game EVERY TIME. I've been battling this save bug and a ton of other BUGS. With all the other games out there, I'm shopping elsewhere.

"I was expecting a Far Cry 2 clone, one of the best games ever made, the last Far Cry worth playing.

Had Wildlands been released a decade ago, it would have still been wasting my time. The graphics are dead. The world is surely a demo model of something better. Play the first mission and you've seen the entire game at 1% completed. The Immersion is non-existent, the vehicles are like fridge magnets stuck on a matte painting. The game simply suffered a 100 million dollar short fall in budget, though you'd not notice that for what they are still charging for this out of date on release dinosaur. They portrayed it as something it was not.

"Great marketing ploy; throw millions of dollars on sticking your game on every billboard, social media and TV ad and you have the makings of a next-gen classic guys! Witcher 3 is Fable made 10 years later with more RPG elements, trying to follow in the footsteps of Skyrim mixing in GTA . Teenage boys everywhere (who are not allowed to buy this game BTW) are screaming ""10/10 THE BEST GAME EVER MAAANNNNNN!!!!!! OMG 200 HOURZ OF FETCH QUESTS 4 LIFE!!!""

This game has so much swearing and profanity it's the new poster game for teens (who aren't allowed to buy the game BTW). It uses the c-word which is used almost as much as the f-bomb in the 90's so is a pathetic attempt at gaining controversy. The combat is a disgrace consisting of attack, dodge, attack, dodge, retreat, level up, return and smash everyone, rinse and repeat. Maybe if they included harder and more complex combat it would be worth more. No battle is ever won through skill, just grind for hours and laugh as enemies are dispatched with ease. Enemies are so stupid that blocking causes the AI to just hit your sword rather than rip your guts out EVERY SINGLE TIME.

No doubt people who have only started playing games five years ago are going to love this and tell everyone who isn't giving this 5/5 rude words they heard for the first time in this VERY GAME. Really sad.

The graphics are just AWFUL. The Fable reboot and it isn't that far off this garbage visually, and it wasn't even that good. Pretty shades of green worked for that game in 2004 too.

I would say please, but I know millions of people will happily dispatch of sixty dollars to play another copy and pasted fantasy RPG. People liked Skyrim so expect all the DLC and Witcher 4 to be exactly the same garbage which morons will happily buy.",1.0
"!!EDIT #3!!
This is now a NEGATIVE 5 star review!
I thought that, ""Hey... It's been over half a year since I last played this game... Maybe, just maybe... Blizzard fixed the stupid Skirmish A.I. and the game might be fun now..."" Boy was I wrong, as I cannot even play the game anymore because of blizzard treating its paying customers as if they were criminals. They might as well ask for a fingerprint and D.N.A. sample before being able to play. Maybe I need to take a test of some sort before they deem me worthy to play a game I PHYSICALLY OWN! Hell the C.I.A. and F.B.I. websites have less log-in requirements than this freaking game.

I have to REMOVE ALL STARS because this game is no longer playable due to the sheer amount of loops needed to jump through just to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!!! There is nothing wrong with my FIOS fiber-optic connection! There is nothing wrong with my firewall! There is no reason to have to activate a game (for the sixth time!!) I LEGALLY OWN AND HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY OF IN THE DRIVE! It tells me I need to link my game to the battle.net account but doesn't give me a link or any decent information as to HOW TO DO THIS! I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AT ALL IN ANY MODE!! I cannot even log onto the game as a GUEST on my own computer! I DON'T EVEN PLAY MULTI-PLAYER!! Why the bleep do I need to log onto 3 different places to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!?!? This is beyond ridiculous!

If this is their idea to try and stop piracy, then they failed, because this kind of treatment of PAYING CUSTOMERS just drives PC piracy through the roof.

If there is any class action lawsuit against blizzard, or way to return the game, please let me know because I want my $60+ dollars back!!!
!!EDIT #3!!

I just got the retail release... Been waiting 10 years for this... I have to say it is more hype than it delivers on. Yes the controls are still nice and simple, I enjoy that a lot... But it just seems to be Starcraft 1 minus the brood war expansion, with a bit better graphics thrown in. Forgive me for being blunt and critical with this but THEY HAVE HAD OVER 10 YEARS TO MAKE THIS GAME!!!

First off the price was outrageous, but like an idiot fanboy I shelled out $60 bucks for 1/3rd of a game... Considering that this is only the Terran campaign and that the Protoss and Zerg campaigns will not come out for over a year from now, and they will cost an additional $60 each, as far as I know at the moment! Though there are rumors they may be expansion priced at $20 a pop (in all honesty they should be FREE Down-Loadable-Content since it should have been in the game from the beginning!). So Blizzard is becoming even more greedy than EA. Sure when EA releases a game it's too soon, half-a$$ and buggy as all hell, but at least it is mostly there. Blizzard, on the other hand releases a game, a million years after the first game, fully polished and de-bugged, but missing 2/3rds of the gameplay and no big improvements over the original!

The game runs fine on ultra settings for me with vista ultimate x64, 8gigs of ram, and an Nvidia 9800gtx+ card, but I am a bit disappointed considering there has been over 10 YEARS of 3D RTS advancement from the original Starcraft... What I mean is: You CANNOT rotate the camera, only zoom in and out a little bit so sometimes trying to click on one unit in a group of many is a nightmare. You CANNOT rotate the placement of buildings so everything is always facing only one direction, not that bad but units still come out of the sides or backs of buildings through walls instead of the front door... The is NO anti-aliasing support, not that bad, but my computer is a gaming rig. So compared to the older Command & Conquer Generals, or the newer Command and Conquer 3, or Supreme Commander and many other RTS games out there already; this game is actually BEHIND the times in graphics and 3D battlefield control.

One of the worst things is the online requirement... But fortunately it is only checked occasionally so this can still be played offline with a laptop, but in that case you have to log on as a ""GUEST"" for a game YOU OWN on a computer YOU OWN! But BEWARE, when you register the game they ask you VERY PERSONAL THINGS, like: name, age, sex, location, telephone number, and even your street address! And you HAVE to fill it out or else you cannot play the game!

Now for the gameplay... It is just as awesome as the first Starcraft! I am having a blast with it... But that is because this is JUST LIKE the first Starcraft, some of the levels feel like they just took them from the first game and threw in more eye-candy. If you LOVED BASE BUILDING then keep playing the original Starcraft, because this game seems to have been made for the A.D.H.D. And A.D.D. generation, too many levels are small and set with a TIME LIMIT... Come-on Blizzard! You can do better than tiny little 10 minute levels... Though there are still some large maps and unlimited time levels for us base builders. But I miss the huge levels from Broodwar and the original Starcraft where you would have to send out search patrols all over the map to find that last enemy building or objective. I think they spent more time on the cut scenes and in-between game down time than the level design and map sizes, some of the levels feel downright cramped claustrophobic. There are some new, and quite AWESOME units in this game, but there are also lots of missing favorites from the Broodwar expansion. Though one of the new elements I find interesting is the downtime between missions where you can purchase unit upgrades, talk with crew members ""Point and click"" style, and choose the next missions a bit less linear than the first Starcraft, so it has a bit of RPG elements thrown in. They have also jumped onto the whole ""Achievements"" bandwagon so you get these annoying popups now and then that apparently give you bragging rights online or something like that. When you get these achievements, they don't actually do anything that I am aware of in the game other than unlocking portrait pictures for the forums online community.

This game gets 5 STARS for fun because it is just as fun as the first Starcraft, but... It only gets 2 STARS overall for the fact that in over 10 years they could only give us 26 missions in ONE PLAYABLE CAMPAIGN, and slightly updated game-play graphics (one of my friends couldn't tell the difference between the original Starcraft and this one), while taking away LAN play, taking away some favorite units, and jumping on the ""ALWAYS ONLINE"" and pointless achievements intrusive bandwagon.

I loved the original Starcraft to death, so I honestly thought this one would be a bit more updated compared to the original. It is still a very fun game, but I would say... Wait a few more years for a game of the year edition, or a reduced price box-set with everything included, unless Blizzard nickel and dimes its fans to death first.

*edit #2*
Player vs. A.I. is completely messed up, the A.I. does not even make base defenses until 30 minutes into a match and even then it makes only 3 and in a weird place. A.I. also attacks the entry to your base that is nearest to the A.I. base and completely ignores undefended points of your base if they are farther than your main entry point. A.I. also just creates a large mass of units and sends them all at once making the A.I. very easy to defeat with even bad units. Multi-player and VS. A.I. has a lack of unit types, basically half of what you got in the campaign. Every day I play this, it feels more like a still in development beta release.

I will continue to update this review as things get worse or better over time.

---BOTTOM LINE---
Just play the original Starcraft and Broodwar expansion because this is 1/3rd of a game with a slight 3D graphical update, sparkly cut-scenes, and the most draconian and annoying start-up and log-in procedure of any game I have ever played.",1.0
"Well I am seemingly always going through the wired controllers pretty quickly but three days?!! I usually buy the wired over the wireless due to less replacement of batteries/chargers etc. Also, cost is a huge factor with the wireless running on average around double the price. However the major flaw within all the wired controllers is a fairly quick burnout of the wires and thus making the controllers lack connective capabilities. This controller though originally caught my eye due to its more unique appearance & light up abilities unfortunately was made very cheap. The controller wires started to die out by the third day of use, only every now and again finding itself able to keep connection if you wiggle the wires just right. Think I will have to suck it up and start purchasing wireless controllers since they last much much longer.",1.0

"I loved the original Sim City and I thought Sim City 2000 was probably one of the best games for the PC ever... I also had Sim City 3000 which is where the buggy interface started detracting from the gameplay and I had Sim City 4 back when it originally came out and the game was basically unplayable. I had hoped after many years without thinking about it that they'd have 'fixed' the game but they haven't...

Sim City 4 Deluxe is too buggy to play... I had it on for just an hour or so and the game just closed, no warning, no opportunity to save... even during play setting up roads and water pipes aren't fun because things just don't work like they should- To get roads and highways to connect like you want is a real pain- this is a GAME it's supposed to be FUN- don't tell me these roads don't fit together- just MAKE THEM FIT... the same with rewards and special items like the Marina- it takes forever to find a suitable spot to place these things- once again- let me place them and let the game deal with whatever is has to to make them fit.

Worse then the play options was the setting up of the game... It takes 2 discs to install - the second disc however was bad/blank... my computers couldn't see ANY data on the disc and the install wouldn't complete- I had to borrow the 2nd disc from someone else to complete the install- if I didn't know someone with it I'd be out of luck.

Everything about this box is annoying like this... avoid it- this isn't the Sim City you remember. :(

Also laptop users- FYI- the outside of the box says that laptop video cards (even if they meet the 128 MB memory requirement) are NOT SUPPORTED- they may work, they may not and if they don't the publisher doesn't want to hear about it- so don't waste your money or time if you planned to use this on a laptop.",1.0
"To see what they have done to my favorite franchise makes my wanna cry. THIS IS NOT NINJA GAIDEN!!! This is the worst game I have played in a very long time. I've played every Ninja Gaiden game going way back and this is by far the worst game they have ever done, Even the pointless remakes that were the exact same game just harder and a few different bad guys but at least that was still the same game. This is something totally different. It doesn't have the same speed and flow of the any of the other games or the freedom to completely control your guy. And the cut scenes.. My God, the stupid stupid cut scenes that kill the game and make it that much more unbearable. Its so sad to see the coolest most responsive games of all time get treated like this. They tried so hard to make this a game for everyone by taking away everything that made this game so much fun and rewarding. It was known for being ungodly hard and super fast and brutal and now its just some bloated slow boring piece of filth that tries to play its self off as something new. The only people that will tolerate this game are the people that have never played any of the next gen titles before it. If it sounds like I'm yelling and a little teary eyed thats because I truly am. This is my favorite series of all time and to see it turn into this pile of garbage is just depressing. First Madden turns into a child's arcade game and now Ninja Gaiden has turned into a soulless neutered waist of time and money. I will be writing, emailing, calling or whatever I have to do to get in contact with Team not so Ninja and tell them exactly what I think of this awful awful game. .

"Starting off with, I'm a gamer who frequently plays games in windowed mode, as I like to have easy access to my desktop and messenger and e-mail while gaming, and my monitor is big enough to accommodate.  There is absolutely no excuse for a modern game like this one to not have a Windowed mode of any sort.  Even Grand Theft Auto 4 had windowed mode.  At the very least, Dead Rising 2 can be forced into windowed mode via a third party program, but it makes the mouse cursor disappear, forcing you to navigate by keys alone, or blindly.

But that's the least of the frustrations inherent in this game.  It's also the first game that's caused me to angrily smash my keyboard and scream in frustration since I stopped being a child and mostly grew up.  For reasons I cannot begin to comprehend, the game has no autosave feature, and you can only save at bathrooms, which are shockingly not nearly as common as they are in real life, so any time I get trapped in a big dumb horde of zombies and killed, or the game decides to crash, or I fail a mission by running out of time, I have to re-start from my last manual save.  On four straight occasions, I had to redo the same set of missions due to exactly this.

Getting it out of the way early, the story.  I'm only about two hours in, and I already could not conceivably care less about anyone here except for two survivors I picked up, LaShawndra and her pusillanimous husband Gordon, and I interacted with them for all of a 4 minute miussion.

I have no idea what they were intending with the characters, but they come across as stereotypes at best, and grating irritants at worst.  In particular, the women.  Video games and misogyny have a fun and delicate relationship, but I must have been lucky to go so many years without such a startlingly blatant, on-the-nose, completely un-self-aware example in a game (Duke Nukem and the like are obviously comic over-the-top nuttery) such as I've found in this one.

There are two main female characters I've encountered thus far:  Stacey, the activist leader of C.U.R.E. who are against abuse of zombies for some odd reason, and portrayed without a hint of irony as a strong-willed, spirited dame just looking for a big strong man to tame her.

The other is Rebecca Chang, whom they've gone so over the top with making her a Femme Fatale that she comes across as a complete and utter raging bitch.  It gave me no amusement at all when a cutscene had her blatantly bending over and a subtle zoom in on her butt, and she spends the rest of her time constantly berating you and acting 'sassy' and blas when a huge horde of zombies swarm in on us.

The only other female characters worth mentioning are the twins from the prologue, reinforcing the misogyny by being intentionally designed to be complete and utter raging bitches, with nothing but insults to the main character, regardless of whether he wins the opening Terror In Reality game or not.

Then there's the cutscenes.  For the prologue and first mission I literally sat through more cutscene time than game time.  There's way too many cutscenes, which flow poorly, drone on with background mess and clutter, sometimes interrupting gameplay sequences, and overall could easily be replaced with a quick text notification.  In particular, the cutscenes advertising the first maintenance room where you can combine weapons actually took longer than it did to actually combine two things into a new weapon.

At the very least, these cutscenes are all skippable, but when they hit right in the middle of action, they can be distracting.

Now, to the gameplay.

The concept is good, and most of the time, picking up random garbage (sometimes literal garbage) and hitting zombies with it (or throwing it) is fun, and there's a real incentive to actually ""upgrade"" weapons, such as combining nails with a bat or tying a machete to a broomstick, but the fun only lasts as long as the weapon does.  And the weapons always break.  And there's absolutely nothing you can do to repair them or make them last longer.

In fact, given the sometimes arbitrary nature of some of the combinations (as in, you can attach a machete to a stick, but not any other blade), and other combinations that are little more than funny gimmicks, like combining fireworks with a lizard mask, and putting it on a zombie so the mask shoots fireworks.  The amusement lasts only as long as you realize it does no damage and actually draws more zombies towards you.

I've literally had instances where I completely gave up and dropped my newly-crafted weapons (like the Snow Cannon, fire extinguisher plus super soaker) for a big wooden stick because it's just not good enough for the situation.  The weapons are frilly and gimmicky, but when the game throws scores and scores of zombies at you all the time, especially this early in the game, it's not worth dicking around with a weapon that is one-time use or only hits one zombie at a time when you need large area-of-attack weapons like sledgehammers or tomahawks just to get across a hallway.

Similarly, a lot of the combat animations seem poorly chosen, made just to look cool at the expense of gameplay or logic.  For one, when a zombie grabs you from behind, your characters makes the highly questionable choice of throwing his own body back to smash its head on the ground.  Most of the time, this means your character is throwing his own body back INTO the large group of zombies he was running away from.

Other animations, particularly certain special attacks, require an extra half-second or so for the character to do his wind-up dance, or the stupid recovery time from certain cool-downs or missed attacks.  And given the annoying nature of zombie grabs, it means that you're practically guaranteed to be grabbed by a zombie if you try to use a frilly special weapon that takes too long to ""deploy"", such as the Power Guitar.  Adding to the frustration is that to escape the zombie grabs, you have to wiggle your mouse side to side, and most of the time, you will lose a health point as soon as you're grabbed, meaning you could end up dying while trying to run through lines of zombies, and end up having to reload back to wherever you last manually saved.

For a big budget game charging full dollar, this is a bit much, though I would deem it all tolerable and yet still fun if not for the TIME LIMIT.

The basis of the story is, the military is coming into town in 3 days, so everyone just has to sit and wait, with Chuck maybe going out to save some survivors left out in the strip mall.  Except that Total Bitch Rebecca Chang airs a news report that implicates Chuck as a C.U.R.E. terrorist who unleashed the zombies on everyone, so Chuck has to go and find evidence that proves his innocence somehow.  As well, his daughter is infected, and needs daily doses of a medicine called Zombrex which bitten people can take and keep living as humans.

This time limit doesn't even run in real time; I went running from one end of the mall to the other, then outside, then to the arena, and rescued a redneck couple.  It took me at most 15-20 minutes total.  In-game, 3 HOURS had passed.  Even spending a few seconds saving to a new save slot had several MINUTES pass in-game.  And unlike games like Grand Theft Auto, the countdown clock doesn't display minutes as passing like seconds, but appears in allegedly real time.

As well, there's a time limit on every mission you're given, from the main quest to secondaries to rescuing survivors.  There's even a time limit on having NO MISSION AT ALL; in between two main mission quests, it said ""Stacey has nothing for you at this time"" and to wait for her to call me.  This tidbit was running down its timer even with no mission at all, and went down into the red before I received a text message from her calling me back to base, with barely enough time to go out anywhere from the starting area.  And the mission wasn't even urgent!

It makes sense to add some layer of realism in terms of survivor missions (as in, time is running out to save group A, while group B is closer, but if you go after group A, you might run out of time to save group B), but it creates for ridiculous issues when you start running out of time for non-emergency missions, or when you fail the entire game if you're 1 second late to your destination, literally at the door.

If it weren't for those damn timers, in a supposed sandbox game, I would've given this mess 3 stars.  Overall, it's a mess, and the graphics on the zombies and gore look rather cheap for a 2010 game.

"Absolutely no save points...and if you don't play this game 100% perfect from start to finish you will NEVER progress. you just play the exact same level over and over and over...never gaining anything. I am in total shock that there are so many 5 star reviews for this piece of crap. This game frustrated me to the point I wanted to toss my PS3 in the trash, lol. If you are a 13 year old kid and all you ever do is play games then maybe you have the time to memorize each and every spawn point of each and every enemy in this game...and maybe you can beat each level without dying one time. maybe. I doubt it. If you are a normal person who wants a good RPG that you can pick up and play and save and start where you left off and have FUN, then this game is NOT the one for you. I would give this game away for free if I knew someone that wanted to waste away there time with this. Seriously...how the heck could the makers of this game not create a save point system...or a way to at least bank some of your souls collected so you don't have to start over a thousand times!?!

They nailed the graphics and sound effects....and EMOTES. I mean who the F cares about EMOTES??? WHERE ARE THE MAPS, VEHICLES, CLONE WARS, SPACE BATTLES, GALACTIC CONQUEST AND CAMPAIGN MODE? AND THE DLCS HAVE MORE CONTENT THAN THE ACTUAL GAME. IT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE.",1.0
"If it's not obvious by the title, i am not at all happy with Societies.  The game flat out doesn't work, it's defective.  It's like buying a broken toaster and trying to toast with it.  As you will  no doubt read in forms and reviews here, if you're one of the probably 2% of gamers that actually are able to get the game to start without a runtime error, the frame rates are aweful, the game lags out and crashes (so i've read.... on five computer's i've tried to run this game on, i can't even get it to start! ).  My gaming rigs aren't slouches either, the computers run other recent games like Team Fortress 2 and Gears of War PC just fine but SimCIty Societies flat out doesn't even start up.

I thought SimCity DS was bad, at least that worked!  It's become clear to me that EA has butchered the game and SimCity is never going to get any better than SC 3000.  It's time to move on I guess and forget what a great game this franchise used to be under Maxis control.

This will be the last EA game i buy as well.  I had boycotted them already for a year on Xbox 360 after the other steaming piles of crap they'd released for that console.  I had hoped their quality had improved over the year but it hasn't.  It's no wonder Activision has taken EA's number one publisher spot.  EA needs to be ripped apart and rebuilt, get some people in there that actually know how to make games that work and oh ya.... an QA lab would be a worthwhile investment as well.

"I am a huge Gothic series fan, and I was waiting for this add-on since JoWood announced it. Gothic 3 was rathe bad, but this add-on not just bad, it is an insult to the gaming community.

Plot: Written by complete idiots. Ridiculously bad.

Gameplay: The same as in G3 - no change in combat system, no nothing.

Bugs: All possible and impossible bugs are present - from difficulty with installation, insyability, and memory problems leading to crashes every 10 minutes or so, to flying trees, absense of water in rivers, birds flying 2x2 formations, cows running like horses and going through walls (I guess they are indian super-cows or something), missing dialogue options, missing NPCs, and so on and on and on...

The only value this game has is a comedy one - you will have hours of fun (interrupted by constant crashes) reading ridiculous dialogues and doing idiotic quests.

"I have been playing this game for a couple of days now, and no matter how hard I try I absolutely hate the game.  I find the game to be boring as all hell, dull, and overly easy.  I bought this game after getting Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 as I loved both games, but unfortunately this game is not as exciting, as fun or as challenging as either of those.

Gameplay (1/5) - The game is so boring that it is not even funny.  From the first section NPCs do all of your fighting for you, then when you finally do get to take control and climb through the sewers your magic can kill anything rat or goblin in 1 hit.  Travelling from area to area is absolutely aweful.  You have to trudge across long stretches of land to get from one location to another, this would not be so bad, if there were tons of enemies to kill in the middle, but finding an enemy is like pulling teeth.  The fighting isn't aweful, it actually works pretty well, if you can stomach sword fighting in the first person perspective.

Leveling System (1/5) - Oh my god, this is an absolute nightmare.  In every other normal RPG you fight enemies, you get exp and you can level up... not in this one.  To level up you chose a set of dominant skills and you have to use them over and over to increase their skill until you level up.  For instance if you chose Destruction all you have to do is spend an hour shooting fireballs into space and you will level up, or if you chose agility, you jump up and down for an hour and you level up, if you chose blade, swing you sword around for a while and you level up... it dosent even have to be at an enemy, it can be at air... get my drift??

Quests (1/5) - Very few of the quests are really fun.  They all entail hiking long distances, to do some repetitive action, fight a few bad guys and call it a day.  Truthfully nothing fun or creative about it.

Plot (3/5)- The plot is pretty good, the emporer is dead and you have to find his illegitimate son to take the throne, the only problem is a portal has been opened and demons are pouring out of it, so of course you have to save the world.  Pretty generic stuff, but could be worse.

Powers/Weapons (5/5) - I really do love the inclusion of powers.  You can use every combination you can dream of and the magic system was done very well.  My character is a mage base so I use the powers more than I do the weapons.  The powers have different classes from healing to killing to everything in between.  I love using the conjuring, destruction and healing powers as I find them the most useful.  The weapons are pretty generic sword, shield, mace, until you get further in the relly start getting cool.  They are useful, they do the job and they are easy to use.

Graphics (3/5) -  The graphics really are nothing to get that excited about.  The scenery and the towns are beautiful, well built and perfect.  But other characters are a disaster, they look aweful.  The targeted landscape or perfection and dropped the ball on character design.

Music (3/5) - What can I say? Generic Lord of the Rings-esq music, not good not bad, just, egh.

In essence the game is a cross between Lord of the Rings and Fallout.  The came is very mediocre, and is boring as all hell.  I expected it to be similar to Fallout in the amount of enemies and difficulty but I was dead wrong at that point.  Either rent it or buy it used, definately not worth the money.",1.0

"I am writting this review because I love to keep great games and play them years later. The DRM on this product prevents me from doing this. What happens when the game is no longer supported but I haven't used up my 3 activations? Since the DRM wouldn't be able to contact the ""Mothership"", again I am out of luck. No more strolling down memory lane. What happens if the game studio goes out of business, again, the game is no longer usable. What happens if EA goes out of business next week, everyone who is currenly playing this game would be out of luck. Isn't that a nice picture! Then what happens to the DRM still running on your computer. If you are lucky, it doesn't do anything. If you are unlucky, you will be reinstalling your OS and your games again. Oh, btw, you just used up another installation credit for any other games using DRM.
You would like to think the gaming industry would have learned something from the music industry fiasco. Treating your paying customers like crooks will only cause your sales to drop. The harder your squeeze, the more customers you will lose.

I have never stolen any games and never will, but this type of treatment won't earn the industy my hard earned money.

To all gamers out there, please take a stand and not purchase games that support this type of treatment. To those people out there who think I am just a whiner, more power to you.

"I deleted my old review and am replacing it with this one star middle finger review.

1.  A internet connection is needed...that fact isn't listed in the manufacture's discription.
2.  Minimal requirements....that fact isn't listed in the manufacture's discription either.

Here are the minimum system requirements;

OS  Windows XP.  (I'm runnin vista 32 bit and it runs fine.)
CPU  Intel Pentium 4 supporting HT technology AMD Athlon 64
Ram  512 MB (Windows XP) 1 GB (Windows Vista
Hard Drive  8.0 BG
Monitor 800x600
DVD-ROM drive  DVD9 compatible
Video Card VRAM 256 MB. DirextX 9.0c/ Shader 3.0 NIVIDIA GeForce 6600 series
Sound DirectSound compatible; DirectX 9.0c (PC audio solution containing Dolby Digital Live required for Dolby Digital audio)
Imput Devices  Mouse. Keyboard
Internet  Broadband connection required for online battle.

Anyway, I don't have broadband but I wasn't gonna battle any of you and you don't need it to get this thing running.  But the internet is needed to get it running.

The game itself runs okay....but it was more movie than game.  I would have given it a solid three stars.

Would really benefit from a ""free motion"" environment, like Oblivion, or just about any other game out there, today.  You feel confined within a very small part of your ""scene"" and checkboxes to confirm you've done all you can do in each area kinda takes away the mystery.

"This game was on my partners Christmas List, she was looking forward to using it like the wii fit and was excited to see another fitness game come out that was compatible with the wii fit board.  When she didn't get it, she treated herself to the game and immediately tried it the next morning for her fitness workout.

Within ten minutes I could hear her complaining so I came downstairs to see what was wrong.  She stated that the controls were not responding to her movement and in between each training excersise you had to jog - FOREVER!

Besides the complaints about the graphics or the workout outfit not looking right, this game has some serious flaws.  That other stuff is minor when it comes to getting a workout.

When I attempted the game to figure out the controls to than teach my partner, I did build up a sweat.  But, it wasn't necessarily a sweat from a GOOD workout, it was a sweat from trying repeatedly to get the controls to respond the way they should or supposedly are suppose to respond.  (I was working with the wii fit board and did not try this without the wii fit board).

These are some of (what I consider) major problems with the game.

1.  Since you shouldn't actually lift your feet and run in place on the wii fit board, the forever jogging in place starts to hurt your calf muscles (or maybe I am just really out of shape).  I am not opposed to jogging, the complaint is the jogging happens after EVERY activity and it feels as if it just goes on and on and on.  Honestly, if I wanted to jog most of the game, I would have just put wii fit in and ran with the dog.

2.  The tire excersise, you really need to put your weight to one side of the board and it still doesn't always respond.

3.  The grenade throw, well it works fine by yourself and only to the one side, but we tried this out playing together and nothing responded.

Honestly, workout games are not my thing, but I actually really like the wii fit and do it regularly and I was also looking forward to this game because I thought maybe I could also get a fun workout. NOT WORTH THE $30!

The outcome - this game sucks.  I wouldn't even give it one star but I had to give it something.  If you want a good workout game, other than the wii fit game, my partner very highly recommends My Fitness Coach.  It doesn't use the wii fit board, but gives you a good consistant workout.",1.0
"Save your money. I have tried to find something positive to say about this game but I can't. This has to be one of the worst games I have played in years (and I play them all).

"The previews looked so cool. Get this, you need a TUTORIAL TO WALK. Yes, walking is a pain. WHenever you go sideways you actually strafe sideways, it is really inconvienient. The controls are terrible. You will see what I mean when you get to the first part of the training. You have to run around a room in an extremely short time. I had to do it like 8 times. Basically to beat it I walked straight, strafed left, then went backwards, and narrowly got it. Then the combos, they are so difficult to pull off. I honestly feel that the creators were trying to make it as hard as possible to lash out against the society or something.
The backgrounds are terrible. I rented this game for one day and was fed up with it after 5 minutes of the first level. You honestly are going to see alot of boxes, in some of the most uninspired and retarted rooms ever. One room was a square. O thats right, they are all squares, with 2 or 3 boxes of course. Can't forget those boxes.
The guns are the worst actually. When you shoot 6 bullets with a gun, mabye 5, your girl looks at the roof. She cannot hold a gun straight. The target practice is basically 3 targets going directly upward. I mean seriously, this chick is an operative, and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in 6 shots or less. O but wait, lets say she walks while she shoots, now magically her gun has no recoil and she is fine. So whenever you want to shoot anything and actually hit it with 2 shots or more, you have to move around. Want to know something else? The guns are stupid.
The combos are hard to pull off, and worthless. I could care less about snapping that guy, I only have 2 arms. Jeez, it's like memorizing the dictionary, then repeating it word for word with the same exact tone and depth that you memorized it with.
The game is terrible. Spend no money on it. Rockstar must of been payed to stop making this game, because I never see it anywhere, and that is a GOOD thing.",1.0

"Okay there is a lot of positives about this product that's for sure which I will not touch base on. I will only talk about the one major problem... What was the point in buying this controller? To be ""fraggin' like a pro"" with a cool MLG logo? No, the point in buying this controller was to have 'no slow turn' thumbsticks with an all around better controller. Now this was true at first. But, like all other controllers the thumbsticks will wear out and will stop snapping to the center. And guess what? Mad Catz does not sell replacement thumbsticks, at least I couldn't find any, and these do in fact unscrew and detach. Perfect. So I have this awesome controller ($99.99) which was double-triple the price of a wired ($33) or wireless ($40) microsoft controller and it wears out just like they do AND doesnt have replacement thumbsticks.

Also another note about the thumbsticks, I can't be the only one experiencing this problem, sometimes while pressing a direction the controller will make me move the complete opposite direction. This only happened with the left stick. This is annoying in single player games.. even more annoying in first person online shooters which this controller was designed for. Also the B button didn't work on occasion but my rant is with the thumbsticks not the buttons.

I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone and I will not buy another Mad Catz product again.",1.0

Basically, all you have to do is run around a generic level collecting things and occasionally discovering a secret room. Even something as novice as this could have been fun if the controls were not totally useless. It's a very difficult game to navigate through especially since the physics of touching baddies and dangerous objects just doesn't seem right.

I've heard people say they beat the first boss on their 2nd try bul*******! That's NOT possible unless you use Co op.

Please creators of this game, it looks so damn good and is dark but it is impossible to play. Please make a game that average players can enjoy.

"-----My opinions----

I started playing the 2k series at 2011 but its was 2k12 that got me hook to this game. I just bought the game 2k13 at gamestop for $65 including tax( what a rip off, $60 for a game is overpriced and the tax literally heighten my anger) and I just want to return it asap. I feel my money is getting wasted. In nba 2k12 I reached all star lvl not to say im a pro but i play this game often. Im just expressing my views of the game no offense to anyone, Im a casual gamer and I hope this will help those who are debating about the game make a decision.

My list of pros and cons for 2k13:

Pros:
1) somewhat better graphic,thru i really didn't notice any major improvement or difference
2)Update roster (kind of the only reason I buy)
3)online play is more stable now

cons:

1)Minor control changes here and there (the ally hoop button change to a bad spot,sub,view,etc)
2)Notice the gameplay is not as fluid or rapid as 2k12 (idk if its just me or what i notice the players run really slow compare to 2k12?)
3)Too many Jayz ( don't get me wrong I love his songs but I don't want to only listen to one artist for the whole time I will be playing this game)
4)Last years covers is way better than this years (Im cool with d rose and durant, but BLAKE GRIFFEN? He is the most overratted dunk champion of all time and literally have no skills besides dunking) (FYI: LAST YEAR IS WAS JORDAN MAGIC AND BIRD....3 )
5)Too many decorations, not as real as the last one.
6)Shots selections are weird, felt like 2k make this game very complicated now (certain buttons activates certain more,etc)
7)SINCE I DIDN'T ""PREORDER"" THIS GAME IM NOT ENTITLE TO ALL STAR BONUS ETC,WHICH IS COMPLETELY BULLS BECAUSE I PAY FULL RETAIL FOR A BRAND NEW GAME AND IM STILL NOT ENJOYING THE WHOLE GAME.

CONCLUSION: If you want to buy this game I strongly suggest you go try this game at your local game store first before buying it. Be prepare to not have the all star bonus stuffs even thru you pay good money. Your best bet will be to wait till this game's price drop, its almost holiday season. This game will go on sale.",1.0

"Now take into consideration that this follows the same trend as all COD games: just a remake of a past game, does not use servers (uses 1990s host connection/matching), laggy, buggy, rushed.

That being said, this game has really taken the cake on failure. I've wrote a lot of reviews on Amazon with only this one being the negative review, I usually write reviews on all my products, so I am not merely a negative nancy over here. Anyways, this game has a roughly 3 hour campaign, which is pitiful by today's standards. There are roughly 3 guns to use in multiplayer and the snipers, any other guns make no sense and show the pitiful excuse for programming that has become Infinity Ward. With as much money as Activision makes for these games and the DLC's, you would think they could pay for dedicated servers and fix the lag issues. And of course this being a rushed COD game, TONS! of lag. People glitch and hack their way past so many things in the game, it shows that Activision has without a doubt began to ignore the older consoles.

Anyways past the short campaign, past the lack of servers, past the lack of usable weapons, past the lag, past the hackers, past activision ignoring their customers, past the poor programming, it is still a horrible game",1.0

"Are you looking forward to spending time with all your favorite characters from Tales of Xillia? Too bad, they all take a backseat to new silent protagonist Ludger.  While having a silent protagonist that makes dialogue choices works in RPGs with custom characters, it doesn't fit here and it gets old incredibly fast.  The skits are the most noticeable part where it's lacking as everyone talks at him or to him and his response is just ""...."" or *gasp.*

Did you like playing as your favorite character as well and look forward to seeing how they changed? Too bad, Ludger is ridiculously OP and has a ""God Mode"" transformation that you turn into during the fights after filling a meter.  He's the only one with this mode so the game practically requires you to play as him exclusively.  Luckily, since you have to play as him all the time they gave him three weapon sets so he can be agile fighter, heavy hitter, ranged and basically do everyone's jobs for them as well.

Were you looking forward to a new story? Well it's hidden behind an in-game paywall.  Not with real currency mind you, but a fake in-game debt system that you are literally reminded about every few minutes to make a payment on.  To earn money for this you have to do side quests/jobs constantly and throughout the game like ""go kill this many monsters"", ""go collect items from these enemies.""  You're basically being forced to play an MMO just to be rewarded with more of Ludger's story only, because all the other characters' stories are optional side quests you have to be on the lookout for or you'll miss them.

"I'm sorry to say this, but this game is pathetic, and the level of fame that developer BioWare has gained over it really saddens me. Now, I'll admit that I'm not the biggest Star Wars fan (read: I saw one movie when I was eight), but I am a huge RPG fan, and this game plummets far below my expectations. I will describe my experience with the game, and hopefully you will choose to pass it by and skip the agony I went through.

At the start of the game, I was asked to choose my character's appearance, skill point allocation, and basic moveset. Sounds fun and cool, right? That's what I thought, too. Until I realized that every character model was blocky and pseudo-realistic (you know, that weird, pale, supposed-to-look-human-but-really-doesn't look), the skill-point system was convoluted and confusing to anyone who isn't a hardcore Dungeons and Dragons player, and choosing my moves was so difficult and frustrating that in the end, I didn't even know which ones I had. Creating the character took an hour, and I didn't feel at all satisfied after I finished.

Once I started the actual game, things only got worse. I headed to my first battle, expecting a standard turn-based system at the least, and an innovative action/RPG blend at the most. I got neither. Instead, I was greeted a bizarre mess. In fact, this combat system was so strange and awkward that I don't think I could even describe it. All I know is that, first off, my character was somehow moving on its own, and second, the commands I entered didn't seem to effect what happened onscreen at all.

After making my way through several battles, by way of random button mashing and liberal use of medpacks (that was the easiest way to do it, and seemed to have the same result as trying to concentrate and strategize), I met my first party member. What happened after that just plain scared me. First, the voiceovers made me want to both laugh and scream. Secondly, while the horrendous voice is grating your ears, you have to look at a disturbing close-up of the character's face as he's talking. And finally, THE FACE DOESN'T CHANGE. His expression stayed exactly the same throughout the entire conversation, and this happened with every single other character I talked to. Freaky.

The final part of the game that I played through was the first city. It was big, with lots of people walking around, going about their lives. This would be cool, if I had known where to go in this massive maze. But did I? Nope. Although my horribly-voiced partner apparently knew the city well, I recieved no guidance from him. Instead, he followed me around, giving me no hints but the instruction to ""find Bastilla"". By the way, I knew nothing about what Bastilla looked like or where she might be.

After twenty minutes of running around in the maze, talking to random, badly-voiced people, most of whom had mean things to say, I gave up. Maybe people who like Star Wars and D&D will appreciate this, but I just can't.

To start, for a flying game to be any good you must first get some sense that you are flying.  Aero elite seemed to go out of its way to take that sense from you.  For perspective, I would say that Ace Combat 4 gives you a far better sense of flying.  While that game was not terribly realistic in that your plane could hold 50-70 missles, it is in every other way a far superior game and would give it 3.5 to 4.0 stars.
Aero elite's graphics are Ok nothing great and certainly no better that Ace Combat 4's.  The controls are horrendous, from accelerating to decelerating, to the firing of missles, to just flying the plane around the screen.
There is a great selection of planes, however, It's no fun to fly any of them because it doesn't feel like your flying any of them.

"I purchased this directly from Astro 4 years ago.  A few of my friends had the A40's and raved about them, so I decided to give them a try.  I've spent close to $400 for my setup.  When it worked, it was a great system, by far one of the best.  A little over a year is when the problems began.

My issues is that they are definitely priced above what they are worth, in terms of quality.

The Mixamp jack became loose and broke off internally and was unusable.  Had to send them back for a replacement.  To be honest, I don't recall if it was covered or not.

The other issue we experienced were constant buzzing noises that were being transmitted to other people.  3 out of 5 units we have experienced this.  Contacted Astro several times (well documented by others on the internet) and Astro claims that the units are simply broken, but since they are out of warranty, we all need to buy new ones.  Their customer service reps are nice, but can obviously tell that their hands are tied because they can't do anything about it but want to.

They can't figure out why there is electrical interference in their own products.  At the time, this was clearly the issue as they were posting job listings for an in-house electrical engineer.  That being said, I felt it was a very unprofessional response (""it is working as designed, if not, it's broken and you need to buy a new one"") when clearly the product is faulty.",1.0

"Being a fan of Hellboy, I was kind of looking forward to Hellboy: The Science of Evil.  However, also being a veteran gamer, I wasn't looking all that forward to the game, simply because of the terrible history of licensed video games.  Well, I didn't expect too much out of the game, but what you get here may even be below your lowest expectations.  Hellboy: The Science of Evil puts you in the shoes of the title character as you brawl through numerous hordes of baddies and take on the occasional boss.  That's it. That's all you do from beginning to end in this game, and it gets boring very, very quickly.  Not to mention that the game as a whole is quite short, quite easy, and features some technical issues that all combine to make the game quite bad.  The game features some bland environments and choppy animation, and the clipping issues are more distracting than anything else.  Hellboy film star Ron Perlman, lends his voice to the game, but he sounds so bored that he just adds nothing at all really.  No matter how much of a Hellboy fan you may be, avoid Hellboy: The Science of Evil like the plague.  There's no challenge, innovation, or anything else to even come close to holding your interest.",1.0

"Looking at this game reminds me of another hasbeen that tried to infiltrate the PVP market and failed miserably. Anyone remember SHADOWBANE??? The activities in this game remind me a lot of that one and because this one is also so pvp based it is already doomed to failure. The market out there is PVE based. Most and the majority of people buy and play these mmorpg games for the PVE elements, even Guild Wars massive population is PVE based though some do delve into the PVP aspect, but, and this is a BIG BUT, pvp is by choice and not forced and that must remain with all mmorpg games present and future if they want a massive subscriber base. The developers are in for a rude awakening if they think this game is going to hold a million subscribers with so much pvp the emphasis of the game. The AMerican and European market just aren't into pvp like the koreans and asian markets. Linage I & II really have that pvp market sewed up.
So, in a nutshell I don't recommend buying this game unless you are a PVP fanatic because that is the main element of this one. This isn't a WOW by a long shot since WOW is dedicated to the PVE element. It's better than a Guild Wars in the pvp atmosphere, but, I think Guild Wars 2 is going to solve that issue as it too will have realm vs realm type atmosphere/wars like this, BUT, without destroying the PVE game or forcing people to participate in the PVP element. As you can see the price is already dropping drastically from the initial retail. People are already trying to unload this as a lost cause.",1.0

"Worst game in the Zelda series; even worse than Phantom Hourglass!  The story is just plain dumb, and the game play is ridiculous. Nintendo's attempt to utilize the 3ds' microphone results in a clumsy game features that you really can only use when you're in a quiet room by yourself. Having to use the touchscreen to move your characters as opposed to the analog stick is inefficient at best.

The novelty of bringing Princess Zelda along on your mission quickly wears off when you have to constantly switch back and forth mid-battle to give her new commands since she won't do anything on her own (ironic since she us a monarch). The Lokomos are a ridiculous and improbable race, and result in little more than a visual pun.

The graphics look about as good as graphics did in 1990, and the gameplay consistes of a neverending assault of cookie-cutter clone enemies constantly sapping miniscule amounts of your energy.  This game is the penultimate realization of frustration.  Think cheap shots, uninspired opponents, and a ultra-repetitive gameplay.

"As a sonic fan i expect alot from this blue bur. and buying this game was bad

modern sonic has a side scroll feature (meaning you just move left to right) it was lazy of them to do that. that right there makes the game undesirable. modern sonic (just as in the ps3/360) is suppose to be an all out obstacle course. and the 3ds has a joystick they could of made it happend.

the game lacks challenge it has no motivation. chasing after chaos emeralds and racing your rivals has already been done in countless sonic games. this game has no spunk.

classic sonic has a homing attack....enough said

the challenge mode is not even something to be proud of. playing the same levels with a diffrent twist each time is stupid (complete this course under a min. complete this course with one ring,complete this course without taking damage,complete this course without dieing) its very bland...very very bland

Combat was too easy and then with the werewolves too weird. The wolves ran off and let you shoot at them, then would run at you and then run away as if they were strafing you like a plane.

"I loved gears 1 online although I was not a huge fan of the story, although I doubt anyone was because they purposly made the dialogue like a cheesy scifi.  But the greatest part of it was bring guest online and playing with your friends.  As is such the appeal of halo.  I was really looking forward to going home opening up and playing with my friend who has waited in line with me for 2 hours.  I logged online and spent 10 minutes trying to find how to log a guest in till I realized they had not included that feature in gears 2.  In my opinion the worste mistake they could have possibly made.  Not only that, but they have also made several key tweaks to the weapons that add up to make mediocre online play.  For example the smoke grenade now stuns.  Considering every player in the game starts off with one of these it makes it impossible to hold cover.  It has already become quiet common for a gun battle to just turn into an exchange of smoke grenades.  Also they have make it so you can turn frag grenades into a sort of makeshift mine.  Naturally players are just standing on the frag grenades waiting for them to repop so they can put them in your spawn.  They have also added a pointless ability to crawl while you are down.  This is not only pointless its humiliating.  Dont be mistaken, their is not escaping when you are down.  It just makes it funner to humiliate you for the other team.  Another wonderful addition is the shotgun is now even MORE powerful.  Although they have managed to make it possible to keep them at bay from a range.  Close range the shotgun is now extremely powerful and accurate.  It is not at all uncommon to be eliminated by the first shot, which pairs just wonderfully with the smoke grenade stun.  The game has just turned into a race for who can through a smoke grenade faster.  Another huge dissapointment is the game types promised and maps.  The new game types simply don't offer the excitement that simple execution and warzone provided in gears one, and the maps often foster overuse of smoke grenades and frag mines. I can say though the roadie run and cover system has improved vastly.  The campaigne play is much funner, and the story is much more involving.  But as a person who would only by a game for only play I am extremely dissapointed.  Between no longer playing with guest, a very unbalanced play style, and not delivering on new game types, my worste fears of come true.  After months and months of waiting Gears of war 2......

"I owned an original wired Fender Rock Band Guitar. That one works awesome, and I consider it superior to the Gibson Guitar Hero III guitar.  However, I just got my wireless guitar, and the tilt sensor does not work.  I went to the support website and forums.  Apparently many of the first batch of wireless guitars have this problem.  Although this is covered under warranty, I will be without the guitar for approximately 21 days while they ship me a box, in which I will ship my broken guitar back to EA.  They will then ship a replacement wireless guitar.  I would urge caution when buying because of this.  Hopefully, EA and Harmonix will rectify this problem and future production batches will have better quality.
**Update**
30 days after sending my guitar in for replacement: EA says all replacements are back-ordered and could take an additional 9 days more from their orginal 3 to 4 week replacement estimate.  Buy at your own risk!  Other wireless guitar controller issues have been reported on the Rock Band forums as well.  I would recommend buying this guitar at a brick and mortar store where you can return it immediately if you have problems.  The warranty replacement takes way too long.  Some people on the forums even report that their replacement has issues as well.  It's a shame because Rock Band is an awesome game.
**Update 2**
After 35 days EA sent me a wired guitar controller to tide me over until my wireless guitar controller is repaired or replaced.  The cool thing is I get to keep the wired guitar even after my wireless one is ready.  I didn't call them and complain either.  EA did this without my provoking them.
**Update 3**
After 45 days EA sent me a replacement/refurbished/repaired wireless guitar.  The guitar performs as advertised.  The tilt sensor works great, as well as all the buttons, etc...  I definitely consider it superior to the Red Octane Gibson Les Paul Controller for GHIII, which also works on Rock Band.  Downside for this controller is that it does not work on any of the Guitar Hero series of games.  One minor complaint for EA:  When they shipped my guitar they packed an inordinate amount of silica gel packs with it.  Some of these packs leaked small pieces of silica which fell inside the guitar and now make a rattling noise when I move the guitar controller.  I'm hoping the wireless controllers out now are of the same quality I received in my replacement controller.",1.0
"I knew minutes into the demo for this game that it was bound to be terrible, boring, and watered-down. My wife, however, in desperation to play an RPG (note the lack of RPGs out there right now), bought it and proceeded to play. Eventually, with nothing else to do, I tried playing, with the hope that the demo hadn't properly represented the game. It does. Very well. The move to hack'n'slash is irritating and leaves me more annoyed than entertained. This is especially true since the fights are boring and simply time-consuming. At least in Origins, you could target and sit back, waiting to tactically use your special abilities. The lack of any character choice is ridiculous. Warrior, Rogue, Mage. Male/Female. Combined with the mashing combat, it reminds me of playing Gauntlet Legends years ago (Food is good!). But at least in Gauntlet you got to pick yellow, red, blue, green mage/warrior/rogue. The combat is boring and the game isn't any fun to play. The maps are narrow and simple, practically 2D. Combined with the button-mashing, it reminds me of Street Fighter, except that the special attacks are easier to do than Sonic Boom. And that is just the beginning.

I could never call this an RPG. An action/adventure, but not an RPG. I've played RPGs from Wizardry I to Fallout: New Vegas and this definitely isn't one. The level up is basic and the skill tree is so linear that you never feel like you're actually picking skills, just choosing preselected ones. In Example: skill tree 1 has 6 skills. A, B, C and so forth. A and B are opposites and can't be used together. Possibly both are available to start, but more likely you can pick A at level 2, B at level 3. C requires A, but more importantly it requires you to be level 4. Level 2 A, Level 3 B, Level 4 C. You don't feel any choice in the matter. Sure, you could pick skills from different trees, but why pick several basic skills when you could level your character's specialties. Also, your character's story is even more set in place than Origins. It never feels like your own character, just the character you're playing as.

To the simplification of the game...The trend now is to simplify RPGs to invite other gamers to buy the games. A stupid idea. What FPS gamer is going to suddenly buy an 'RPG' just because it has been dumbed down? The more complex the RPG, the better. That is how RPGs work. Complex story, development, even rules. D&D hasn't survived for so long for nothing. Bioware has gone down the drain faster than Bethesda did. They probably should have just kept paying Wizards of the Coast for rights to Forgotten Realms and kept up with D&D based games. How could you pick Dragon Age over Baldur's Gate? At least Bethesda kept Oblivion playable. It was empty and devoid of anything particularly great, but somewhat fun to play. DA: Origins was a mediocre RPG with boring gameplay and mildly interesting character and plot. DA II isn't even that! It's not even an RPG.

There are other complaints like the extreme buginess and choppy gameplay. But all you really need to know, is that it isn't fun to play. Not even as an action game.",1.0

In my opinion, the only thing that should be updtaed with Jeopardy are the Answers, and categorys. Also, Jeopardy would make a great Nintendo DS game.

"I really wanted to like this game. I wanted to play it ever since I got my Dreamcast. After many delays, it finally came out, so I rented it. Thank God I did. I'm sorry to report, but this is a horrible game. But why? Here's why: 1. The Graphics. While they're certainly not the worst I've ever seen, they really leave too much to be desired, especially for the fact that this is a Dreamcast game. You can see the polygons sticking out of the characters and they don't look real at all. I've seen N64 games that look better than this. Heck, I've seen Playstation games that look better. 2. The Controls. They are the worst part of this game. Using the X, Y, B, and A buttons to move isn't bad, but on default, A moves foward and Y moves back. But that's not all. With almost unuseable menus and 37 commands put into the Dreamcast controller, it makes the game a REAL pain to learn and makes it barely playable. I can assure you, the controls are much worse than they sound. Plus, the loading times are too darn long. But there's a good part to the game. The sounds are very good and draw you into the action. But that's it. I was hoping for a good spy game like Goldeneye, but on Dreamcast, but I just wasn't that lucky. Don't bother wasting your time with this piece of junk.

"Let me start off by saying I love the FF series as a whole. Sure, it's declined over the years, mostly due (IMO) to bad developer decions to focus on being ""cool"" instead of having actual heart and depth of characters - but I still consider this among my top 5 favorite game series.

Now, on to this train wreck of a game. It's bad. Really bad. So bad that it's not even worth considering to purchase. There's absolutely nothing to do in the game except to kill identical looking mobs over and over and over for hours on end. Every couple days you can do 8 miniquests that will help break up the monotony of the grind - but then it's right back to it. Every 10 or so levels you get a few Main Storyline quests which are actually nicely done... but very short lived. Then it's back to the grind.

Add on to that a terrible ui that is purely a console port, servers that aren't language seperated (you think gold spammers are annoying? wait till you see them writing in a language you don't even understand), inconsistant framerate drops even on cutting edge PCs, a lack of communication between devs and the community, the most boring set of classes (and recycled races) I have yet to encounter and a limit on the amount of experience you can gain over time (put into place, according to rumors, to accomodate the Chinese government) - and you have one of the worst mmorpgs ever to be conceived.

DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
"Let me preface this review with the fact that I only play the single player (campaign) part of the game. I have no opinion on how  the multiplayer performed.

This game is way to short, probably less than five hours total if you don't count all the times I was killed. The graphics are so-so and a bit hard for me to see what was going on. The enemies were very difficult to see and sometimes seemed to come out of nowhere, even places I had already cleared. The story is hard follow and really makes little sense. The actions of the AI squad are sporadic and they sometimes get stuck in certain places. There is a large variety of weapons, most of which you have to unlock by scoring points during the level or picking them up from dead enemies. I could not figure out how to use the weapon upgrade system. I played this game on the ""Normal"" level and it was still quite difficult. I did see several bugs throughout the game but I never experienced any lock ups. The first time I played I had to download some upgrades and install a 2 GB portion of the game to the hard drive. Not a big deal, really, but annoying for a high profile game like this. One would think all the bugs would have been worked out before release. I agree with other viewers that this game was released before it was ready. On the plus side the audio was great.

On a personal note I find the trend of these games to emphasize the multiplayer and pretty much provide a token attempt at a single player campaign is very discouraging. If they want to release a multiplayer only game then just say so and we single players will buy something else. No problem.",1.0
This Game starts out pretty good. and really really scary to say the least. But what killed it for me is the Fighting sequences. Also when the Lung Monster came out it just got really really redundant to kill him. and also there is not enough places to save you games. so if your tired or have something to do you either have to lose all your progress or continue to play for who knows how long till you come across one. needless to say i was very disappointed and upset because i was a fan of the prior games and i had big expectations for this game bieng on the ps3 platform.. big disappointment,1.0
"Never have I read so many 5-STAR reviews for a game that was such a disappointment! Perhaps if you play it online you'll get more out of it, but mine's already back in the case and ready to sell after the first day. I honestly don't understand all of the hype and ""this is just the best game"" stuff written about this lame game. If you want a REAL racing/driving game, get Burnout Paradise instead...These two games are so far apart in quality and gameplay, it's not even a contest. What's not to like specifically about Pacific Rift?

1) First, the vehicle controls suck. It's like they respond in slow motion or after a 1-2 second delay. It is a RACE, so you have to go fast. When you do go fast, if your tire simply touches a rock or a tire/obstacle randomly placed around the track, then you either flip over and your vehicle disintegrates or you don't flip over and your vehicle just explodes...Wow...Great fun, huh?

2) Second, since you're going fast over jumps and hills, your vehicle spends most of its time in the air. When you're in the air, you can't steer and you can only watch helplessly as your vehicle lands on a rock and explodes or in a lava field and explodes or sails over a cliff and explodes...Well if you just look at the vehicle the wrong way, it explodes.

3) After your vehicle explodes once or twice in a 2 or 3 lap race, your chances of winning are slim to none. If you don't WIN, as in come in first place out of 16 racers, you don't progress to new race tracks. This was not a fun feedback loop for me.

Now I appreciate some degree of difficulty in a video game...But this ""race"" was incredibly HARD right out of the box in race #1 on EASY level. Why is it necessary to make a game so difficult for a player's introduction to a new game? And as far as ""awesome graphics"", again Burnout Paradise puts this one to shame. This game's graphics are painfully slow and look like the PS3 is doing all it can to just grind them out, like something you'd find on a console 2 generations ago. Burnout's graphics are so smooth even when traveling at incredible speeds...Just as different as day and night.

You'll either love or hate Pacific Rift...So I suggest renting to find out which camp you fall into. If you do buy it, make sure you play it before Burnout Paradise because if you play PR after BP, you'll quickly see and feel how inferior it really is...And that just sucks any potential fun factor right out of it.",1.0
"* Not worth new-release cost!
* Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players.
* Online manual just says ""Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand..."", nothing on how to actually join the game.
* After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in.
* Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. Likely normal. sad. Should be a way to register the game and run the install without the disc.
* Co-op mode is terrible. It should be called something else. It is really just a single player game. If the 2nd player joins and dies. They do not automatically re-spawn, they have to wait for a timer to expire and then press a button to return.
* Camera only follows player 1 and if player 2 goes off the screen, they time out and die. If player 1 dies and player 2 is still alive, it doesn't matter. It acts like both had died and forces you back to a check point.
* For a Sony launch title, the graphics are NOT good. Feels like an older PS3 game.
* Even as a single player game, the actual game play is very boring and the story isn't good so far. Many elements feel like Jax and Daxter from the PS2. And I love that game. But this is a poor imitation.

I wasn't expecting anything amazing. I simply wanted a decent 2 player platformer. As a 2 player game, it's one of the worse I have played. As a single player game, it's just no fun. Even my 7 and 9 year old kids are annoyed by this game. And I thought Disney's Universe for the PS3 was bad. As flaw as that game is, it's better than Knack.

My pain and frustration is made worse by the fact I paid full price for this on release day. Ouch.

IGN gave it a 5.9 out of 10, and I think that is being generous. If you really feel you need this game, at least wait for the cost to drop... a lot!

If you have any questions for me about this game, make a comment. I normally check reviews before I buy a game. But I wanted something to play when I got the PS4 on launch day and coming from Sony and all the hype, I expected this to at least be decent to hold me off until I figured out some other games.

Remember, I bought this game specifically for 2 player mode. And so I am giving it 1 star for that fail alone. For single player action, it's a 2 or 3 star game so far. But certainly still far below my expectations from Sony with all the hype. And even at 3 stars tops from me, that isn't good enough for a $60 new-release cost.

UPDATE: I still can't stand the co-op play on this game. I still feel it's a 1 star if you want this game for 2 players. And it's maybe a 3 out of 5 stars for single player. I finally had a chance to try the Android companion game for Knack and that is awful. Some people are still very polarized on this game. But many reviews agree with me. It's not masterpiece it was hyped to be. Almost a year since it's release and the price is still too high. I would really wait for this to drop below $20 before trying it out. If you are still interested.

Many people have said this review is not helpful. I am curious as to why. The only thing I can think of, is that is their way of disagreeing with my opinion. Comments are a better place for that. As my title says, this review is based heavily on the Co-op aspect of the game.",1.0

"Possibly the worst ps4 game I've ever played. It doesn't start out bad though, it gets progressively worse as you play. The beginnig starts with promise, a cool setting, cool upgraded environments and some interesting new characters.  But after the frst couple missions you realize the ""open world"" is extremely lifeless and linear. There's no identifiable change in scenery, you won't be able to tell one building from another and it all just feels boring and unpolished.

Runners Vision:
They say that there's many paths to get to one place but that's not true. There's only one path with the occasional option to do a wall run or a slide, but overall, free roam or mission, there's always only one path.  This is why you need to use ""runner's vision"" basically a gps system showing you where to go. But this is where I have one of the biggest complaints: the ""runner's vision"" breaks the flow. The way it works is that it will occasionally highlight a bar or pipe that you will need to grab in red and every couple seconds a red ""shade"" with fly in front of you highlighting your path. But they aren't consistent. Those red ledges only show up half the time and the red shade flies ahead of you and disappears.  So, often times you will turn a corner and there's no indication on where to go but you don't want to lose your stamina so you run in a random direction but it turns out to be wrong and you end up wasting time and losing all stamina. I turned off the shade a couple times but then you will become completely lost because remember, there's only one path to the destination! How they botched up one of the essential elements for assisting free running is beyond

""Logic & Physics? Wtv""
Another complaint is the story logic. As many people have complained about, the story here is boring and repetitive. I agree but would like to add that it doesn't even abide by logic. They just don't make any sense!  Why is there a bunch of people just standing on roof tops waiting for a runner to run by so they can ask for a delivery? and why are the receivers just 45 seconds to a minute away chilling on another rood top, and if you don't get there in time even when you're so close that they call out: ""runner, over here!"", the package ""expires""? (which contains things like flowers and letters) Also, the collectibles, why are there just yellow orbs all over the place? What the heck are they? What purpose do they carry? Same goes for the micro chips that I'm stealing from unprotected electrical boxes all over the city, what do they do? Why am I stealing them from even MY OWN HEADQUARTERS? And also, after the cops or ""Krugersec"" raids my headquarters and destroys it, why am I still able to use it as a safehouse? Heck, why won't they just stand on all the roofs and wait for me since they know all the runners just dash around those same buildings? so many questions, so little logic.

Combat
You probably will have to see a video to understand how amazingly stupid combat is in this game. Sense here, again, is abandoned. Like how does a kick to the enemy's face takes a little health, but if he stumbles back a couple steps into a partner he loses half his healthbar? And how can I roundhouse an Elite soldier and after he stumbles back 2 steps throw a kick two meters away but still get me? Combat is forced on you when you play and it definitely big the already wearysome experience.

Vertical Running
Almost all the missions, especially the important ones, take place in some tall building. This means that instead of free running, you will be climbing. Now I don't know about you, but I didn't buy this game for Far Cry style platforming. Jumping from one block to another then rotating around for 3 seconds finding the next pipe or ledge to grab to doesn't really feel like parkour, it feels like labor. But this is exactly what MEC fives you. The last mission in particular does this so much that at one point, you will have a whole 5 minutes of game time just grappling up from grapple point to grapple point like Batman. This to me is just a sign that the team behind the game was tired of their project and wanted to finish up with filler.

Lipsynch and Cutscenes
This is a minor complaint. I didn't mind the cutscenes so much because it was a chance to finally gives the characters more personality, and the graphics were actually pretty good. But lipsynch in most cutscenes are waaaay off, and the final cutscene where Faith showdowns with...., that whole segment started to get choppy and buffer. The game really does get worse and it saved the worst for last.

Conclusion
This game actually reminds me of that cell shaded prince of persia game for the ps3 in the late 2000s. Story was completely pointless as the ending undermines all your achievements, combat was tiring and unsatisfying, landscape was drab and illogical, and parkouring consisted of trial and error due to poor wayfinding.  Boy, I disliked that game.

ps. if you still insist on playing MEC, play with Faith in the elevator, there's usually a reflective black wall that can act as a mirror. you will see how awful she is rendered and for some reason you can see the back of her head when you turn quickly because apparently her eyes can turn around faster than her head.",1.0

"I was really looking forward to this.  I am a moderate Aerosmith fan with at least 12-15 favorite songs that would really rock in this game.  Unfortunately, only 3 made it.  The songs that were chosen would be great if the GH player were as old as Aerosmith (that's right) well over 50-years-old.  And guess what, my Dad doesn't want to play!  So why weren't more songs from the last 15 years chosen? Yikes, I say!

I also started on HARD and got all the way through without any failures.  And I'll be honest, I'm not the greatest player.  GH3 on hard still gives me fits toward the end.

I'll say the replay value on this game is just about nil.  I'll probably return to play a few (5-6) of the songs, but I'm about to give Rock Band for the Wii a try if this is all Activision is going to put out.

"I'm not a hardcore CoD fan, so I'm not giving a low score because it ""feels wrong"" or ""it's not Call of Duty"". This year, this game is objectively inferior to the shooter competition, as if Activision has begun to rest on their laurels and assume top sales are always guarantee. EA has come out swinging this year with some masterful work, filled with innovation and risk taking in an industry where those things rarely happen.

I bought this Deluxe Edition digitally so I could play Modern Warfare Remastered early. Let me tell you, it's not how I remembered it. The game was king by 2007 standards but in 2016 it has not aged gracefully. It has one core gameplay loop - shoot stuff, shoot incoming waves of enemies. The shooting incoming hordes of bad guys was big last generation. It was a staple in Uncharted, Gears of War, where it felt like you killed 100 guys and they just kept coming still. Modern Warfare Remastered is built on this and it's not nearly as fun as it was in 2007, so prepare to have your nostalgia goggles broken a bit.

The Remastered graphics are also decent but not that good.  This game still looks more last gen than current, like they copied and pasted the PS3 version assets, applied bright lighting, less grainy textures and depth of field and called it a day. Some assets, like trees, look to be the same PS3 assets with no change at all. It's clear here that Modern Warfare Remastered was never intended to be the star this holiday season, and it will probably be forgotten about once everyone gets their nostalgia fix.",1.0

In this patch they made it mandatory for your game to have to be connected to the servers to be able to play my player and association.

"Now before i start i want to say i loved Gears of War 1. With that out of the way, Gears of War 2 is a complete disaster. From the moment i popped it into my 360 Elite to when i popped it back out after a couple hours of campaign and a few games of multiplayer. I already sold it back to GameStop. Epic should change their company name to Epic Fail because they sure did drop the ball on this game.

Where do i even start? I guess i'll start with the campaign. It's decent, just a Gears of War 1 rehash, nothing more. Definitely forgettable. The dialogue is completely childish and immature this time around throughout the entire game. Dom does nothing but [...] all game, it gets really old after about the first mission. It just feels so clunky and thrown off.

Now onto my favorite mode and what kills the game for me, Multiplayer. What the heck was Cliffy B smoking when he made this game? The multiplayer is a sheer disaster. Instead of being able to chose what type of game mode you want to play you have to vote now. You can't even choose your team. It's like Halo 3 gone wrong. It's just bad. The shotgun, which was the best weapon and most fun in Gears of War 1 has been completely dumbed down and is now one of the weakest weapons in the game. This game caters to all the Gears of War 1 cry babies that sucked at the game. If you were a lancer noob from Gears of War 1 this game will probably be right down your alley.

1/5 stars, would of gave it zero if i could. Don't buy this game, don't even rent it. Save your money, Gears 2 is just a rehash of the first game that hasn't improved at all. Buy Resistance 2 for the Ps3, it's the best shooter this generation and the best i've ever played. R2 is easily Game of The Year",1.0
"Do not bother with Neverwinter Nights if your only PC is running Windows Vista.  Limited backwards compatibility experienced with other gaming programs does not apply to Neverwinter Nights.  I'll believe other reviews that this was a great game and the Diamond edition is a great bargain - only if you're still running Windows XP.

I noticed all the 1-star reviews for problems with CD keys, but I also found technical help for how to deal with incorrect keys.  I was not anticipating a problem.  I know this is supposed to be the Windows XP version and I'm running Vista, but I've run lots of other older software on Vista.  Neverwinter Nights will not run properly on Vista, and the Atari support site offers no advice whatsoever to deal with it.

I have located alternative sites with advice, but the troubleshooting methods are extensive, highly technical at times, and tedious.

EDIT: I got the software to work after about 3-1/2 hours of trying to find and apply the right patches.  I still have to watch 100% of the intro movie every time, or the game crashes.  Internet help will suggest a line edit to the .ini file that suppresses the intro movie, but when I did this the opening menu became unresponsive.

"Let's be honest - when you stuff so many characters into a game, imbalances are inevitable. Pokemon has become a game about choosing from a select few monsters and metagaming the stuffing out of them. You cannot win with your favorites.

Now I discover that Steam games sabotage my xbox 360 joystick!

My xbox 360 controller, which works fine on other (non Steam) games, fails on Steam games. X axis is 10th speed rendering it unusable. I reset ALL the parameters in game and on my Steam account. Nothing affects it or fixes it.

Since NONE of the setting affect it in any way, where does the problem come from? From underlying programming at Steam. Steam has sabotaged other controllers so they can force you to spend $50 more dollars to buy their controller. I will not be purchasing their controller nor their games nor any other Steam product ever again. Hard to believe they have fallen so far but it is true!

"My son needed a new headset for his X-box Live games.  This one functions well for voice, receiving is clear and adjustable volume control is crisp and static-free, mic is clear and picks up properly the person wearing it, not all the background noise like his X-box brand did.  Headset is adjustable and fits him well, he says it is very comfortable (I tried it too, and I think it is comfortable too) even for long playing sessions.  Cables appear rugged enough for their intended use (don't need armor-plated cables for X-box, lol).  Comparing these to the Microsoft branded headsets in the store, I can find little difference in appearance.  No complaints here for a $5 headset!

UPDATE:
I made the comment that cables appear ""rugged enough for their intended use""... but I may be wrong... it appears the wiring inside the cables is very cheap and thin... the microphone stopped working after only two weeks of use.  Hopefully its just a contact issue... for what I paid, I'll check the wiring - For now, I've ordered a different headset with better reviews and reliability comments....

UPDATE2:
After checking the headset thoroughly, I've determined the microphone pick-up is defective (internal wiring is cheap, braided-aluminum hair-thin wires, but all connections are good), and even though I could fix it with upgraded parts, its just not worth the effort or cost.  Amazon is fantastic and has accepted a return on it with full refund.  I've got a Plantronics (name brand I trust for microphone/headsets) on the way.

"I never thought I'd have to post a bad review of a game in the Final Fantasy franchise, but here goes.

I don't know what the game designers were thinking with this. The ""plot"" is virtually non-existant. The game is basically a series of battles. There are no puzzles, nothing in particular to unlock except new battles, and very little sense of progress. There's virtually nil NPC interaction and nothing to figure out. If I wanted a game that was nothing but combat, I wouldn't be playing FF, i'd break out my old copy of the PC dos-based Dungeon Hack (which is exactly what it sounds like).

The laws are arbitrary. Restrictions on what kind of combat you're allowed to engage in SHOULD make a game interesting (they at least keep you from overspecializing in, say, warriors or wizards). But when the game arbitrarily and randomly decides ""you can't use weapons in this battle"" or ""you can't use magic in this battle"" with no real rationale, you just start to get annoyed with it. A MUCH better way of preventing over specialization is to throw the player up against a wider variety of monsters so that they MUST have multiple classes to be able to play to all the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.

I also really dislike the idea of gaining skills by equiping certain items (instead of, oh, you know, USING the skills in question?). The result is that you end up equipping really weak and generally useless items for longer than you conceivably would in any other game, or you end up lacking very basic skills. Both are artificially limiting.

Overall, I think the game just lacks a lot of what makes the Final Fantasy franchise such a popular one, and that's a shame, especially consider how good the original Tactics is supposed to be. This is the first time I've ever NOT finished an FF game that I bought. Not because it was difficult, but because it was mind-numbing.",1.0

First one was totally defected. On/off bottom doesn't respond, flashing light never turn to solid light to read signal. It took long time and hassle to setting up in first one.

I decided return with unbelievably messed opened package. It's impossible to open neatly without cutter. They need to change design package to open more easily.

Next one was exchanged at Walmart and this was last chance for me, if it's not working it will turn refund. It read signal so quick like what instruction said. Then tried some game and works great. Light never flushing back again till you turned off.
I think this is good item if you lucky enough to buy non defected one. You might need try several item to meet one works great so I recommend to purchase near your home.

  This game is boring af! Not only is it boring, but the gameplay and graphics are extremely outdated. I felt like I was playing a PS3 game the entire time. The repetition in this game is infuriating. This is more of an interactive anime than a video game. When your not watching cutscenes or reading dialogue, you're basically doing mundane task, and very rarely the game gives you an opportunity to battle. Battling is very anticlimactic, because the combat system is a throw back to 1995.

"There is only one word to describe Deca Sports.  Terrible.  And disturbingly enough, one issue makes it stand out as being worse than it actually is over a couple of other issues that aren't even as glaring.  If you thought Deca Sports was going to be another Wii Sports, you were wrong.  The end result is a game that wasn't even close to doing the things Wii Sports did right.

If there was anything Deca Sports did better than Wii Sports it's that they put more games into the compilation.  Some that are a little strange to see, but other wise, it's more than just five games.  Deca Sports gives you ten.  Some are fine to include.  Such as Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball.  Even Archery doesn't feel out of place.  Not everything seems like it fits into place (Figure Skating?) but at the very least, you're still getting a lot of fun games.  Unfortunately, it takes very few tips from Nintendo in terms of the controls.

There's nothing too intuitive about the control scheme.  Most of them are fairly simple, but the first big mistake about Deca is the simple fact that some of the controls make you do two things.  In basketball, for example, wagging the Wii Remote doesn't just make you shoot.  It also makes you pass.  This means you might find yourself passing the ball when you really wanted to shoot.  So you've got some pretty loose controls.  But the bigger problem is that the controls are unresponsive in several instances.  Much of the lack of fun comes from the fact that the controls don't always respond.  This isn't just every once and a while.  This is often.

But the truth is, most of the games just aren't that interesting or fun to play.  The lack of responsive controls can make multiplayer a drag.  But the lack of any sort of challenge can make playing the actual game a drag.  Most of the AI is pretty bad.  Usually not even giving you much competition.  Even in Wii Sports the computer seemed to do something when you played against them.  Despite some unresponsive controls from time to time, you still have a good shot of beating the AI.  Because they spend a lot of time not even trying.  Sometimes even doing nothing at all.

There are a couple of minor issues surrounding Deca Sports.  The first being that you can't use your Miis.  Even though a lot of the characters in the game actually look like Miis.

The saddest part about Deca Sports is that the game could've easily been a good game.  A lot of the ideas for some of the sports aren't bad, but the game overall just feels unfinished.  That, and the simple fact that it just can't compare to Wii Sports.  Deca Sports has some games that are actually good for a sports compilation if you change up a few controls in some of them and just make the controls work.  Games like Archery and Volleyball aren't half bad in terms of ideas for another compilation.

In the end, Deca Sports feels like a game that was made for the sole purpose of cashing in on the success of the Wii and the phenomenon of Wii Sports.  Unfortunately, it's mini games don't play as well and they're not nearly as fun as some of Wii Sports best games.  Save your money.  Wii Sports is still a better choice.  Even at thirty dollars, Deca Sports is a waste.",1.0

There's really only one big negative, and it has to be that I always feel like it's going to break. It feels cheaply made, its constantly getting knocked off center by my cats, me, my dogs tails, anything. I feel like the USB ports are going to snap off inside. It just feels flimsy. I can't complain too much as I only paid about $7, but iafter only a few hours of using it, all I can think about is how the USB ports are going to break. The charging ports aren't very deep either and something is constantly bumping my controller off the charging station. My cats like to lay near/on top of my PlayStation because it's so warm so that's why they're always hitting it.

The worst problem is the same RMT companies have bots out in force, making many places unplayable already.

NCSoft West's response to this has been tepid at best, with occasionally one or two bans being announced; the spammers and bots number in the hundreds per server (I have witnessed this first-hand).

"I was so disappointed in this game pad. I purchased hoping for a better ergonomic setup which it was. It felt good but the software with it is absolutely horrendous. It didn't help that the lighting on one key was dead out of the box and the ""guaranteed"" delivery date was missed. Not only is the software very hard to see and read with dark grey letters on a grey background but it difficult to use and seems to lose settings. I spent over two hours setting up the software so I could play and it just randomly lost the settings with no way to recover.

During my couple hours with this device, the software locked up once and had to be restarted and also when it appeared to be working it randomly lost key settings and needed full reconfiguration.

Ergonomically it seemed great and I saw no issues in my short time with it physically other than one key light being DOA. Had the software been just half good I would have simply exchanged the unit but the software in my opinion is pretty much unusable with lockups and lost settings. So it's on it's way back to Amazon and I will give the Logitech key pad a try.",1.0

Well, in addition to copying/pasting the same characters from TF2 they actually had the balls to create some of their own classes called ""tanks"" who are basically very overpowered - so there is some originality I suppose. Except the scout, the demoman, engineer etc are yep, copy and pasted!

Someone has the talent at Blizzard to use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V at least. But oh dear, what's this? The graphics are no better than TF2 almost ten years later! You have to wonder what influence time travel has on developments of games. Oh dearie me, oh dearie me. It's a sad day foer the gaming industry. Copy and paste really played a great part in the development of Overwatch, while the gods salute the creator of such a great function... and it didn't cost Blizzard a thing. The worst part is they charged full price, when they could have actually just called is a remaster of TF2 for six quid.

It's not a terrible game but paying $60 for this is really a joke. TF2 is free on Steam and looks exactly the same, it really is that simple. Oh dearie me.",1.0

"Overwatch is Blizzard Activision's latest project. Blizzard is a company that is getting by on the accolades of it's past, but educated people seem to be in agreement that it's been going downhill lately. Although the game takes on a lot of personality amidst a large roster, it still leaves a lot to be desired. In my review I want to touch on the great points and the not so great points. The original price already seems far too generous for how what you get.

Quick Summary = Overwatch is a team based shooter where each team has 6 (now unique) heroes. There are two teams and neither team has any identity separating them from the other. The roster is separated in roles within the game that are entirely optional(meaning the roles do not have to be filled). Shortly after release a competitive gaming mode was established, as are in most Blizzard games as well as FPS games.

Now I'll give my thoughts on..
Pro's+
+The universe is expansive and unique from other blizzard projects, there is much unknown as well as much to be discovered
+The characters do give fans something to identify with
+The Pixaresque animation style seems interesting enough and seems to pull in a younger generation of gamers
+The Overwatch team puts in a lot into media to help illustrate the ideas they want within the world
+Blizzard has always had a very creative art team that explores cultures

Neg's -
-To start things off I'll first introduce the tutorial, you play as Soldier 76 and experience game play similar to a traditional FPS except the aiming and firing are completely wonky. The aiming in this game feels a lot like halo for some reason. Furthermore there is no real introduction to how to play the game unless you're going to play against humans. Mainly because bots are either unrealistically slow and inaccurate or the other side of the spectrum where they just are walking wall hackers.
-The game seems somewhat political as Blizzard is using it to appease an audience opposed to just pleasing their player base. An example is the whole tracer controversy.
-This game has seasonal ""free content"" that it'll later remove. The free content is mostly focused on cosmetics opposed to things in the game that people actually want such as new maps and heroes. These cosmetic items are usually on a two week timer and if you don't have time to play you'll usually just end up forking money to just get icons, sprays, and voice lines. Activision is pretty scummy like that.
-The matchmaking in this game is pretty bad. If you're an excellent/superior player it doesn't really matter because you can carry with one of the more broken heroes in the game such as Genji who has been broken since launch. If you are average or sub average, prepare to play against people of higher skill that'll pretty much keep you at your spawn..
-Because of the aforementioned a lot of the fun/appreciation within the game seems hardly present as frustration seems omnipresent or ""saltiness"" over one's shortcomings. Believe me, I really want to have fun but playing against a ""pro genji"" that just kills my team will entirely ruin any sense of fun. A lot of people say ""just play with friends,"" I was playing with my friends and now none of us talk to each other and get extremely salty. We've pretty much all have stopped playing too.
-There are problems with the servers for other regions, Blizzard chooses to ignore those problems and because of that they come into a foreign region and lag things up. Because of this there are a lot of frustrating matches where you can't do anything.
-Because it's a big game with a younger audience there are a lot of trolls that'll harass you.

This is my review for the game, granted my opinion won't reflect everyone's opinion and will be seen largely as the minority. I think it's an overglorified piece of garbage and if any other company aside from the ""beloved"" Blizzard team developed it, it would have been mocked just like paladins was.",1.0
"Now take into consideration that this follows the same trend as all COD games: just a remake of a past game, does not use servers (uses 1990s host connection/matching), laggy, buggy, rushed.

That being said, this game has really taken the cake on failure. I've wrote a lot of reviews on Amazon with only this one being the negative review, I usually write reviews on all my products, so I am not merely a negative nancy over here. Anyways, this game has a roughly 3 hour campaign, which is pitiful by today's standards. There are roughly 3 guns to use in multiplayer and the snipers, any other guns make no sense and show the pitiful excuse for programming that has become Infinity Ward. With as much money as Activision makes for these games and the DLC's, you would think they could pay for dedicated servers and fix the lag issues. And of course this being a rushed COD game, TONS! of lag. People glitch and hack their way past so many things in the game, it shows that Activision has without a doubt began to ignore the older consoles.

Anyways past the short campaign, past the lack of servers, past the lack of usable weapons, past the lag, past the hackers, past activision ignoring their customers, past the poor programming, it is still a horrible game",1.0

"NBA Live 2006 is crap, that game is just all about dunking and the super powers of the players, the physicas are totally unrealistic. Any time you post up, it usually leads to you getting the ball stripped. For some reason and (I really really hate this) teams have a very hard time getting defensive rebounds in this game. There's nothing like getting a rare possesion in this game where you actually play solid defense and force a missed shot, only to have the offensive player slam dunk it back in your face while the defensive player just stands there like an idiot, which happends every time.

NBA Live 2005 was way way better. I'm already passed NBA Live 2006, but NBA Live 2005 is a classic I still play. There's no real flaws in this game. If you have a dominate big man, then you will dominate the paint and have a good chance of scoring, if they double team, you can find open guys for shots. You need to have an offensive plan and know what kind of team you are. sloppy offense leads to steals and missed shots which lead to fast break chances for the other team.",1.0

"The flaws in this game are myriad in number. The most prominent is that you can pay $100 and not be able to come close to completion. You only get three characters and you cannot even complete ANY of the free play with these characters. All you get is story mode, three miserable adventure worlds, and only three red bricks. This games is not even really that much bigger than all the other Lego games that have come out in the past 3 years, and I have played all of the them so I know what I'm talking about. The worlds on Lego Dimensions are so small that Minas Tirith is only about fifty feet away from Hobbiton in the Lord of the Rings world! To those who are wondering if they should buy this game, I would say that you can buy three or four other really good and enjoyable LEGO games for less than the price of this partial game. Lego Batman 2 has a Gotham City free world which is much larger than any world than this game has. The Middle-Earth of Lego The Lord of the Rings is at least three times bigger than this game's version. Lego Marvel has a large free world New York and in Lego Batman 3 you can visit all of the Lantern Worlds. Furthermore, in all of these games, you can buy all of the characters, complete all of the free play, collect all of the gold bricks and red bricks, and complete the game to 100%. The best part is that you can buy all of this for less than what Lego is now charging for one INCOMPLETE game. People have said that this game is worth $100 and more , but I would say that several complete Lego games that are still perfectly fun, entertaining, and valid are worth FAR FAR more. I would spare anyone the expense of this game in favor something cheaper and just as lastingly good.

A flaw that I see in the Starter Pack is that legos come with it. The legos alone that are involved send the price out the roof. At least with other games you could choose whether or not to buy corresponding legos, and if did want to then you could pick and choose which ones to buy in relation to how much money you could afford to spend at the time. I am not against the legos that come with this game. I just don't think you should have to pay the extra expense just to receive the game. The old system of buying legos and Lego games separately is better and definitely a lot cheaper.

When someone completes this game to 100%, please comment on how much it costed to do so.

For further entertainment, check out the older LEGO games that came out on the Xbox 360 like LEGO Indiana Jones, LEGO Batman, and LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga. Although these games do not have open worlds, flight, and other things that the newer games have, it is their simplicity and fun that made LEGO games popular. They cost about $20 each.",1.0

"Firstly, I am a big Star Wars fan, Battlefront 2 fan, and Battlefield fan.

This game is a horrible experience. It looks good but that's it. The gameplay is some of the worst I've ever experienced in a recent shooter. I'm not a big fan of COD but even the recent COD's have better balance and spawning. Spawning is horrible. Getting killed right after spawning in is extremely common. Gunplay is really bad. This game lacks content severely. No campaign! Do you realize how cool a good Star Wars campaign would be? Too bad the Star Wars license is stuck with EA. Very few guns--very few maps-- a fraction of base game content, in comparison to EA's previous shooters. Apparently they crammed everything in DLC.

I'll go back to playing BF4--atleast I can have a good time in that game and it has a good variety of content.

So, Hardline was weak and Battlefront is even worse. Boy oh boy I hope to God that this trend does not continue when the next Battlefield title comes out. I have my fingers crossed.",1.0

Then, my new pc had an issue and the techs told me that I needed to refresh my system. Not an issue as I could surely re-load this. Yeah, right.

I was able to get my pc up and running and decided to reload Homefront. When I put in the purchase code, I received a ""Duplicate Record Error"" and it suggested I contact Steam. I did contact them. This proved to be nothing more than a lesson in patience. Their customer service and support is simply a series of emails. You do not talk to anyone. I sent them all the data I had about the purchase from Amazon. This was fruitless.

As a result, I simply gave up. Steam's support is simply designed to frustrate the user until they simply give up. That was my take-away from all of this. As a result, and I told them this when THEY closed my ticket out, that I would N-E-V-E-R purchase another Steam product again no matter what. It is not worth the aggravation. No offense to Amazon's Customer Support but they were of no real help either.

The whole cartoon like theme to the game is off-putting and unusual.  The graphics of the beta just did not seem to live up to the standards I would have expected.  Command and Conquer 3 had excellent graphics and seems to have set the bar too high for Red Alert 3.

I have since been massively deterred by the negative reviews and stories of the DRM security feature of this game.  I have had more than 5 computers in the past 8 years and if my previous C&C games were infected with this terrible feature then I would have many games that are unplayable.

"UPDATE 08/24/13:
After months of letting this sit, I decided to try again. I downloaded all the drivers and firmware, but nothing. When I plug it in, my computer notifies me that a device has been entered in one of the USB ports, but the Recon3D doesn't light up. I doubt it's the Tactic Link card in it.
I downloaded Creative's updater, and it recognizes the device when it's plugged in, but the update constantly fails. It's a shame because I loved it when it worked. Now it's a paperweight.

Also, I never heard back from Creative after my last email earlier this year.

UPDATE 04/21/13:
DEAD!
My Recon3D is dead. Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.
I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.

UPDATE 12/13/11:
I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.

Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.

It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.

----------

Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it? With their own products?
Unfortunately, that isn't the case.

While I have praised the Recon3D, that's only because I'm using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That's where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don't have the necessary cable to accomplish that.

Therefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don't even get the necessary (""optional,"" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can't even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can't connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone ""optional"" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.

It's a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here's where it stops.",1.0

"Diablo 3 entreats us to try our luck and seek out ultimate treasures and magical shiny things to defeat diablo.

I ventured forth into Diablo land full of hope with treasure hunting stars in my eyes and and found pile upon pile of useless junk.  About 50 hours later at the end of a long dark lonely repetitive questing journey, exhausted and disheartened I found the magical Diablo auction house.

The friendly auction house personal entreated me to return to the magical Diablo lands and collect junk for many additional hours to sell it to venders and use that money to buy the treasures that exploiters, cheaters, and paid-to-play people found in their oh so magically lucky adventuring lives and then posted for sale on auction house.

Leaving the auction house I returned to Diablo Land and proceeded to spend many more hours repeatedly killing the same monsters again and again, collecting piles of magical trash again and again.  I returned to the auction house to buy my ""end game"" gear and finally progress my adventure.

A smile on my face I ventured into act 2 Inferno.  Stepped off of the portal and into ...  everything went black and there was sand in my mouth.  Restart.... again sand....restart...again face full of sand.  I think i remember hearing some kind of humming or buzzing noise but I can't be sure.

I returned to the magical Diablo land to collect magical Diablo land trash, sell trash to vendor, take gold from trash sale to auction house.  Give gold to game exploiters and professional players or maybe even just plain lucky people.  Have MUCH better level 60 gear and charts and diagrams on how to play and which skill to use.

I am ready to tackle whatever it is that is causing me to faceplant.  I haven't really seen it yet but now I know I'm ready for it.  This time its going to be VERY different.  Very VERY different!

I step off the portal and yes indeed it is very different.  I see a flash of blue, and then the sand, and then the blackness....I totally never saw the flash of blue before.  I'm pretty sure I heard that buzzing noise again though.

I am older and wiser now,  I exited Diablo land, the auction house people brushed the sand off of me and gave me some water to get the grittiness out of my mouth.  They told me of shiny swords, sparkly rings of life on hit, and gloves with additional attack speed.

"I didn't like this game.  I play games as a way to relax between work, a way to escape, a way to keep my mind stimulated.  Alida didn't do this for me.  Most of the time I wasn't quite sure why I was running back and forth doing things, and I never could figure out the whole logic (or whatever) with setting the planets in those covered trays and had to do them all trial and error (and must have done them wrong since there was no indication when you got them right--the other segments had some means of letting you know when things were set correctly).  When I finally go to the part where all the various items had been fiddled with and the lost chord should have played to open the vaults, nothing happened.  I sat there for a minute thinking about what was probably off and decided that whatever the ending, it had to be pretty sucky since the beginning premise was pretty lame--and I decided it wasn't worth going back and refiguring anything.  I just uninstalled it, took the game to work for someone else to try (for free).  There was no initial reason for me (as the hero) to want to go find whatever-the-woman's-name-was boyfriend (I'm rather sick of someone telling me something needs to be done, I've gotten to the point where I'm going, ""why can't you do it yourself you lazy bum???"") and since adjusting all those gizmos didn't give me any incentive, I didn't feel any need to successfully complete the game.  I seriously could not think of anything good (or interesting) happening if I'd just go back and correct my wrong setting--so I uninstalled.

"This remote seems to be getting a lot of hate and after pairing it with my PS4 and getting some time to setup and operate the remote it gets a middle-of-the-road score from me. A lot of complaints surrounding this remote are totally valid but I still found the remote to be fairly decent and it does have some redeeming qualities.

The Bad:
(-) Overall I don't particularly like the form factor of the remote. It's much smaller than the PS3 BT remote control that came before it and as a result many of the buttons are tiny. In particular the PS4 face buttons are tiny and poorly positioned making them difficult to use.

(-) For a remote with such small keys you'd think there would be a backlighting feature. But no such luck. Finding extra small keys in a darkened room while watching a movie sucks.

(-) The remote is missing buttons you'd expect to have. None of the shoulder buttons (L1, R1, etc) get a button.

(-) Much like the PS3 BT remote if PS4 is the selected device on this remote any button acts like a power button and turns on the PS4.

(-) Batteries (2x AAA) are not included.

The Good:
(+) I do like the button click when a button is pressed. It's much more tactile than on the PS3 BT remote.

(+) Volume Punch-through is very easy to setup and controls the volume on the TV (a Panasonic plasma in my case) even when another device is selected (e.g. PS4).

(+) Setting up the universal control features was pretty easy - either by manually inputting remote codes or using the learning feature (covered in the included instructions).

--------------------
UPDATE 11/17/2015:
--------------------
I've had the chance to use the PS4 Universal Remote more and more with my PS4, mainly using Netflix and Amazon VOD, and now I'm understanding the hate this remote gets. So two major issues have cropped up and unless there's a dramatic turnaround I'm probably going to scrap this remote altogether. Also, changing my review from 3 to 1-star.

Issue #1: BT Connectivity -
After initially working without issues my remote now seemingly cannot stay paired. The remote seems to enter rest-mode but has trouble waking. I end up having to push random buttons in the hopes of finally getting the remote to wake and work.

Issue #2: Battery Drain -
I'm on my second pair of brand new AAA batteries. The last pair of fresh batteries was put in the remote and less than 24-hrs later the remote (through the PS4) reported that it was low on battery power.",1.0
This game was not what i thought it would be. to get around is confusing at best. i was prepared for voice acting there are voices but the characters don't really move and do not move thier mouths either. you sometimes find yourself going around in circles. the scenery is pretty but i got bored very easily,1.0
"Am I in love with this 5 dollar keyboard, Logitech is selling for 150 dollars. Logitech knows this.
I know it. They won't tell you about it, but I'm here, and I'm telling you - Stay Away.
Unless you value the 'experience' more than you do a working product years from now.

Customer support will not help when your keyboard experiences normal abuse, because thin
cheap plastic is not a design flaw in their opinion. Be right back, bubble wrapping my world from harm.

Just for sport, I'll list some other experiences that have helped me reconsider the Logitech brand.

""G502 - scroll wheel rattle, rough textured glide.""
""K800 - spacebar seated higher than the rest of the keys, squeaky keys.""
""G510s - backlight causes palm rest to heat, keys do not stay depressed(low tolerance) and are quite stiff.""
""G402 - mouse feet can peel, the side grip rubber can cause blisters.""
""G100s - the clicks are quite flimsy, and clicking near the dpi button can cause accidental actuation.""
""G910 - thin plastic housing for the switches and probably the cheapest keycaps out there. the plastic/texture used for the wrist rest can cause it to stick to the hand.""
""G9x - electrical noise, and mouse wheel breaks too easily.""

--

But I won't say every experience I've had is less than ideal.

""Logitech iTouch keyboard is quite good.""
""G400 styled mice seem worthy of their praise.""
""G302 style mice are a bit uncomfy but overall seem quite good.""

--

Now, why did I buy this keyboard?

Well, first up, from the overall appearance and knowing the keycaps likely come from a vendor who's known for poor
quality plastic, I figure the board is not the most quality thing out there, but that support
wouldn't have any problems replacing the product.

But still, the keycaps were different. And with a painful finger I considered that
the awkward keycaps might do the trick.

Also, being a fan of simple, yet ergonomic designed rubber domes such as the Dell sk8115, the bottom row keys
seemed to be tailored with a bit more comfort in mind.

--

After using this keyboard for some time, point 1 doesn't stand, as support does not care to replace
a keyboard designed for failure. Really, I considered that the keycap would break before the actual switch, not
the other way around.

Point 2, the keycaps don't really feel all that great. Sometimes they don't bother you,
sometimes they do. But by their aggressive design, who's going to really feel like they're
immersed in whatever they're doing without feeling like they're using some awkward G910 keycaps.

Point 3, The bottom row is also not as comfortably designed as I feel they should be. The space bar still has a pointed
edge, and the modifier keys are kinda weak in feel and shape.

There is one thing I figure this keyboard has over others, and that is that it does seem to feel just a bit more responsive
in key actuation than others, but at the cost of a less immersive experience.
The keys are somewhat shallow and the bottom-out tactility of a K70 will not be felt here,
as the bottom-out is softened to a high degree. Further, the tactile bump going down is not too bothersome,
but when slowly releasing a key the tactile bump is a lot more evident as it kinda sticks there for a while before resetting fully. Some of this could be to aid comfort when resting just below the bump, the bottom-out noise, and the harshness of the bottom-out. But I feel it is a little bit much and keeps the switch from a smoother, and more comfortably un-shallow feel.

In the end, I never did stick to using the keyboard for any extended period of time. And maybe I'll reconsider if quality is improved.",1.0

The large size, odd shape and brightly colored buttons pretty much guarantee that you'll look a complete tool if you try to use it as a phone.
As if that wasn't bad enough, the interface is complicated and confusing; don't expect to be able to pick it up and use it without reading the manual.
For the price of an N-Gage you could get a refurb iPod, a t68i and a GBA-SP. Sure, three devices, but three devices that together take up about the same amount of space, while being much more suited to their respective tasks than this jack-of-all-trades.",1.0

Each player has about 10 moves apiece, the opponent gets up the moment you knock him down, even with ""high impact"" moves.  Then to top off the crappy controls and lack of moves, you start out with less than 10 wrestlers to pick from.  Honestly, I think they could have left this game in production for a couple more months and tweaked it a little.  The WWE Smackdown vs Raw games are just more realistic and have better, much better moves.  If you are looking to play this game, I suggest you drink a lot.",1.0

The game lacks replay value past the initial thrill of HD batman and a basic unoriginal story. I say that because of the missing challenge maps and lack of mission selection after completion. After you beat the game it becomes a bland open world with random AI to fight. While the graphics are nice it needs more batman combat and replay.

"Let me start this off by saying up until this point, Treyarch and Black Ops have been my favorite.  We've purchased every CoD game since 07/08ish.  I am not a big time gamer.  I'm not an excellent CoD player, but I am OK.  8/10 games on previous games I'd go positive.  I would say I was somewhat confident in my game play skills going into Black Ops 3.  Normally after a few games and figuring out the maps I'm decent, if not good.  I figured it'd be the same way with BO3... WRONG.  SO WRONG.  This game is horrific.

MP: I'm lucky if I get more than three kills and die less than 25 times.  I don't feel like it's always me as a player either.  I'll clearly be shooting someone and I get no hit markers.  I'll come up behind someone and start shooting and they magically have the ability to turn around, shoot, and kill me.. all the while I am shooting them.  I feel like I die ridiculously easy.  I know when I've been outskilled versus the game just hating me.  I am CONSTANTLY lagging.  Every game I'm bouncing from the full bars down to one bar.  Bouncing around everywhere.  It's awful.  Parties?  Ha, good luck.  I have a group of four people and we had no problems playing together in Advanced Warfare or Ghosts.  It's like winning the lottery if BO3 will let us all play together.  I thought it was maybe our internet that was causing all of these issues, so we decided to try Advanced Warfare again and test out whether it was us or BO3.  Definitely not us.  I rarely lag on AW and don't have an issue with parties.  At first I thought I just sucked and I was in denial, but reading the amazon reviews and some reddit posts I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE!

Zombies: Would have been one of the only redeeming qualities except they seemed to some how F that up too.  To buy a gun off the wall you have to be looking at it in just the right way at exactly the right spot or it doesn't work.  In Zombies of the past you just had to be close to it, hell even slightly brush by it, and you had a new gun.  Extremely frustrating when you have a train of zombies following you and you can't easily purchase a gun.  Becoming the beast is an interesting aspect and makes it fun, but the human sacrifices, and gateworms and whatever the hell else you have to do just to upgrade your gun is kind of crazy.  Man, do I miss Kino Der Toten.

"I purchased this game on launch day and went through the crazy nightmare that was trying to connect to a server. I didn't let the bad press keep me from giving the game a shot and I waited. I waited for several days, then several weeks, and then eventually at the 1 month mark I decided to give it a rest and try again several months later. I reinstalled the game just yesterday and though I can connect to a server now, the broken gameplay elements from day 1 are still present and make the game pretty much unplayable in my eyes.

Traffic is still managed incredibly poorly, and I've literally had to build non-continuous streets to ensure the maximum number of right turns are available, since 4-way intersections pretty much clog up traffic to horrid levels. Even with public transportation systems built in and bus stops all over the place it is just a nightmare just trying to help sims get around town. And I don't know who decided not to build subway stations, which would've significantly alleviated the traffic problems. The entire education system is broken still, with my nuclear power plants having meltdowns despite having an entire university with nearly every department available for my city. I don't know what system is managing the flow of workers, but I keep getting un-skilled workers flooding my job market while my own city just falls apart.

I even built a city using just cheat codes because I just wanted to build a cool city that was really-high tech to bypass the mess of problems I was having in building something the old fashioned way - and even then everything doesn't work. I can't even hire workers for my power plant to get anything to run so I just keep hemorrhaging money as I desperately try to figure out what's wrong. I even built a neighboring city with the sole purpose of providing power, and that STILL doesn't fix the issue.

Also, the city size as many have noted is just incredibly tiny. There is no way you can build a bustling metropolis unless you invest heavily in time and energy into many smaller cities just to support the 1-2 big ones and continuously invest and upgrade. While that was one of the fun parts I was looking forward to doing in sim city, the fact that they force me to struggle just to manage even the most basic tasks ruins the experience almost entirely. Simply put, you will very likely get incredibly frustrated and angry just trying to play the game because of how fundamentally broken it as and because you're just not having fun. It's not the good kind of challenge where you're interested and want to find a way to accomplish the goal. This game is more an exercise in futility as you struggle to get even the most basic tasks to work.

If you are looking for a fun way to build a city and have a good time watching it grow...pick up one of the earlier sim city games. Avoid this title and send the message to EA and Maxis that we won't stand for a game that cannot run properly several months into its release.

"... do not buy this game.  Don't rent this game, either.  In fact, don't even borrow it from a friend thinking, ""Hey, I'm not paying any money and I have a few hours to kill, so what could I lose?""

This is easily one of the worst RPGs I have ever had the misfortune to play.  Ever.  The plot is contrived at best due in part to an absolutely ATROCIOUS translation (which can't settle on how to spell the names of important places/people).  The psuedo-new-age music seems to be interesting for the first five minutes, but the utter lack of variety in the soundtrack had me wanting to claw at my eardrums so I wouldn't have to suffer through it any more.

The battle system is very broken; you could be standing right in front of a monster and still not hit it no matter how much you swing at the fool thing.  The upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken.  You need to repair your weapons and armor every few monsters you kill; more often if you use the special abilities certain items grant you.  And this is VERY expensive.  I was so frustrated because it seemed like by the time I'd killed enough monsters to recoup the cost of the last repairs, it was time to repair again.

The only redeeming feature of this game is the graphics.  Even though they're a little crude by today's standards, they're still nice to look at in some cases.  Also, the character model will change depending on your equipment, so your character could be running around with a pumpkin on her head or a metal pot on his head.

"Lack of balance...if one thing could be pointed at as the problem, it is the lack of balance.

The battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didn't pan out. As has been mentioned, the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle. Also, the monotony of the enemies left me wanting. During one area of the game, in the Sandsea, I had a chain of 164, I wasn't trying to get chain points, either. No matter how good the battle system was designed, 164 of the same enemy, in a row, gets boring.

The license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in FFX. I loved the sphere grid, wasn't so fond of this system. Obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success, requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure. At level 20, Penelope had cleared the Magick section of the grid, although, her highest level magick that was of use was Cura...hardly an impressive skill.

The storyline was like riding a snail. Too many cut-scenes and not enough interesting developments. The gil distribution was down-right ridiculous. Leveling up for hours, exploring every nook-and-cranny of a dungeon, and still not having enough money to improve your weapons...there just wasn't a good balance. There needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting, in past games, leveling up was just as fun as progressing the story...it felt like a necessary chore in FFXII. For nearly every enemy I remember, you got 1 license point per kill. By a rough estimation, 1800 enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing system.

The last rant was the character classes, or lack of. Any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want (for a necessary price). While the openness can be good, it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost. After all, so what if Vaan gets that new axe when Basche is right behind (note: I mentioned a weapon...there are no special abilities unique to any character, either).

Between the lack of rewards, gil, ability increases with experience, and monotony of battles, I would not recommend this game. I put 20 hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt (the mini-games are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about, comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous FF games). I believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental. Naturally, another person may like everything I ranted on above. Like any FF game, you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addicted...I lost interest in the middle of the addiction-stage.",1.0

When i read online unfortunately a lot of people  faced this problem with intercoolers cause they use a lot of power from the Xbox not allowing the Xbox to function as required. it also voids the warranty of your Xbox. A lot of people toasted their Xbox because of this and i was lucky enough to remove it after it did that a couple of times without toasting my Xbox. I am surprised seeing good reviews about this but if you don't believe me do your research online before you buy.",1.0

"its really call of duty plus robots.

good move; trying to mimic call of duty such that fans would switch over. and then adding robots (they know Asians love technology and mechas)

very good marketing strategy. but a weak game on an inferior console isn't going to fool gamers.

have seen many girls boasting about titanfall and claiming to be gamers. that's because all the guys are playing Call of Duty on the Ps4.

I really don't see what people talk about. I don't see the magic. The guns feel weak and toy like. Perhaps what annoys me the most are the 12 year old kids that skip school to play.

"These companies are just trying to make a buck on those who are careless with the screen!

"The above product does not work on Mac OSX with the following versions. It may be some sort of bug, but the problem lies in the directional pads not being reset back to a 0 counter. This means that the directions get stuck (namely the right and down). The function of the controllers have been tested (I tried 4 SNES controllers that are constantly used on my SNES console) and they appear to work fine on Windows 7 ultimate (no other installs to test);

I read from a previous reviewer that they was having the same issue. On a whim I attempted a few controller apps (ControllerMate and USB Overdrive) both of which detected the controller just fine, but alas, had the same problem. I can show an output file if needed from ControllerMate.

basically what happens when you push a direction on a controller button is simple math. +1 or -1 is added to 0. Normally the controller resets to 0 automatically when you do not press anything. unfortunately, the number instead stays at +1 for both X and Y axis (which happens to be right and down, respectively.)

Overall the design of the product is not bad, the chord is very hard plastic, and the plastic they used for the housing seems to be close to the SNES plastic. If it worked I would have rated it 5 star. I will simply return it and continue to use other controllers until I can get a working replacement.",1.0

"Resident Evils 1&2 for the original Playstation are two of the best games ever made.  RE2 alone surpasses nearly all the other horror based games that were created for the consule, and there were plenty to follow.  With the evolution of the new gaming systems came new Resident Evil games.  RE Nemsis proved to be a challenging game of cat and mouse.  RE Survivor squandered in its attempt to switch the horror genre to the first person.  Now Resident Evil is back on the Playstation after some new titles under the Nintendo name.  The suspsense and antcipation for the game were killing me so I quickly bought it when it was released in April of this year.  Little did I know that the game itself would kill me.  RE Outbreak is quite frankly the most dissapointing horror game in the storied franchise.  The game is bad, very bad, and it has a number of reasons why.  First, you can not turn a survial based game into a team effort.  The fact that you have to help nearly everyone in this game just as much as yourself is ridiculous.  The game doesn't allow you to focus on the tasks and puzzles at hand, not to mention the 5 billion zombies that are thrown your way.  The loading screens are absolutely agonizing.  They were never good on the PSOne, so you think with the adaption to the PS2 this minor glich would get cleared up.  Oops.  The story is slow, the characters are dull, and the constant reptitive lines spoken by them is enough to make you want to turn into a zombie.  Oh wait, you can in this game, and then kill all of your teammates.  What?  Who came up with that brillant idea?  With such a storied past you think Capcom would play off its original success.  Instead, Resident Evil Outbreak is dead on arrival.",1.0
"...  In more ways then one, it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye, but fails miserably.  Considering this game was made after Goldeneye, you would think it would at least have quality graphics, but no.  Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating, where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character.  The missions are vrey booring too.  This game is very hard even on the ""possible"" setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.
Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game.",1.0

"So I loved Shattered dimensions.  I found it to be a lot of fun and engaging.  It was not as good as Arkham Asylum but it was an excellent game in its own right.  With all of that love for that game I pre-ordered this game. Big Mistake.  This time around there are just so many problems.

1) Story makes no sense at all and quantum causality really?  So to show you that your choices in the past matter as you complete certain tasks it will change the future.  By erasing minions and obstacles from existence in the past and clearing it for the future. Go rent Bill & Teds Bogus Journey and when the are in the final face-off against their opponent in that movie you will see exactly how silly this game mechanic is. Bogus Journey will also be a better way to spend your time if you are interested just in story.
2)Camera angle.  The camera will straight up kill you in this game.  you will never see all of your opponents clearly.  There are many games that have bad camera angles this is just another one.  You must love the random enemy that you can not see but is killing you quickly but moves from where the shots came from to an equally unseen corner again.
3)Advanced fighting difficulty.  So if you aren't a casual gamer this isn't such a big issue.  But more enemies who are faster and knock you out of specials and combos make this much less rewarding.  This is where this game is suppose to shine and they made it harder to the detriment of most people who want to play and see what they can do.  The game goes from being fun and challenging to being a grind.
4)Boring visuals.  So in shattered dimensions you went through all these levels which reflected the personality of the bad guy you were facing.  This is one building in different times.  To add visual stimulus and try to distract you from how bad it is they put in blue swirly clouds that include faces and other pieces that are related to Peter.  But they remain basically the same instead of changing with however you play the story.  So its the same blue swirly cloud. That gets extremely boring and repetitive too.
5)Short and yet way too long.  This is not a long game until you realize you will never get back these hours in your life and that makes it much too long of a game.  This game never takes you away and many times as you try to play through it you realize it is just taking way to long in the worst possible way.

This is not a buy.  This is not a rent.  This is a skip.

I would love for the publisher to apologize for this being so bad.",1.0
"Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).

Some championship races and cars can only be ""unlocked"" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.

I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.

I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.

I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)

"This game suffers from so many problems. First, the load times between pages are really long and annoying. Second, the puzzles are boring ""find the item"" ones that require talking to everyone and clicking everywhere on the screen until you can advance the plot. Last, the game has bugs that cause it to crash and end unexpectedly. This was verified when I complained to technical support, there are major bug problems. For example, in the game you find a raft - but if you open it too far from the water you lose your progress and the game crashes. Dumb.",1.0

"Do not buy this game. I would rather play pac man. I am a hardcore fan of the Diablo series and it is clear that Blizzard made horrible decisions in the production of this game.

1) Online Only Play
2) Only 4 People can Play Together instead of 8 in Diablo 2
3) Every Character will have Every Spell in Equal Amounts. I feel like a Marxist created this game. I have no desire to recreate a character to give him different abilities, skill points, and vitality/strength/dexterity/intelligence points because everyone has the same everything if you are the same class! This means PVP will be solely based on items, and possibly skill selection. And everyone will use the same skills most likely in PVP. I watched a Blizzard developer in an interview basically say that they had a hard time balancing skill point development so they just got rid of it. Yeah well they ruined the game in part due to that.
4) The storyline is a saturday morning cartoon, but less entertaininng. The voiceovers are horrible. Characters do not even move their lips in movies when they talk, or if they do it is hardly noticeable.
5) Questing is like someone is holding your hand. The minimap pings where you need to go. Every quest is basically ""find this location or person"". And there is nothing unique about it. You do not have to match symbols on a wall like in the old Diablo 2 Act 2 or get a horadric cube to make a staff or ANYTHING. It is so cheap and dumbed down. Basically the whole game feels like a boss fight. CLICK CLICK CLICK.
5) The auction house idea was horrible. Now players willing to give blizzard more money are basically the winners and the people actually playing to find items will suffer.
6) The Monk is overpowered and the Barbarian sucks (I am level 33).
7) There are not enough classes.
8) Every act is monotonous boring. CLICK CLICK CLICK. The game as a whole is not that long though.
9) Online only play and no LAN play
10) Some Monsters are taken directly out of WoW.

That is just a short list, but you get the idea. I have not even mentioned the fact that in the first 2-3 days the servers have been down half the time. So much for that stress test or beta being any help.

This game basically feels like I am repeating 5 quests on WoW 8 hours at a time to complete an Act. Koreans are beating this game in under 2 hours. Ever since Blizzard screwed up SC2 (fast paced click fest now) I have questioned how they just remake a game, but screw it up and call it a sequel. The old blizz developers are off working for new companies. If Blizzard were smart they would bring them all back. There was so much more depth in Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1. There are no meta games in Diablo 3. I could teach a chimpanzee to play this game. The quests just really ruined it for me. I feel like I am playing a cartoon dumbed down version of Diablo 2. Do not even buy this for the novelty because there is none. I will play this for one week at most and then I will probably never play it again.",1.0

"Because of what I consider to be a significant flaw, this is a somewhat superficial review of Armored Core2. Armored Core 2 has great graphics and even, nicely designed missions, although it often requires you to repeat completly unnecessary dialogs and setup sequences even for repeat attempts that only serve to waste time. Aside from that though, it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw. The PS2 has really great analog controls. Armored Core 2 doesnt use them. They say they use analog control, but they only use the 2 analog sticks as single push buttons. How can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the PS2. This would be bad enough on its own, but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous. If something is shooting at you from behind, you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged. They also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity. I might add, that the AI mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech. It is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control. The design it yourself mech feature is really excellent, and if it weren't for the truly hobbling nature of the controls, this really would be a 5 star game.

"**UPDATE** Mad Katz support got back to me but ignored the info I sent them about it not entering pairing mode and tried to tell me it's because my computer doesn't have BT 4.0 (which is bunk- the computer is 2 weeks old, hot off the Apple assembly line- and yes, it has BT 4.0) and also that the mapping software that lets all the extra buttons function ONLY WORKS WITH THE DONGLE

with some fiddling I got it connected on the OSX side anyway, but the thing disconnects CONSTANTLY. Not only that but in games every time you enter a menu, when you exit, this mouse points your view straight up. Between that and the constant disconnects this mouse is absolutely worthless for everything, especially gaming. I'm not even going to bother trying it on the Windows 8 side. This thing is still junk.

In short-
Calling it a gaming mouse is misleading. It barely functions as a mouse
Calling it Bluetooth compatible is misleading since most of the functions require the dongle
Calling it OSX compatible is misleading since they don't give you any instructions to connect it on OSX and, if the tech support guy is right, it won't work at all on older Macs with BT 3.0- which part of what makes Bluetooth a useful technology is that it's backwards compatible.

I'll say it again: Junk.

*Original Review*
There are no instructions to pair the mouse to OSX- it just says in the booklet ""consult the manual for your equipment manufacturer. Following the directions for Windows 8 on the Windows 8 partition of my Mac I discovered that the thing won't enter pairing mode. It says to hold down the wing button and precision mode button for 5 secconds until the blue LED quits flashing for 3 seconds. That never happens and both OS's fail to connect to it without entering pairing mode. I'm not about to use a dongle- that's why I spent 60 freaking dollars on a bluetooth mouse- to free up a USB port and keep from having to worry about losing the stupid dongle. So far it's the only Bluetooth device I've ever used that has required tech support to get the thing paired and connected and as such it gets a big fat F. We'll see if tech support gets it resolved but based on the other reviews I'm not holding out much hope. And also I'm packing it back up to go back to where it came from because I found a different mouse that works fine, so Mad Katz tech support has a limited amount of time.

I would potentially rate the game if I could play it. Since I purchased it used, it was already activated to a Steam account. The Steam account is required to install the game. I tried to get Steam to transfer the CD Key to my already present account but was told no. Here is Steam's lame response:

You can spend all day going through their agreements but nowhere does it say that the game is a rental and all your rights are null and void even if you have the game CD (not burned or duplicated), game case, game manual, sales insert, jewel case cover and invoice for sale.

"I bought this controller for Killzone 2 and liked it well enough.  Coming from the ergo-awesome 360 controller, I needed something a little less wrist twisting than the DS3.  For the 10 or so hours I used the controller, it seemed quite nice.  However, something happened.

For whatever reason, my controller started vibrating without any input.  I tried to reset the controller, but it continued to vibrate.  I even let the batter completely wear down for a good week and still, when I charged it back up, it started vibrating again.

Normally, I wouldn't worry about it since this type of issue should be covered under a warranty.  However, as soon as I contacted customer service at DreamGear, I was played like a fiddle.

Not only do they not stand behind their products, but the inner-most workings of this thing must be quite sub-par for it to just start vibrating for no reason and THEN not be able to remedy it.

In summary, the controller design is nice.  However, whats the point of a controller if it doesn't work and if the manufacturer doesn't support their products.  DreamGear has failed in my eyes and I hope no one else makes the mistake of buying their less-than-worthless products.",1.0

"Have you ever wanted to become a beta tester, but pay a company instead of them paying you?  Well here is your chance!
For the incredible low price of $60, which could get you Bloodborne and Witcher 3 combined, you can stumble through a bland space adventure while finding bugs.

We have glorious A Bugs, where you fall through the map.
We have wonderful B Bugs, where characters never appear, or in some cases multiple instances of the character appear on top of each other.  In combat, enemies get stuck in midair in their T pose.  Amazing!!!
We have a never-ending cascade of C Bugs with the Team America Puppet Animation System!  (TAPAS TM)

With TAPAS TM, you can enjoy the bland story with juvenile dialogue that seems like it was translated from at least two other languages while the characters' facial animation system goes bonkers.  Feel the dramatic dialogue accompanied by facial ticks, lazy eyes, and the kind of lips you see on a rabid dog.  TAPAS TM turns every scene into an unintentional comedy worthy of Tommy Wiseau's direction of The Room.

If you're tired of wandering around maps and scanning for McGuffins, you can start writing down all of the bugs that you find.
Building on the success of Pok&eacute;mon Go, you can try to Find Them All!

"As of the time of this review, a year after release, the game runs okay for me but it requires a top end card (GTX 900 series and better) to run smoothly on high and ultra.  Normally, this is not a bad thing, but the game doesn't look like it should require as much power as it needs.  A game like Arkham City or GTA V looks as good, if not better, and runs smoothly without requiring top of the line equipment.

The questline isn't much fun either.  A lot of people don't like the game because the character you play, Aiden Pierce, is not a likeable guy.  Yes, he is a despicable character in many ways.  He treats women badly, is a jerk to his family, and often causes more problems when he tries to fix things.  I think that's fine as long as you can get into the role of a person like Aiden Pierce.  Games would be boring if we were always the hero.  I think the main problem is the various side quests and optional actions give you the choice of being the hero or the villain and if you play the hero, Aiden acts less than heroic anyway.  Usually this happens during cutscenes.

1) Minus two stars for promising and not delivering on the graphical quality Ubisoft was teasing us with prior to release
2) Minus one star for the game having terrible keyboard and mouse controls.  Imprecise and sluggish movement means controller only.
3) Minus one star for a terrible initial release that was full of bugs.  Anyone preordering was miserable.

"Before I get any hate about my opinions, which seems to be a problem when writing anything negative about this particular game.
Let's just keep in mind that this game is just... gear grinding.

Anyway, to the review.
Well, it's Smash. That's it. Basically just a slight upgrade from Brawl with some little differences here and there.
I really like that you can create a custom character from your Mii, give it different moves too. That's cool, I guess. Rather gimmicky though.
I also like the stage builder, probably my most favorite feature of this. I could spend hours doing that.
The Board game I think is just lame.
8-Player smash I think is just a mess.

So other than those gripes, here is what really grinds my gears.
Actually playing the game. All I can say is that all of the animation lags, the online lags, the input lags, just so much friggin' lag that really shouldn't even be there.
Trust me, I get it. It could be the wrong kind of TV (right). It could just be me (probably). It could be my network (probably). It could be that no one notices/cares.
I notice the lag offline, online, and even against the A.I.
But the gameplay overall is too sluggish due to this balance idea. Every character has some silly laggy action, which was the same problem with Brawl and I can't stand it. I haven't noticed this issue in melee or 64. Most of the characters are insanely fast, except for Ganondorf of course.
At first I really did love this one, up until I noticed all the silly lag that really shouldn't be there. It is just severely aggravating, to the point that it is unplayable.
I also miss the games that didn't need to be updated/patched/DLCed.
In all honesty, I'm just getting too old and impatient with these kinds of games. So if you are anything like me, take my advice and move on.

Oh well, just another game to add to the dust collection.

"The idiots at ubisoft got together one day and decided to make the worst role playing game in the history of role playing games.

What they ended up doing to accomplish this was take every negative factor from all past role playing games, and jam them all into one horrifically bad excuse for a video game.

The dialogue in this game is completely irrelevant.  There is no reason to pay attention to any of it, anything you need to know you'll figure out on your own.  There is hours of spoken dialogue in this game, none of it bears any purpose.  Characters speak, but they say absolutely nothing.  Conversations that go like ""How are you?""  ""I am ok.""  ""You look cold""  ""I am cold""  ""Thank you"".  After that waste of programming code, you're allowed to continue on.  The spoken dialogue is also done by what have to be the most unproffesional voice actors I've ever heard.  They either over emphasize the idiotic personality of the character, or don't give the character any personality at all.  You will speed click through all the dialogue in the game, that is if you end up wasting your money on this game.

The game is just one long straight line with random encounters along the way.  I spoiled the entire game for you right there.  You run forward, fight some monsters, and win the game.  That's not worth sixty dollars in my opinion.  Ubisoft deliberately released a game after putting absolutely no effort into making it interesting.  You get one town of irrelevant and annoying dialogue, where the high point is running around collecting tickets.  Final Fantasy X was just a game where you run forward throughout the whole thing, but at least they realized that they had to make their characters slightly interesting.

The battle system is slow, and makes the turn based system of battle look even more ridiculous than ever.  It's like the battle system from koudelka, you're on your own grid and use ranged attacks against your enemy who's on their own grid.  This is the most irratating system for turn based battle in my opinion.  Ubisoft will probably explain that they thought long and hard about it and decided to make a turn based battle system that let's you use strategy to defeat your enemies, they just forgot to plan the actual enemies in the game around this concept.  What I mean by that is you fight enemies who can attack every square on your grid, and you gain abilities where you can attack every square on their grid.  Chess it is not, more like turn based Rochambeau.

The menus in the game are very time consuming, and were obviously just thrown together and abandoned.  You make a weapon in one menu, quit that menu, open a different menu, equip the weapon.  You buy a skill in one menu, quit that menu, open a different menu, learn the skill, back out of that part of the menu, equip the skill.  Ubisoft apparently thinks that when you make a decision to own something, it's for the sheer joy of knowing that it's not being used as a part of your repitoire.

One are where they obviously invested (wasted) alot of effort was in making neat little companions, which they call ""golems"".  There's alot of them in this game, so you can have fun making them and looking at them.  You'll only use one at a time, so the other sixty will have to wait in limbo.  Each one is designed to be unique and speak one of two styles of japanese, slow and menacing or high and hyper.  They even wrote biographies for each golem, they explain their uniquely irrelevant details.

That is why I refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times I can install the game, let alone a DRM program (like SecuRom) that could be considered a trojen horse.

As a side note, this DRM method does nothing to stop piracy. All of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some, like spore, even before their release (with the exceptions of Sacred 2 and Red Alert 3 which have not been released yet, however the developers confirmed that they would use the SecuRom activation DRM scheme). The only thing this DRM does do is prevent this game from entering the used game market.",1.0

Things are hard to activate when clicking on them.
Things have different names other than what we in the U.S. call them.
Map is very poor.
Hint button tells you hints that you can't do because you haven't got the second or third part of the key.
JUMPS  AROUND EVERYWHERE, in and out of this world plus the mirror world!
Things make NO SENSE at times at all.
Example:: You find a hand drill. Next you have to find a ""bit"" to go with it. That's not enough, now it says you still have to find something to hold it with. So you naturally think of a case or gloves or something that holds. NOPE....what you have to find is the handle that ""Doesn't"" hold it, but rather allows you to turn the drill bit round and round in order to do it's job.
Then the drill plays almost NO ROLL in the next step or the game, as so many things are anti-climatic.
YOU find a ""CAT"" inside a locked washing machine that I have no words for the loser piece of s*** that makes that up, and now I will NEVER BUY ANOTHER GRIM TALE Game EVER!!!!!That's the End for me and you jerks have crossed the line!!
These are the things that are so frustrating that it makes me actually want my money back and wish I had never started the game.
I've played about 35 of these type of games and have learned to do well and think, and most games I don't need a guide at all but this thing is a mess I thought, and is NOT INTUITIVE. The puzzles are much too easy in most places as well. YOU JUMP AROUND MAYBE !) TIMES in this poorly designed game and never will I buy another.

The idea of the Zoom is to cover the Kinect optics with sort of a fisheye lens that allows a wider peripheral view of the scene, which in essence makes your smaller room seem bigger to the Kinect.

I can see spots on the anti-reflective coatings that causes the IR illuminator/receptor to become distorted. It would go berserk when trying to read my limb movements, or not register them at all. A large portion of the image wouldn't be seen by the Kinect due to the cheap optics.

"I guess it just gets worse and worse every year. These video game companies just cannot make a realistic, USER-CONTROLLED sports video game. It just doesn't exist. They'd rather make a game that cheats and looks stupid and unrealistic. I cannot begin to tell you how bad this game cheats...and how user-skill is completely thrown out the window....but I'll try.

The ""Legend"" skill level might be the most controlled piece of garbage I have ever played. You cannot control the accuracy of your pitches (they just move your pitch right into their hot zone)...you are not rewarded for guessing the right pitches and having perfect timing...and you constantly get screwed on phantom tags by the A.I. And one of my favorites is when you finally do make a perfect pitch, the A.I. crushes it anyway. It could be outside the strike zone all together but it will still fly out of the ballpark. Unreal.

People think this game is hard. It's not hard. It just cheats like crazy. The concept isn't hard....it's getting the game to reward you for having some skill that makes it difficult. It just doesn't. Why even give a person the controller? You cannot do a thing unless the A.I. lets you. Seems like everytime runners are on, the A.I. gets you to ground into a DP. I get a pitch up in the zone, press up on the right stick to force a fly ball....and yep, you guessed it, it STILL is a ground ball double play. NO USER SKILL. And the timing thing is a joke. I've had perfect timing and it still a weakly hit ball. NO USER SKILL.

I guess that's the way it is now. No matter how well you think you're playing, you'll still lose. I've been up 4 or 5 runs and the very next inning, I cannot locate a pitch, I cannot get the A.I. out and every hit of theirs is either in the gap or over the wall. Complete A.I. control. EA, 2K and now Sony....all run the same program. Cheat and control. Forget making it REALISTICALLY more difficult. Let's just glitch and control the game. It's the lazy way to make a sports game.

"There is a war going on ...and I'm not talking about the ongoing Iraq struggle. The battle I'm talking about is a lot more fun to discuss and a whole lot easier to understand. I'm of course referring to the ""War Of The Handhelds"".

If you've been paying attention (which I'm sure you have because you're reading a Nintendo DS review) then you will understand that Sony and Nintendo have been at combat for quite a while. Four years into the seventh generation of video game consoles consumers are now forced to pick between two dominant choices of handheld gaming devices. The Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP.

Now at first glance it would appear, from a sales perspective, the Nintendo DS is the format of choice. After all, it is the top selling handheld video game system worldwide, as of March 2008 Nintendo has sold roughly 52 million units, Amazon (at the current time) has even put a limit on how many units can be sold to one household. Compared to Sony and their PSP sales this seems to be an easy decision for anyone in the market for a new portable gaming system, right?

Well...maybe not. True, the Nintendo DS has been selling very well. But lets not get confused here. Remember the band ""New Kids On The Block""? They outsold everybody for awhile there but does that mean they were a quality band? I didn't think so.

Compared to the PSP the Nintendo DS seems more like a cheap toy for children who are desperately saving their allowance every week in the hopes of one day owning a real handheld gaming unit, such as a PSP. Not that the Nintendo DS won't appeal to everyone but after taking just a quick and honest look at the two systems it would be hard to understand why someone would purposely pass up a quality handheld like the PSP and settle for something less.

We'll start with the screen. Now this is were a lot of consumers think the Nintendo DS shines over the Sony PSP because of its dual screens and ""touch screen ability"". The truth is...it doesn't. After using the touch screen on the Nintendo DS it feels more like a unnecessary novelty than a real convenient feature. It doesn't really subtract from the unit itself but bells and whistles aren't going to score you any real points in the world of series gamers. The Nintendo DS comes with two 3-inch screens and a 256 x 192 pixel resolution which again, doesn't say much. Compared to the PSP's beautiful 4.3 inch widescreen display and 480 x 272 pixel count there is really no contest between the two. The PSP is the clear and obvious winner here.

While we're on the subject of system hardware it should be noted that several people have had major problems with the hinge on the Nintendo DS. It seems after just some moderate use the joint becomes weak and breaks, rendering the top screen of the Nintendo DS inoperable, resulting in a blank white screen. I guess adding moving parts to a handheld unit is proving as questionable as it sounds. Also, and again compared to the PSP, the general feel of the DS feels cheaply thrown together. Some reviewers have commented the PSP feels and looks a lot more expensive than it is, with comments from engadget reviewers like:

""...We're sure Sony is losing a few hundred bucks off each unit sold as the PSP easily feels like it's worth $400 of gadgetry, when compared to portable video and audio players and the DS""

Graphics is another subject worth tackling here. Even the most diehard Nintendo DS fans have nothing to say when asked between the graphics on a DS compared to a PSP. If you're looking to play sports, action, or combat games (in other words anything meaningful) then you'll be sorry you own a DS. The PSP delivers stunning graphics, comparable to PS2 style gameplay. The DS, on the other hand, very dull.

One of Nintendo's biggest problems is not with the unit itself but what is played on it. It seems like kiddie games are the games of choice for the Nintendo DS. Now, it is true the DS can play some more teen-oriented games but these a few and far between.. For the most part Nintendo seems to think that a seemingly endless supply of Mario-related games will keep DS owners occupied, and for the most part...they're right. The children who play the DS seem to enjoy these games, but if you ever get tired of Mario Kart (and you will...faster than you think) and want to play some real games like Grand Theft Auto you'll need to upgrade to a more advanced handheld, for example (you know where this is going) the PSP.

The lack of a web browser (without starting in with the add-ons) is also a problem for the DS. Also no music of video storage makes the DS a simple gaming device that lacks anything innovative and this stage in the electronic world it is almost standard to have some multimedia capabilities. The PSP again succeeds were the DS fails.

At a time of war the battlefield is no place for children and their toys. Although the Nintendo DS appeals to the kiddies it will never be taken seriously by real gamers. Its lack of multimedia features condemn it to a simple, uninspiring, cheaply made children's gaming unit with dull graphics. It may continue to outsell the PSP because of its cheap price tag...but in the end you get what you pay for.",1.0
"What made the original Fallout so good?

It was the non-linear gameplay, the tactical turn-based combat, the game setting, and of course, Macgyver.

I loved the original Fallout. I bought that game the day it came out and I played the Hell out of it. Does Fallout 3 live up to the Fallout name? Does an original fan think it's a worthy addition? Read on to find out.

There was only one thing the first Fallout set out to do. Fallout wanted to be the role playing game that let you do what you want, let you go where you want, let you kill who you want. Role playing games before this never had this sense about them, all their stories were linear and were already set for you. There wouldn't be all these role playing games today that gave you choices if it wasn't for Fallout. It was the first game to put it into the mainstream.

Fallout 3 does a good job of letting you do what you want. You are allowed to be good or evil, killing the dog or saving the dog(remember that, original Fallout fans?). However, the dialogues in the game are unintelligent and leave you wondering if they tried hard to copy the first game's conversations, or if they just grabbed a student from the local college to do them. Either way, they did a bad job with dialogues. When you role play in a game and you get dialogue options, effort should be done so the options vary in being evil or good, so you don't sound like the opposite of what you are, and most importantly, so you don't sound like an idiot. Speaking of which, the dialogues in the original Fallout actually had idiot dialogue options, in Fallout 3, every option is an idiot option, even if your intelligence is set at 10. Dialogue is dumbed down.

The tactical combat from the first Fallout was almost perfect. What Fallout 3 does, is not improve on the tactical side of combat, it ruins combat instead. They changed turn-based combat into a real-time click-affair. All you do in combat is click the left mouse button as fast as you can to shoot your weapons at the enemies. In combat, you also get to use VATS, which lets you pause in real-time to choose specific body parts to target. But it's totally pointless. There is no reason to use VATS, as it offers nothing, nothing tactical, nothing. I have played 30 hours into the game so far(on hard setting), and I have yet to use VATS once. If you want to cheat, use VATS, because all VATS does is let you cheat. Fallout fans want to be challenged with tactical combat, not play a casual combat clickfest. Combat is dumbed down.

They did manage to get the atmosphere down to a point. It's really not hard to make something look apocalyptical, but to make it look right is harder to achieve. One thing in the game that you'll notice, is that they use lots of gore. Fallout was never about gore, but seems the makers of Fallout 3 didn't get that. You find loads of chopped up bodies all over the place, as if the level designers thought it looked cool to have rooms filled with 20 chopped up bodies all around. Gore is upped up, which means it's been dumbed down, because too much gore means you aren't trying hard enough with actual content. You go for the ""shock factor"", not the ""content factor"". The game is more like Postal 3 than it is like Fallout 3. They did get the 50's jibe down really well, and I love that part of the game. Kudos to them for keeping that part.

The story in the game as a whole isn't bad at all, I just wish it was written better. I loved discovering other real vaults in Fallout, and you get to do that in Fallout 3 as well. The main campaign is pretty short, but so was Fallout's. In Fallout you could beat the game within 20 minutes, can't do it that fast in Fallout 3, but it's still short in it's own right. There's plenty of side quests to do, just like in the original Fallout. The side quest's can be long to complete, having you run around talking to several people and going to several places before you are able to complete it, but the side quests haven't been that challenging(maybe because combat is too easy? Or is it because they have arrows that point you to where everything is?).

IN CONCLUSION:

Fallout 3 is like an open sandbox RPG. It lacks the depth of the originals and it appeals to the casual audience of today. It is not a traditional CRPG like Fallout, it is a console RPG ported to the PC. It lacks what a good port should, with bad controls and a bad interface.

The game needs patching. The game crashes constantly on me. I get a lot of slowdowns after a few moment of play, when the game starts it's perfectly smooth. The game has many software problems the developers need to fix.

Overall, the game is fun, and as an original Fallout fan, I see it as a good spin off set in the Fallout universe. I do recommend it to fans of the original, as long as they know they aren't going to experience what Fallout gave them. There's some nostalgia to be had here, with familiar characters you meet and things you hear, but it's not the CRPG you love.

One last note. They also changed the name of the guns in the game. If you needed any proof of the dumbing down of the game, even without all the other stuff, just look at the names. Dumbing down weapon's names to appeal to today's lazy casual audience? I just have to say, ""give me a break"".

There has been several Fallout clones over the years that try to copy the original, they never turned out so good, but lets hope someone does a good one someday soon.",1.0
"I've snorkled in some beautiful oceans, admittedly not as deep as this 'experience' takes you, prior to buying it I pictured clear beautiful waters with bright colors. NOT! The water is murky and too dark, some dark would be nice, not all dark.

"Agree with the reviewer. Bought this game at a discount. Played for a few hours in the bunker. Didnt get out ! Tedious. Ok in twenty plus years of playing video games I have NEVER not been able to enter a game. So I guess its NOT me but rather this pathetic game This is what happens here you have to punch guys which are poorly animated and they clobber you with clubs all the while you search for exits all of which are locked mainly. Exciting! WHAT A TRAINWRECK OF A GAME !!!!  Only reason I continued was to get out and see world. But I heard that's just more of a tedious chore so why bother. If the developers of this game think this is even remotely fun than they simply are that out of touch with the gaming masses  and not just video game lunatics with no life who can spend weeks playing this TEDIOUS GAME !

What kind of a sicko makes a game like this ?? And worse yet how can people even praise this game !! Also the game I HEARD crashes constantly !! Avoid at all costs .A colossal waste of time just to figure out the designers of this twisted logic into thining that gamers would enjoy in any way whatsoever a sickening quest to find maddening secret ways to fight off roaches and horridly animated almost pixated looking stick soldiers. All in a blurry opening bunker that takes perhaps hours to get out of.

I threw this in thrash ,didn't even bother returning. Put in borderlands 2, than played some resistance 3 mutiplay and some unchartered 3. Now those games are actually a blast and fun!! Not this horror !!!

UPDATE:  Broke out of bunker ( took out of trash for one last go around) Broke out of Bunker , real exiting ( NOT) was still a mess getting out and having  1990,s video games type conversations with everyone. How is that fun ?? Also stopping at every last locker and place to get items??? Again how is that fun?? Pathetic game ,, avoid and get something fun instead and not a chore to play as this game is!",1.0
"This game is not worth buying. I'm not even sure if this game is worth renting. If you have played GTA San Andreas it is pretty much the same thing. It's a sequel so I guess it should be. There just aren't enough new things in this game to justify purchases.

If you have never a GTA, then you should rent it and see how the gameplay is. You pretty much drive from one location to the next and complete missions...kinda of boring missions too.",1.0
"The game was fun and great - you can read many other reviews about this.

MY ISSUE: I got this game with a purchase on Newegg.  At the time, it took me 45 minutes to start the download.  They failed to optimize their website for firefox, which resulted in it crashing every time I attempted to download their client.

Eventually, it worked - and I was happy.  My problems started when my HD failed - and I upgraded to a SSD! Well, The only game I didn't have on my Primary HD that failed was Farcry 3.  So, I got my new SSD with a copy of Win 7 and tried to play with the game again - I'd only gotten a little time with my new card.

I can't play.  My serial key is ""Claimed by another account""  Ubi's support forums tell me that ""You're an idiot, log on to another account you have it with - duh""

I don't have another account.  I have this one.  I contacted customer support about getting me my game.  They banned me.

"I intially played the demo for this game on the Nintendo 3DS and stupidly assumed it would be even better on Playstation Vita. Boy, was I wrong. First up, the cutscenes are blurry. Last up, the cutscenes are blurry. What century are we living in? You could go back and watch cutscenes from NES and they are at least FOCUSED. It made me so angry that I had wasted $40 on the game and couldn't return it. There were so many other Vita games I could have gotten. I trusted the franchise, the developers, and the publisher. I wrote Traveller's Tales about the game, stating that I would never buy another Lego videogame and received no response. Also never got any response from Warner Bros. In my mind, this game is defective. The sound FX in the game are horrible as well. The ONLY good thing about the game is the music, which seems to be of the same quality as the console versions. If you want a portable version of this game, definitely go with the 3DS version. I traded the Lego Batman 2 during Gamestop's +50% trade in special and got $21 for it. Not so bad considering it's going for $30 new. Put the credit down on Rhythm Thief & The Emperor's Treasure, an excellent game, which is in so many way the polar opposite of this lame port.

I put 5 hours into the game and tried out all the different mechanics, I am sorely disappointed.

You pretty much spend the first two hours repeating the shoot from cover and move forward scenario over and over.  Then the challenge factor is increased by adding guys with shotguns that require 10 shots to the head to kill and poorly placed checkpoints.  Snipers are added to shoot at you the second you peek from cover making firefights seem to go on forever.  Overall this game gets boring very quickly to the point where you feel you should be getting paid to play it.,1.0

"I thought all the talk about game-killing lag, cartoony graphics and endless errors was probably just a bunch of geeky whiners. Then I actually loaded this piece of trash onto my computer.

That's when I found out that Blizzard had invented a brand-new feature for single-player games: massive, crippling lag. It's a surprising bonus, since you've just spent the last 30 minutes installing untold gigabytes of data onto your computer. Yet somehow, the thing needs to constantly pull data from the Internet - even though there's no one in dungeon but you.

You click, you wait, you die - often with no idea why.

But let's assume for a minute that Blizzard figures out its servers eventually and the lag returns to a semi-acceptable level where the game is playable. Then you find out about the errors. Tons of them. Errors that could have been fixed during this game's literal decade of development. Yes, you read that correctly, it took more than a decade to create this garbage. Yet you'll find constant errors that kick you out of the game, reset your character and shut off your game permanently. Yes, it sounds like it's made-up, but it's not.

For instance, I was lucky enough to encounter an error 316704 (party error) which kicked me out of the game and wouldn't allow me to return. The confusing part was, I wasn't in a party. I was playing a single-player game.

Blizzard managed to spend 11 years developing a game that doesn't run properly, and isn't very fun - even when it's not shutting itself down. The fact is, most of these problems could have easily been fixed by not requiring an Internet connection to play an offline game. But that would have been too obvious.

Better to be clever and release a game that no one can ever hope to play without losing all their progress to a random blip in cyberspace.

When Diablo 3 does run, it's mildly amusing, sort of like Torchlight except worse. So if you like that, then you'll like this in a few months when the glitches have been dealt with. But I don't have the time to waste waiting for my character to catch up to my mouse pointer so I can die by the hand of invisible monsters.

Therefore, I'll be returning this for Max Payne 3.",1.0
"i absolutely loved Diablo and Diablo 2. This game however really fell short of my expectations after playing the first two games.
Game-play is extremely repetitive and feels meaningless. I know the other games repeated themselves also but playing through them was still fun somehow it's not nearly as fun playing through this game.
Another thing that bothers me is blizzard continually comes out with new and better items to make sure they make money on their real world auction house. I cannot image how much money they make creating new items to make all of the current ones obsolete. It is as if Blizzard no longer cares about actual fun and game play they are focused on making money and that's it.
To this day the game still has an extremely unbalanced feel to it, i cannot image the difference between my Demon Hunter and Witch Doctor. Some classes are simple to play with and completely unstoppable while others are complicated and are still not a viable option.

"I have a hard time recamending this system. First off I,ve only brought about 5 games for my ps3 2 of witch I never played. between the other 3 Hevenly sword, folklore, and valkyria I dought I have 100 gaming hours on my disc drive. and its already failed. It no longer spins. I have only watched 2 blue rays and 1 dvd (twice). Thats not acceptable. thus the 1 star

  I barrly used it since I,m always on my xbox core system. first gen. release, and yes 30 plus games latter 100+ hours just on soul calibur its still woking fine.

Things i didn't like about my ps3 b4 it broke.

6 axis control

playstaion network and store. (adopted xbox first and even tho free psn cant even be compaierd to the quallity of xbox live) xbox live is definatly the better choice for social gaming.

few exlusive titles of intrest. I brought mine for FF13 and blue-ray and ended up bying FF13 for xbox after sony lost the excusive

The trophies. copies of achivments on xbox aren't as easy to view and didn't catch my intrest.

Things i did like.

The playstaion controller has a better d pad.

The blue ray was able to play a dvd that skipped on all my dvd players the day it came out of box ( the burn looked wavy think it was skipping during burn).

Exlusive games like hevenly sword almost made it worth bying.

The blue-ray ps3 at the time was cheaper then blue-ray players. but alass that is the part that failed in 100 hours.

In all its not a bad system its getting to point were its got the games. but the 40 and 60 gig modles have hardware problems.

"With Tom Clancy's name being rubber-stamped onto ever-greater numbers of games like HAWX and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, it was inevitable that someone would eventually try to make an RTS game. And since most of the people who know Tom Clancy titles mainly play on the consoles, the square peg of the RTS would have to be cut down to fit in the round hole of the consoles.

In doing so, they lost the ability to click and drag a lasso around units to order groups around, the ability to command more than a dozen units, and worst of all, the ability to move the camera around at will. In its place is a voice command system that WOULD be innovative and useful if A) it wasn't a laddered command system nightmare and B) it was trainable, so it could be taught to recognize my voice instead of confusing ""Unit 1 capture A"" for ""Unit 1 Retreat."" There is training, but it's there to teach the player to say the commands the same way every time, not to train the computer to understand us. Again, this was put in to compensate for the console's lack of mouse capability.

Aside from what I've listed so far, the game's biggest fault is the lack of strategy. The gameplay is always the same - either capturing nodes in a territory control game, or holding out against an attacking force for a certain amount of time. But between the unit's absolutely glacial movement speed, the cripplingly small amount of units and types of units you can command, their fragility, and how obvious it was that the developers really didn't care about this game, and things degenerate into a boring game of rock-paper-scissors that you always lose, because the enemy always has more units. Tank beats APC beats Gunship beats Tank. However the enemy units are always tougher, so you'd better have 2-1 odds if you want to win without heavily damaged units, and you won't have those odds. There's a system where a heavily damaged unit won't be able to move, and they have to be evacuated by helicopter or they'll die for real. It's supposed to encourage you to not throw your units away, because units that survive battles become more experienced, but it makes little difference.

The story plays out like some deranged fantasy told by someone recovering from general anesthesia and the removal of their wisdom teeth.

The game can perhaps best be summed up by a quote from the creative director, one Mr. De Plater: ""every time they cut features out, it just made the game better.""

Perhaps he's forgotten that a game needs features. Especially an RTS game. If you get this game, you either are such a fan of Tom Clancy that you'll buy whatever games bear his moniker no matter how awful they are, or you've been legitimately interested by the description I've just given.",1.0

"This is the biggest rip off I've ever seen in my life.

I buy this, and install it. While it's installing it directs me to create an online account. I create the account, validate it by clicking on the link they emailed, then wait for the install to continue. 4 hours later it crashes so I restart it. Then I log in to enter the game codes, and it says that my account has been suspended. Yep, banned and all I did was the above I never even got to play the thing.

Un-believable. I would not believe this if I hadn't seen it for myself. I can't review the game because I've never played it and will never be able to and frankly after this I don't even WANT to. What a POS. It's no wonder there are so many negative reviews of this. I've been a huge fan of their games including Skyrim but I can tell you after this I will NEVER buy anything they make again, and I'll just kiss the 38 bucks I wasted goodbye and chalk it up to a lesson learned in life.

UPDATE: Once this became free, I decided to give it another shot. All I can say is wow. I've been playing it non-stop for over a week in my spare time. The quests keep you moving non stop the environment is beautiful (though seeing blue stars in daytime is a little weird) and frankly you don't get so many jags as you do on say WOW with attitudes bombing the chat with profanity laced spam with the mentality of a 13 year old (which most of them are). The quest system is amazing - it's not all go kill 5 of this or 12 of that over and over and over like some MMOs. It's truly the most interesting quest system I've ever seen and even better in that regard than Skyrim in my opinion. That's what keeps me hooked.

This now has no monthly fee, but the game is good enough that it would be worth it if it did. Of course, being able to play it vs not being able to play it makes a huge difference. The time just slips away as you play. I just wish I could have played it sooner.

My updated rating - for a game I oculdn't play 1 star but for this game that I can play, 4.5 stars, it's good enough to be 5 if you can't pick 4.5. Best overall MMO I've played (and I've played LOTRO, WoW, and EQ2.

I'd like a little more loot variety and options too as most crates and barrels and bags have food items. There are a few quirks I'd change with the UI too nothing serious there.

"MULTIPLAYER REVIEW HERE: One word for this game: Trash.
Where to begin with my frustration in playing this game?
I'll begin by comparing it to the FAR superior Battlefield 3.

BF3 rewards teamplay MORE than any other shooter I can think of out there.
Even if all you're doing is healing players, giving ammo or spotting enemies your contribution to the team is vital to their success.
Anyone who plays in a run-and-gun fashion will almost always get punished by an coordinated team on the opposing side.
It forces people to play in a realistic fashion, sticking in groups, calling out targets and taking on obstacles like a puzzle.
Eg; a tank rolls up on a sniper and his friend who both lack explosives to take down the vehicle. The friend pulls out his smoke launcher and immediately starts laying a carpet of smoke toward a building they soon take cover in. Meanwhile a group of team-mates come in under the cover of smoke following the tank, plant C4 and detonate it. The tank operator dies miserable and alone.
  Aside from the awesome gameplay in BF3, the game mechanics (although not perfect) functioned beautifully and rewarded players that took the time to learn them and coordinated with friendlies.

When DICE developed Battlefield 4 they took the game-engine apart and put it back together in the wrong order.
The game-mechanics are buggy: Ironsights take five minutes for the textures to load, reloading times are inconsistent, hit-detection is awful (sniping a guy's head doesn't always kill...). And there are so many other bugs I could name but don't have the time to remember or mention.

As well as the bugs, DICE purposely changed the whole mechanic of the game. Some weapons have ridiculous amounts of recoil, shotguns are over-powered and can kill targets from great distances, sniper-rifles are dialed at 100 meters by default (meaning you have to aim below a target instead of above), Long-range scopes are no longer an option for assault rifles (meaning it's difficult as an assault-class to take down those pesky snipers), ladders were removed from several levels because players were complaining about the non-linear combat of Battlefield.

There's so much about this game I hate. It's not even like previous Battlefield, it's a Call of Duty wannabe.
At least Call of Duty can get their game mechanics to operate smoothly and reward a player who's familiar with older COD games.",1.0
"I got this on disc when it was on sale for around $6 or $7 with all the maps and paper guide stuff included.

The graphics for TBOGT look to be better than those for TLATD, all the better now that I'm playing it in 3D.

The missions that have fellow computer controlled gangmembers along to ""help"" you out play like they were never tested before being released.  Your supposed ""allies"" in these missions/tasks do little except run into your player or stand in front of him.  They are much more of a hindrance than a help.  I find it hard to believe that Rockstar released it as it is as it is such this part of the game is such a sorry exercise in programming, but then again you can be sure that there's a large group of highly paid managers there now that can think of nothing but stuffing money into their pockets.  There are numerous other points in both games also where you're left scratching your head wondering if or why nobody ever tested the gameplay before releasing it.  Likely not.

The overall story & missions for both pretty thin compared to the previous GTA releases.  While moving around the nicely rendered city in 3D is fun there are so many poorly designed gameplay elements that this can't get about the one star level.  The slow deterioration of the GTA game series with each new installment bodes poorly for what GTA5 will be.",1.0

"Definitely doesn't look next gen. The previous couple Battlefield games looked much better than this, and I'm coming from the point of having a pretty capable gaming rig that should make this game look great...but it just does not. The texture quality is awful, and in all honestly it looks no different than previous COD installments.

Doesn't play any different, either...there's a couple new modes like a hunger games type thing, and some improved co-op, but beyond that this franchise continues to iterate on what it's already done.

In my honest opinion, Black Ops 2 looked and played better than this supposed ""next gen"" title. In a few years, when we have seen REAL next gen capabilities, we'll look back and laugh at this joke.

Gamespot.com recently gave a very low score to Batman: Arkham Origins...claiming that the game was too iterative and didn't innovate. And yet, COD: Ghosts does exactly this (in fact, COD games in general have been like this since MW1) and the game gets an 8.0 out of 10? It's clear who butters the bread of these so called ""journalists"".

"I had heard from a friend recently about Sonic the hedgehog (Sonic 06) and how bad it was. I haven't played a Sonic game since Sonic Adventure, and I grew up with the original series on the Sega Genesis. In fact, Sonic 2 was one of the first games I owned...so I had fond memories of this series, although I had been oblivious to the development of more recent titles.

I couldn't believe that it could be THAT bad, so I ended up purchasing a copy for 5 dollars at a local swap meet to sate my curiosity. This would turn out to be the worst 5 dollars I ever spent. After playing the game for about four hours, I couldn't take any more. Rather than continue playing it, I turned to youtube to watch and see if the ending was any better...as I simply did not want to play any more of it myself.

From a gameplay perspective, Sonic team truly botched this attempt. The camera is horrible, and controlling Sonic has never felt more sickening. Sonic can no longer rev up for a speed boost, and his movements feel jittery. Because of poor control, dying is common and frustrating because of the game's absolutely absurd loading times. I would predict about 10% of this game's length could be entirely loading screens...no joke.

The presentation is equally horrid. There's a lot of bad level design here, as even the hub worlds are way too big and difficult to navigate. Sonic and his friends are all here, poorly rendered and animated. Disturbingly, Sonic team decided to place these odd, furry, mascots alongside realistic looking human beings. If that weren't bad enough, Sonic even has a ""romantic"" relationship with one of these humans. The contrast here is jarring, and somewhat disturbing.

The story is absolutely insipid and the entire thing feels like bad fan fiction. The only fortunate thing is that the ending, which I looked up online, completely retcons the entirety of the game as if Sonic team knew before the game was complete that they wanted this to be forgotten.

In summation: Obnoxious controls, extremely long load times, a poor save feature that can make you lose lots of progress, bad level design, horrible presentation, awful story, and a literally forgettable ending...

Yeah...this game is horrible. One of the worst games ever. Period. If you were a fan of Sonic in the old days, this game will only destroy your fondness for the franchise.

I've been told games like Sonic Generations are better. Stay far away from this game, though.",1.0

"Assassin's Creed 2 is a very well made game on its own and a vast improvement over AC1.  It provides a semi-open gaming environment with a well balanced mixture of exploration, combat, free running (Parkour), and a sort of pseudo-but-enjoyable stealth gameplay.

To begin with, like its predecessor, the game does have beautiful graphics and well designed levels that let Gamers experience the Italian Renaissance in some famous the city-states such as Florence, Tuscany, and Venice.  Indeed, the level designs, although some what idealized, seem very authentic when compared against some of the pictures of the actual locales.  On the other hand, character design is a mixed bag.  The men generally look good, but not the women (what's up with that ?)

Furthermore, although I am not qualified to comment on the degree of authenticity of the architecture and the attires of the period -  they sure look authentic to me - I can truly say that weapon designs are authentic (except for the pistol and the hidden blades which I don't know enough to comment on).  Edged weapon collectors and enthusiasts like myself will instantly recognize some designs unique to this approximate time period such as the Cinquedea (a dagger with very wide fuller) or the Schiavona (the Italian version of the Scottish Basket Hilt Claymore).  As a side note for the collectors out there, almost all of the weapons featured in the game can be found on The Museum Replica Limited catalog (I think this is actual source material for the dev team).  Bravo to the dev team for the extraordinary level of dedication to authenticity in weapon design.

As for the gameplay, the constant reminder of the stupid `animus machine' that does not really achieve anything besides breaking the immersion of the game in AC1 is mostly gone.  Although it is still there in AC2, you hardly interact with it anymore.  This is bar none the biggest improvement over AC1 IMO since the rude interruption of immersion is what really prevented me from finishing AC1.

Talking about immersion, the game also does a very good job of that.  Along with richly detailed level designs mentioned earlier, each city-state has its own distinctive atmosphere, and the in-game background music - usually with a dab of Gregorian chants - is also a nice touch that adds to the overall experience.

Combat wise, it is nice to be wielding authentic weapons in a series of nicely animated moves.  However, in spite of the numerous moves, the combat elements is not all that deep; you only need to remember about 3 crucial moves (`disarm' and `counter-kill' is the best).  Free running is fun but can be very challenging on the side quests.  The story is decent enough to keep you interested, but the mingling of fact and fiction is what make it really interesting to me.

In addition to some console features (such as having to approach the spot on the ground with the `twirly light' to advance the story) that slightly detract from the immersion factor, and the `Da Vinci' code wannabe decoding sequences, Stealth elements are incomplete - if not weak.  Evidently, this assassins does not possess true stealth of cover and concealment (remember the classic ""Thief"" series ?); his only meant of avoidance of detection is really speed and agility.  However, even when the gameplay seems to be absurd, it still somehow manages to be fun.  For example, being the only guy wearing a hood and standing in the middle of four prostitutes who are flaunting their `wares' ... is NOT blending into the crowd; but as you can see, this could be fun... I ought to try it sometimes.

Also, in AC2, you have a villa and a walled town to call your own that you can maintain and improve (almost like the D'Arnise Keep style from Baldur's Gate 2) that, when properly renovated, will provides more cash income than you know what to do with.  You can also put on your own nifty touch by collecting famous paintings (but not sculptures) to decorate and add values to your family property.  Again, a very nice touch.

In short, AC2 is a very good game that teeters on the border of being an exceptionally great game.  And although I wish to go back to the Holy Land and the Middle East again in AC2, I must admit that cantering around the rolling hills of Tuscany on horseback never really get old.  Regrettably, the happiness must end for the PC version of the game -- Even this deadly assassin is crippled by abusive DRM.

Even though it is never explicitly stated, the primary purpose of DRM - especially the excessive and overbearing type of DRM, such as limited online activation, or in this case, online activation AND permanent internet connection -  is to *TIE ONE USER TO ONE LICENSE* by eliminating the sales of the actual product (since the actual product is protected by the First Sale Doctrine), and forcing the sale of a license only -- Everything else is secondary - piracy is just a convenient pretext to achieve this purpose.

Evidently, Ubisoft is willing to go to any length to achieve this purpose - including deliberately insulting its Customers and their intelligence - with this type of extreme DRM.  It is rare when industry insiders and DRM/corporate sympathizers are openly speaking out against their own, but Ubisoft has really crossed the line this time. As is, my message to Ubisoft will be curt:  Revert to a more reasonable DRM that Customers can compromise with  - such as a disc check, or GET OUT of the PC Gaming sector for good.  You will NOT be missed.

A message to my fellow Customers: However you choose to speak out against Ubisoft and this type of extreme DRM, please refrain from pirating this game.  It may seems like a good way to piss down Ubisoft's throat for now, but in the long run, it is not worth compromising our integrity as legitimate Customers for; no game - no matter how good - is worth this.

If you must play this game - a good game from an excellent dev team misrepresented by the Ubisoft suits  - consider renting the console version, or buying the game *used* for the consoles so that the greedy publisher will see as little of your money as possible.  I was waiting for the PC version  - since AC1 PC version is superior - but I am somewhat glad that I bought  a used copy for the Xbox360  when the price drop to $26.  Had I known about the travesty of PC version, I would have waited even longer to buy a used copy for even cheaper.

"I cannot believe how there are people who would give this terrible product 5 or even 4 stars. This is a substandard game in almost all respects.

MOST IMPORTANT! This game requires you to have your Xbox360 plugged in the internet and that you have a Gold Membership at Xbox Live! If you do not do so, you CANNOT save your progress! I played for several hours when I discovered that. A total waste of time. There is a warning when the game starts but I thought they meant XLive achievements, which I don't care about. There is NO warning on the box when you purchase it!!

The above is completely unacceptable. Maybe the company had some misguided thoughts about using this as a protection against pirating. It is inexcusable nonetheless, especially since there is no warning on the box. Boycott such practices! I am returning my copy to BestBuy shortly.

In and of itself the above should condemn this product, but for those who do not mind the above outrage, I continue with pros and cons.

Pros:
- some parts of the graphics are stylishly done
- controls are easy to use and intuitive

Cons:
- Overall camera is annoying and poorly done. Zooming and moving are difficult to separate in the heat of battle. You cannot see much in the distance because the angle is too steep. The camera is a constant annoyance.

- a lot of the graphics is very angular. I have an excellent 1080p TV and so I can see how bad it is.

- there is no pause. The phone rings? You need a bathroom break or a glass of water? Tough. You will be attacked and killed while away. Settlements are few and far between, so you cannot simply run for cover. Neither can you teleport (see below).

- no teleport over large areas. I spent a lot of time tracking over known terrain to go back and get rewards for finished quests. This is just stupid. All good games in the genre starting from Diablo and ending in Titan Quest have a decent system of fast transport. It is ridiculous that a new game would not have such a feature.

- no map! How are we going to get anywhere reliably without a simple map, let alone a teleport system?? Ridiculous!

- inventory is poorly and primitively done. At least items are grouped by general type. But, there is no good system of item comparison. I wasted a lot of time trying to compare new and old items. Maybe the developers should look at Oblivion for a clue.

- there is a jumble of skills, spells, abilities, relics, etc. Most don't make much sense and it is difficult to glean how they work together. You find skills in items! How does that make any sense? I found a pile of skills that I cannot use because they are not allowed to my character class. Stupid. On top, each ability can be further modified by its own enhancements and by other skills that enhance them. So, the character sheet is a complete and utter mess! Finally, there is no way to see important detail about the skill and ability stats and mechanics until you actually purchase them. And, you cannot return them.

- items have levels that make no sense. Sometimes level 1 items are better than level 2 items or about the same. What is the point of the level then?

I give it 2 stars for fun, because it does have potential but the extremely poorly thought-out features make it a total drag. One star is about right for overall score.

To those that gave 4 and 5 stars, here is my advice - check out Oblivion, Fallout 3, Titan Quest. Those are well made, well thought-out games. This one is garbage by comparison.",1.0
"I was a fool.

It's not always easy to admit, but in this case, I do so freely.  I prepaid for this ripoff, blissfully assuming that it would be worth the money.  It is not.  Yes, it is an enjoyable game, eventually, but not worth the price in truth.  It simply doesn't hold the power of the first to captivate and ensnare.  The theme is no longer original, and the story is a stretch.  Combat is passable, and bugs there are aplenty.  That of course is not the worst of it though.

When will these idiots realize that DRM does exactly nothing to stop piracy?  It was available on BitTorrent THE SAME DAY IT HIT THE SHELVES.  Nice job with that copy protection guys.  Wonder how much you paid for it.  Sure didn't stop the pirates.  What it DID do was irritate the hell out of anyone (like me) dumb enough to actually pay for your game.  The pay version is inferior to the pirated version.  Take 2 paid who-knows-how-much money for DRM that encourages people to pirate the game, because the pirated version doesn't have limited installs.  It doesn't require an Internet connection to play.  It isn't saddled with the horrific SuckyouROM.  And of course it's free.

As a contrast, consider Mass Effect 2.  Apparently, Bioware learned the lesson that Take 2 is obviously having trouble with.  Ironically, I obtained that game in an ""unorthodox"" fashion, assuming that it, like its predecessor, would be laden with DRM.  I was wrong.  Upon learning of this, I actually went to Gamestop and purchased a copy that still sits unopened on my desk.  That's right.  True story.  I paid for it, because it is a fine game with only the bare minimum DRM that requires a CD.  I find this reasonable, if slightly annoying.  Bioware deserved my business for their decision to not punish honest buyers.

Take 2 does not.

It will be interesting to see which game actually makes more money.  I'm going to say it's a safe bet that ME2 will.

"I don't know what is going on.  I wrote a review for this game yesterday and checked to see if it was up today and there are now zero reviews!  There were about 2 dozen 1-star reviews and a smattering of 4-5 star reviews from ppl who hadn't played the game yet but were sure it would rock.  Amazon are you caving to vendors now?
Anyway, here is my review...again.
This game is a complete ripoff.  LOTR2 is one of my favorite games of all time; if it ran on win2k I'd still play it (tip: it runs on XP in compatibility mode).  LOTR3 is nothing like it.  In fact they seemed to take everything good about LOTR2 out and replace it with ... nothing.  Specifics:
1) Terrible documentation!!!  The booklet that came with the game is completely insufficient and online/on cd docs are almost identical to the printed one.  This is a recurring theme in my review.  You are basically sitting there looking at stuff you can't click on wondering what to do.
2) All micro-management of resources is gone.  You assign a peasant to a parcel of land and then ignore it completely as he makes food automatically.  Same goes for soldiers and money.  No ability to change what type of soldiers or food.  Or maybe there is but there is NO DOCUMENTATION!!!
3) You can't conquer pieces or territory anymore.  You can only devastate them and you have to take out the main castle and then you get all of the territories at once.  This took a large part of the strategy out of the game.
4) Hiring mercs is a gamble because you only see their title like ""siege engineer"" and a tiny piece of info, which didn't include the cost of hiring them.  Maybe there is a way to find this info, but there is NO DOCUMENTATION!!!
5) You can't upgrade the castles except in your main province.  Read that line again.  They took out one of the most fun aspects.
6) Upgrading your main castle is a crap shoot since you have the option to downgrade, but still pay money to do so.  So you have a level 5 castle and can buy and build a level 2 castle thinking you are getting an upgrade.  The in-game descriptions of the castles consist of the castle name (ie ""strong stone castle"") and a really small picture - nothing else.  NO DOCUMENTATION!!!
7) You upgrade castles by saving money and buying the upgrade.  After about 30 real-world minutes of saving someone steals my money every time.  I have no idea how or how to stop them because there is ... (boy I'm getting tired of typing this) NO DOCUMENTATION.
8) During battle scenes you can't zoom in or out which makes it difficult to manuever your forces or even tell what troop types you are facing.  The graphics are not that good despite being *very* hardware intensive (more on that coming up).
9) The graphics are *very* hardware intensive (told ya ;-)).  ""Recommended"" specs are 1.5GHz, 256RAM and if you use ATI, a Radeon 8500 or later.  I have a 2200+ CPU (clock speed ~1800MHz), 512MB DDR 400 RAM, and a Radeon 9700 Pro.  During sieges I got to watch arrows fly at my troops *frame-by-frame*.  That was with 2 enemy units vs 3-5 of mine, not a massive battle at all.
10) After allying myself with another county I accidentally clicked on that county while controlling my army.  I was automatically at war despite being 2 counties away and immediately clicking somewhere else.  Lame.
11) Sieges.  The crowning achievement of LOTR2.  They suck in LOTR3.  Instead of attacking the front of a castle where the defenders are massed, I went around the side.  The defenders didn't reposition themselves.  So I climb the walls, get all my guys on top of the wall and they ... mill around randomly.  They almost completely ignore my commands, and the worst part... I CAN'T TARGET THE DEFENDERS!  So I sit there gaping while 2-3 archers (not 2-3 units of archers) mow down my 3 units who are standing right next to them.  I repeated this experiment several times with same results.
12) Attacking an army on the field is lame.  If you set up two units to attack one unit from different angles, both your units just bee-line right for the center of the enemy unit anyway.  Not anything like the cool tricks you could play with the Total War series.  No usage of terrain or weather or anything.
Summary: This game is actually *less advanced* than LOTR2 in a lot of ways.  The only advancement I saw was in graphics, which were sub-standard anyway.  If you cherish LOTR2 like I do, AVOID THIS GAME!

its chain seems to have no limit in range which is ridiculous.  doesn't matter how far you run away the chain teleports you to him and stuns you.... so you are dead.

"This game is completely terrible. There are no redeeming qualities to it. Two Worlds 2, the sequel to Two Worlds (or is it One World 2) is one of the worst games to grace this generation of gaming.

To start, Two Worlds (1) was a terrible game to begin with and an even worse port to the Xbox. It's surprising that they even got enough money to make the sequel. If you want a better gaming experience than Two Worlds 2 however, play Two Worlds online with a friend because that's all there is.

Two Worlds 2 did so many things wrong. From a bad story to a terrible questing system, Two Worlds looks shiny and new, but you can't cover up the horrible failure that it is.

You may think I'm being hard on this game, but trust me, I played through the entire thing. It tested my patience, and my sanity.",1.0
"The first Tomb Raider was what got me interested in the Playstation console.  Over the years they've gotten progressively better.  Then there was a long lapse between the 4th installment and now.  What in the world happened!??!

This title is utterly useless.  The controls are terrible.  The camera angle is annoying and the levels are very uninspiring.  Then you have this interaction with other humans that is just useless.  You choose certain sentences and that is supposed to alter the game somewhat.  All it does is use up precious game space on the disc.  Utterly useless!!!

The music, is beautiful.  But these games are known for their music.  The graphics are nice, when you can see them.  The game is way too dark.  I know it supposed to be dark as you are in a tomb, or cavern, but it doesn't have to be that dark to where you can't see certain objects or other nuances.

I also judge a game on how I can just sit and play without reading. In this instance, I had to consult the manual because the controls weren't intuitive.  Like the auto-aim and manual aim.  Some of the ""bosses"" were so lame.  At first you think it's going to be a challenge.  But, you try and try and try, and you can't beat it.  Then you do the unthinkable.  You consult the web for a walkthrough and when you read it, it's like, ""How dumb is that!!"".  After performing the moves to kill the creature, it was really quick and not very satisifying.

They include this lame ""Making of"" which is supposed to be insight on how the game was designed and what it took.  All it did was waste space on the DVD.  Who cares how you made the game.  It didn't give any special insight into the way it was created because the game itself is terrible!!

Overall this game left a very bad taste in my mouth.  One that I hope will not resurface in the next installment.

"This is a four-pack of 'Hidden Object (H.O.)' games. I have played good and bad H.O. games, but this is by far the worst. Not only are the ""storylines"" useless, but they actually become annoying. Worse yet, some of the objects are near-impossible to find. I know the point of an H.O. game is to seek out hidden objects, but some fairness should be observed in their designs. For example, in one game I had to use the Hint, which encircled a location on the screen for a Skateboard...IF there was a skateboard there, it was beneath a Tuna! I clicked all over the area to no avail.
  Friendly advise: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SET!

My sugestion is to try another series. Viva Media usually puts out decent H.O. games, but this set was certainly not a credit to them. I recommned 'House of a Thousand Doors' series, also by Viva Media. These are puzzle/problem solving games that also include Hidden Object searches for specific tools to use throughout the games adventure/quest.",1.0
"Man was I looking forward to Battlefield 4. The hype was huge.

Though DICE has fixed many issues in this game already, it is still riddled with endless annoyances.

I've put in over 100 hours into BF4 hoping it would get better the longer you play it, but it really doesn't.

80% of the time this game is not fun at all.

Things that piss me off:

1. Lag on Conquest Large
2. 3rd person vehicle physics
3. Not all shots do damage (net code related)
4. Shot behind cover (net code related)
5. New item notifications in the menus are broken (notifies of items previously unlocked (orange triangle))
6. Characters awkwardly vibrate when you walk/run into/near a teammate
7. Insertion into game at very end of round
8. Unbalanced servers
9. Spawning (is it too hard for DICE to make a smart spawn system with one simple algorithm: don't spawn in an enemies view or vicinity)
10. Battle pickups broken (how long do you have to hold triangle to pick up these weapons? It's about 2.22399790620 seconds, because if you're off, it'll throw the weapon back down, and 95% of the time this is what happens )
etc
etc
etc

This game doesn't feel fair, and is rarely fun.

Take Battlefield 3, add a bunch of bugs but hide it under new weapons, maps, gadgets, vehicles so hopefully we won't notice the bugs... then you have BF4.

Don't even get me started on the horrible campaign.

I would love to say that I'm going back to Battlefield 3, but I've put in over 400 hours into that game and am done with it. I could try even Bad Company 2, which is my favorite. But the servers are quite empty and the thrill of that great game has worn off when BF3 came out.

I hope to god the next BF game will be amazing and not another crap fest.

I'll play the new DLC's coming out for BF4 because I've already paid for it all, but the fun is just not there. This game is a broken, annoying mess that just gets me pissed off every time I play it. And boy have I tried soooo hard to like it.

I spent the first 16 hours troubleshooting with EA to get this game to stop crashing during cinematic.

"While parts of ""Wolverine"" are really fun, there are parts that are so painful, you'll probably just give up on the game (as I did). I'm not talking about the boss battles that are identical to each other (which are fairly boring), I'm talking about the lame, typical ""jump at just the right time"" puzzles that pop up throughout the game and really slow down the fun. Seriously, this game came out in 2009 and they're STILL including lame jumping puzzles? Is this 1998 again? The combat in the game is fantastic, but it's like the programmers ran out of ideas and decided to just stick in a ton of lame obstacles, rather than try and come up with anything that rivals the combat. The puzzles are not only lame cliches, they're so impossible that they make the game somewhat unplayable. It stops being fun and starts being painful. Why should I waste my time on a game that's so frustrating? There are many many other games out there, games that try harder to be innovative and do more than just throw up obstacles in the gameplay. This is 2 dimensional thinking, with zero ingenuity or insight. The result is a tired, boring, frustrating game with occasional moments of fun- but not enough to warrant your money or time. Avoid this one, spend the money on something better.",1.0

"I've played just about every game in the Tom Clancy Series on playstation, PC and now X-Box. Therefore, its obviously an understatement to say I've always been pleased with the games.

This however is a disaster.

Simply put its quite possibly the most over-rated game I've ever played.

Sound is excellent, graphics good, but game play horrible. Previous games in this series have focused on realism, strategy and skill. This one doesn't live up to its predecessors.

As this title has been highly touted for ""the next generation console"" X-Box 360 I guess I would expect more and something closer to realism. To give an example: After completing the training and your opening mission you are instructed to fly into Mexico to search for the missing President of the United States who was on a visit to Mexico. You are positioned in an open door of a helicopter with a heavy machine gun and under attack from various Mexican rebels shooting mostly with rifles. These rebels while taking heavy fire from your weapon barely seek cover, rarely react to this barrage and at times are hit squarely by your fire and don't respond. Hardly next genereation AI. The helicopter apparently is not equipped with any other weaponry, you have no ""teamates"" supporting you so it merely is a shootout. Its tedious and does nothing to mimick reality. After all you are part of a special forces group attempting to rescue the President and all you have is one helicopter circling an area with a machine gun?

Your ""teamates"" are useless. Besides running into your field of fire during firefights, they do NOTHING. If you direct them to an area they'll follow your orders and then fight...while standing up in the open taking fire. No attempt to take cover, no rhyme or reason to providing suppressive fire. They literally just stand there and fire until they're hit and you have to attempt to rescue them.

No strategy, no realism. I could cite further examples but you get the picture.

Do yourself  a favor. Save your money and wait for a real game like Call of Duty 3.",1.0
"When I first got it, I was excited and ready to play N64 with my brother. However I did realize the product I recieved was different than the one in the picture. I really didn't care as well as it didn't say ""Nintendo"" in the front part of the control. However once I plugged the control and tried to play Super Smash Bros., in the menu where one has the move the analog stick to choose what to play or edit game settings, it was going beserk. I thought it may have been my old original purple control, I unplugged it, but it wasn't the case. Then I connected the new control, tried it in all four connections, and the same thing happened and it turned out that there was something wrong with the new control and returned it. I got myself a used ORIGINAL grey ""Nintendo"" N64 control from another seller which costs a couple of more bucks but it sure is worth it.

"I know what you'e thinkin'!!  I love Street Fighter 2, especially the Champion Edition because it super cool, fun, and has the outstanding graphics for its time, great selectable characters, and fluent controls.  Thats good and all for Super NES releases, but what was Sega thinking when releasing this game on the Genesis?  Read carefully because there are two major things I find wrong with the release on this console.

1. The buttons are limited.  I know that the Genesis has three main buttons other than start, but a standard fighting game has six buttons (HK, MK, LK, HP, MP, LP), not three!!  I don't know if this game is programmed for Genesis' new six button controller, but in order to use punch and kick buttons, you have to switch it up by pressing start, but that sucks the fun out of the game when you are trying to use a combination of moves to make it possible to defeat your opponent.
2. THERE'S NO PAUSE BUTTON!!!  In order to make a button to switch up from punches to kicks and vice versa, they made it for the start button!!
Theres absolutely no excuse for a 16-bit game to not have a pause button!
If you dare to play this game on the Genesis, make sure you have no interruptions: go to the bathroom before playing, make sure your parents don't need anything for two hours, and leave a message on your answering machine that says ""I'm playing Street Fighter 2 on the Genesis that has no pause button, leave a message after the beep.  BEEP!""

"Well, this game did improve a couple things from the first game. Such as the smoke bombs, double hidden blades, and the ability to hire groups to assist you. Other than that, the game is crap. They added a lot more stuff to this game, but none of which is useful or even fun. A lot of missions you do will pretty much require you do it only one way. There are horse race missions...unfortunately the horse controls are still just as clunky as the first one. You will repeatedly jump onto guards when you're just trying to get off a building (real helpful feature *sarcasm*). You get your own town that you can upgrade to get more money...but the only thing you spend money on in the game is weapons, in which, if you never spend money to upgrade your town, you'll have all the money you need to get the weapons you want. Some of those stupid puzzles you do are broken, such as trying to turn the rings to form a picture...but no matter what you do, some rings will turn together and never allow you to complete the picture. I hate the characters. You can literally assassinate 5 guys in a row before you start combat with whoever is left. The maps are busy, so it's hard to tell what's where.
This game also introduced the ability to blend in with crowds to stay hidden from guards. Unfortunately, this feature is broken, and I couldn't even do the introduction mission using that ability. You're suppose to follow the head prostitute around the block by blending in with the crowd and be undetected by the numerous guards. But every single time I tried, the crowd would ALWAYS stray away from her, in which I would either fail by being lead too far away, or I would try to make my way back to her and be caught by a guard. The only way I found to do this mission was to stay close to her while using the rooftops. Really, I tried again and again to do this mission the way they wanted me to, but apparently it is just based off of sheer luck if any crowds manage to go the same direction as her throughout the mission.
I'm sure I missed some stuff, but that's enough of the complaints. The first game concentrated on its strong suits and made you play minimally on its bad parts. Assassin's Creed II does just the opposite. I tried and tried, but the boredom and frustration from this game prevented me from finishing it.

"Are you hoping for a current generation system version of POP Sands of Time? Or maybe Assassin's Creed with different graphics? Or something resembling the last gen POP sequels? If you're hoping for any of these (like I was), you will be shockingly disappointed by this game. At first you won't want to admit it (because you just dropped sixty bucks on a game with some history in the name) but eventually you'll accept it and will be able to admit that this game will be in the bargain bin in about 2 months.

When POP Sands of Time came out for PS2 I was instantly hooked. I was so enthralled by that game. The maneuvering, the visuals, the imagination, etc. Fast forward several years and then Assassins Creed came out. POP SOT was the first game I thought of. AC was like SOT but oodles better. Then I heard a new POP game was coming out.

I remember being leary about this title because of the cell shading. The ""cell-shaded"" graphics (as they're apparently called) is really just a cheap way to opt out of having to develop lifelike graphics. The character graphics look very last gen. The environment graphics don't look much better. It's like you're playing a comic book.

But, I'm always willing to forgive lackluster visuals if the game has good gameplay. I am not exaggerating when I say that 98% of this game is nothing more than running around and exploring. No fighting, few puzzles, and no risk of dying or restarting at a checkpoint. It is literally impossible to die in this game. The gameplay is basically run, jump, climb, and then repeat. I don't understand what Ubi was thinking with this game. There is almost no point to this game. For every hour of gameplay, you might encounter one or two enemies. That's it. Seriously.

My advice: fight the urge to buy this. Hit a few local rental stores and try it out first. Considering the namesake behind this game, I just can't believe how incredibly pointless this game is.

Oh well, I'm just going to hope Ubi doesn't completely botch the Assassins Creed sequel they're working on. Please Ubi, don't botch it!",1.0

It's a disaster of a game, and a failure as a piece of software, and should be avoided at all costs.",1.0

This software with all its copyright protections and working with Steam and the internet was a nightmare. It rendered the software unusable for me.

"I beat the first one (and its expansions) a few times because I love it so much. I consider myself a ""Tycoon Pro"" with all the games. This is the worst simulation game I HAVE EVER PLAYED.

I beat it. Unlocked everything. There aren't many animals or unlockables even with the expansions, it's really pathetic.

Maintanance workers are pointless, literally. There area no tour guides in this one; there's anal-retentive ""Educators"" that despite taking up little space visually, they demand a large area around them. Zookeeper AI would be laughable if it wasn't so aggravating. They stand around. You will have to go ""guest mode"" to clean all the poo up & replenish food/water because they don't do it.

You get in-game alerts (an intended cruel joke courtesy of the game creators) for various things the game deems important. OH MY GOD. IT DOESN'T EVER STOP. Most of the alerts will SPAM RAPIDLY that zookeeper so-and-so can't reach the poo or food dish despite it being easily accessible.

You will be broke the entire campaign mode. Most of your ""gameplay"" will be spent WAITING for cash so you can build things (but by then it will cost you 10x more to advance since its programmed to go apocalyptic if you don't build something every 10 minutes.)

There are no cheats for this game. No special creatures like Unicorns or Bigfoot. No neat eastereggs like putting a mermaid statue in a fish tank and watching it come to life.

There are only 3 restaurants in the game and they all look the same. There's only a couple of animal houses/attractions and kids playground equipment doesn't even have a swing.

The graphics are HORRID!!! The moose body frame looks like the cheetah. For 2006 there is no excuse for it. You'd think the graphics would be decent given the install requirements, but no.

One thing I thought was cool was the addition of Jeep tours... but the graphics are so bad and lunky that the experience of riding in the car is lame.

First off I'd like to say it's insane that this was going for $40 for the Wii at one point. I bought it for the Playstation Network for $10 and I'm furious I even did that considering how incredibly bad the game is. If you don't win the first price round your game ends. It loads again. SLOWLY. Then if you don't win the first price round your game ends... AGAIN! Then the game loads again.. SLOWLY. Then if you FINALLY get to actually have a little bit of gameplay you are bombarded with ads for real products due to cheesy and blatant product placement. Then if you don't win that price game your game can also be over just as quick. It seems like no matter what you do in this game your game can be over in an instant without having ever done anything even remotely fun. You guess a couple of prices then you're wrong and then you're instantly done. All in all very boring and very frustrating. I only spent 10 dollars on it and I'm still upset because the game was a total waste. Avoid at all costs!,1.0

Doom 2016 is a fast game, excellent graphics but is not a Doom game anymore. It has been toned down, not even the ""hell"" part is scary anymore.

In my humble opinion, this is a game that has excellent graphics, fast paced, etc but is it a Doom game? to me was more like playing a dude that looks like Metroid slash Halo slash Call of Duty on space kinda thing.

"Don't believe the crap that they try to sell you here.
The reason that its getting so many stars is because they're trying to sell it back and get rid of it, and I'll tell you why.

First off, the graphics are nothing special. The camera angle is just flat out piss pore. You have to fight the camera every step of the way, throughout the game. (You'll know what I mean if you go and play it.)The options menu doesn't help ether, when you go to change the controls on your controller it just makes it harder if anything.

The level settings are also a complete failure, you'll die at least 30 times just to get to the second level, while the setting is on easy. You can take my word on that.

Throughout the game your in a constant state of fighting an uphill battle, your constantly out numbered, your usually almost dead at the end of every battle.

You will say to yourself at times; ""How can anyone play this game on a hard level and actually win?""

The level that I made it to was a boss on a horse that constantly had men showing up, is just impossible to beet. After that I just quit the game.

In a nutshell:
The the fighting engine is awful.
The camera angles are a never ending struggle.
Option menu is useless.
And the pressure just continues as you go on. The harder it gets, the less you want to play it.

Unless if you get joy out of yelling at your TV all the time. Do NOT buy or even rent this game. This game is increasingly stressful and you will find NO rest or fun in this game at all.",1.0

I tried running in Windows XP compatibility mode with service pack 2  and also service pack 3. I tried installing patches , made no difference. I tried trouble shooting compatibility mode and it suggests Windows XP Service Pack 2 .The two computers run BF3 , MW3 and other new releases with ease. Never again will I buy any  Rock star video game. I went on forums and tried everything tried and suggested. Maybe I just got unlucky. I should of listened to all the bad reviews on this PC version.

"The product as mentioned is one that I had ordered as ""used"" from, what I assume to be, a different seller. Yet the link drags me back to this playstation vita, which is literally just one hundred dollars more.
The one I had ordered stated that it includes a memory card and the charger, so I was expecting it to arrive with that in the box. It arrived a day late, and it was only the playstation vita system. There was no memory card, and there was no charger. I can live with the dents and scratches (there aren't that many, and it was used, so I was expecting that), but every time that I go to where the ""ordered"" section takes me, I arrive at this product.
Now, seeing as I have no charger and no memory card, I have yet to boot it up, therefore, I cannot write a review based on gameplay or anything else (the games I've ordered have yet to arrive anyway.)
This one is priced at (roughly, minus shipping and handling) 226 USD. Now, whether or not this comes with a memory card or charger, I'm unsure. If it doesn't, I would honestly go out into public and purchase one that actually comes with a charger, and a memory card (if memory serves, they're $199 at Gamestop, and they come with a game, I think.)

EA used to be a good compnay, I am not sure what happened to transform them into what they are now, but this makes me sick. I spent $40 on this game and it will never be played. Not once.

"For those of you expecting the same old Battlefield 2 ported to PS2 you are going to be disappointed.  The game retain almost none of its orginal featues, No longer are you trying to control a map through spawn points but rather the old ""run here shoot this"". ""Hot-Swapping"" takes you totaly out of the game by constantly switching players. Rather than dying and chosing a new unit, when the player dies (which isn't often due to tons of health,) they are given command of the nearest allied unit no matter their class.  The realism involved is taken out with these features and with virtually unlimited ammo and health the game is boring and easy.  Some gamers might find it entertaining to go around shooting things, but for true fans of Battlefield 2 this game is a sad disappointment.

Pros:
  -Pretty good graphics
  -Easy controls
  -Muliplayer can be fun (all though usually not)

Cons:
  -Really easy
  -no stategy
  -tons of health, unlimited ammo
  -boring, repitive, not he same as Battlefield (PC)

"The game's crap. Pretty much take your favorite feature of Sims (aging, families, downloading hot babes from the EA exchange, find some way to stuff seven Sims and a shrieking baby into a one-bedroom treehouse), and replace it with this mind-numbingly boring ""quest"" system, where ""quest"" means ""The Game Tells You What Selection To Click On So Nevermind This Thinking (or Creativity) Stuff and Thanks For Your Money"". You have fifty ""quest points"" to spend on quests, then you can't do anything more with your kingdom. You do ""unlock"" another kingdom, but it looks EXACTLY THE SAME and you do the SAME QUESTS all over again! I exaggerate a bit, since, in reality ALL THE QUESTS ARE THE SAME, sorta like how choosing Friendly - Chat is strikingly NOT different from Friendly - Ask About Day.

It's called a ""linear quest game"", except my dictionary doesn't define ""linear"" as ""Go click on the yellow quest bubble AGAIN and choose the blatantly mind-numblingly obvious selection AGAIN that sticks out like sore purple gangrenous thumb AGAIN"" but I guess the EA dictionary does, right next to the one that defines customer as ""SUCKER"".

You pretty much do nothing but quests, and the game's quests are a linear ""Lead-You-By-The-Nose-With-A-Meathook-Through-Said-Nose"" walkthrough consisting of more mouse clicking than creativity or thinking as the game tells you the ONLY thing you can do to go to the next ONLY thing you can do to get through the quest. Want to recruit a guard as a volunteer for the army? Well, tough! You have to get the town local drunk and have HIM volunteer. Why? Because the game told you to. That's why. End of discussion. You *can* do some Sims sandbox stuff, but it's downright limited. For example, you can buy furnishings -- not that you want to, since everything comes pre-furnished -- but can't modify the architecture. This game might as well be titled ""Generic Medieval Do-Nothing-But-Click-Where-the-Game-Tells-You-To We-Took-Your-Money-So-HA-HA-HA"" Game. Maybe there will be a good Sims standalone game, but this isn't it. EA, Just release a decent ""Medieval and Magic"" Sims expansion set, take our money, and give us something decent and fun.

So why did I buy it? Because it was 50% off. And, even then, it was a ripoff.

And, maybe, because it had SIMS on it, I was expecting a SIMS game. EA should have called it ""Sonic the Hedgehog in a Sims Skin Runs Around After the Next Gold Quest Popup Circle in a Medieval Kingdom You Play Frickin' Over and Over Again"" because that's a more accurate description. I mean, I had the game on Speed-3 all the time AND after completing one kingdom, the game starts you over in a new kingdom where you have to START BUILDING ALL OVER AGAIN.

I should mention you DON'T have the choice of ignoring the quests, unless you want the ""Not doing Quest"" moodlet, er, modifier. You don't get ""free play"" mode until you spend hours (or what stretched into what felt like hours and hours) of mindless clicking on the quests. And, of those who have played it, they found the sandbox limiting and the game boring.

I should also mention that others have bought the disk game at 50% off, which should be a big red flag, given that the game's only been out for a few weeks.",1.0

2. Give us a Rover or a space car to explore the planets. Walking sometimes is very borring, if you to farther then the spaceship is too far away.

4. We need action, ACTION. Space battles. Please more space battles, even the space are too borring.

The first chapters are great! The graphics and the parkur are all amazing! But after a feel chapters everything turn into crap! When you finish the game you just can think about how you could expend your money on this...
And those animations between the chapters? HORRIBLE!!! This is a new generation game! Not a flash game from a random website!

$100 for 32 GB is grossly overpriced.  I can understand why Sony does it....the hardware itself is sold at a loss, and they need to make that money back any way they can....but the prices for memory are currently an obscenity.  As a gamer, I can remember Sony fanboys screeching about how overpriced proprietary drives are for the Xbox 360.  I must wonder what those same fanboys are saying now.

I can get a 32 GB Micro SD card for around $30-35.  Sony is charging THREE TIMES AS MUCH for that same amount of storage.  This is simply not acceptable.  I plan on using and playing my Vita for as long as possible without buying any more storage until pricing is more reasonable....as in, say, $10 for 4 GB, $20 for 8 GB, and $49.99 for 32 GB.

"I am 15 years old. This is my first review (out of about 30) that is a 1-star review. And I have 18 (give or take a few) reasons why I hate this game so much:
1. After the first game, the questions started repeating. The game is basically the same 40 questions over and over again.
2. You can't skip the introduction. I know it's not too long, but you'd think that with today's technology there'd be an option to skip it.
3. Regis is appallingly rude. Once I won nothing and he said, ""Welll, there you go. Don't spend it all in one place. In fact, don't spend it at all. Put it in the bank! In 40 years, maybe you'll be able to afford a marble or something!""
4. Once a $200 question appeared later as a $32,000 question. Um, that's not good.
5. The questions from $100 to $1,000 are too difficult (compared to the show). For example, the show had a $1,000 question that was ""How many legs does a spider have?"" But the game had a $1,000 question that was ""What kind of object is a 'ginsu'?""
6. Once again, Regis is appallingly rude. Once I won $1,000 and he said, ""Not bad, But at least you should've known the last one. Come on! Or at least you should've GUESSED better!""
7. Regis only says ""Is that your final answer?"" whenever he wants to. Most of the time, your first answer IS your final answer, even if you happened to hit the wrong button by mistake.
8. There's a ridiculous time limit of 30 seconds per question. I've seen people on the show take as long as 17 minutes.
9. The Fastest Finger mode is a joke. You're supposed to hit a letter key when you think the four answers are in the correct sequence. You don't actually put them in order.
10. Regis is appallingly impatient. If you take too long on certain things (like the Fastest Finger mode, or saying how many contestants will play), he'll say, ""This game is over! I'm outta here!"", and the game quits on you. Yep, you're back to Windows! And guess what? Once you load it back up again.....
11. ......you'll have to sit through the introduction again!
12. There's a general lack of options. When you hit the Escape key, you bring up the option menu, and you have these options: Volume Up, Volume Down, Resume, Start Over, Quit. There's no way to make the questions easier or harder, and there's no way to skip the introduction.
13. Speaking of which, when you select Start Over, the whole program starts over. Yep, you'll have to sit through the introduction again!
14. Once again, Regis is appallingly impatient. If you take too long to write your name, Regis will say, ""Come on, it's not a big deal"", or ""This isn't a trick question, what's your name?"" If you take too long, he'll type whatever he wants (e.g. Kathie Lee Gifford).
15. When you use the Phone-a-Friend Lifeline, Regis calls one of HIS friends and they start chatting a little before they get to the question. Then he'll say to his friend, ""I've got a question for you"", as if you're not even there. I mean, come on, it's YOUR lifeline, not Regis's!
16. What's wrong with having an option to use the mouse?
17. When you say ""yes"" to the instructions, Regis only gives them to you once. This is especially annoying in the Fastest Finger mode, in which you're pretty much doomed to load the game up again once it quits.
18. Did I mention that Regis is appallingly rude and impatient?
Well, there you have it. This review pretty much goes to ALL the games in this series (19. The makers were kind enough to make more than one edition of this trash). One of the few redeeming qualities of this game is the CD has pretty art on one side. That way, the CD makes a colorful, if fragile Frisbee. Aside from ""Treasure Mathstorm!"" and all the other ""games"" in that series, this is the lamest excuse for a game I have ever played. And that is my final answer!",1.0
"I pre-ordered this game on Steam figuring I couldn't go wrong with Gearbox since I also play Borderlands 2 which is epic. I couldn't have been more wrong. The graphics are bad, the lines are so lame it's pathetic, the game play is boring as heck because all you do is switch guns and shoot aliens the ENTIRE game. Aliens are stupid looking and die in a quick fizzle - reflective of the poor graphics. Glad I bought Dead Space 3 to give me a relief from this game. Try DS 1,2 and 3 and have a great time, this is crud!",1.0
"I bought this with great expectations when I saw that Retro Studios had developed this game.  I'm a huge fan of the Metroid Prime series and the modern Donkey Kong side scroller games.

This was a HUGE let down for me.  Graphics are great, controls are fairly tight, the voice acting is great, and there's even some extra very-odd stuff, like personal voice journals from robots.  Robots that speak in a way that sounds more garbled than gibberish.  Customization for your ally Core-bots is flexible enough but not so huge that you'll waste hours tinkering with them.

Now for the cons... The story starts well fleshed, but gradually gets down to bare bones and beyond as you progress.  Controls get a bit wonky depending on camera position at times, and sometimes you can't climb up ledges that look perfectly accessible.  Difficulty is SO inconsistent.  Some enemies are extremely dull and simply jog around you waiting for you to finish them, while other enemies that are the EXACT same type as the dumb enemies are extremely smart and aggressive.  I've been in several situations where a group of enemy bots flanked me, took out my ally Core-bot, then annihilated me, all in seconds.  Ohhh, and I forgot... load and reloading times are horribly long!!  So, after a few minutes (literally) of reloading, I carefully approached the exact same group of enemies, same color configurations and all, then annihilated THEM in seconds.  This is a synopsis example, and the difficulty issue is much worse with the Guardian boss enemies.

Ah, then there's the in game bugs.... In over 27 years of gaming, I have NEVER played a game that has killed me so much...Simply by causing my character to fall through the ground and die.  Glitching through walls, floors, ledges, through enemies, INTO enemies.... it's amazing how buggy this game has been for me.

So, from my experience, I can't recommend this game to anyone.  As I said, I had high hopes for this game, and looking at it's surface, it looks fun, and during those very short times it runs fine, it truly is fun.  But there's simply too much wrong with this game for me to recommend it to anyone.",1.0
"I had looked forward to this game for months.  It installed without incident.  The problem I had was the tutorial, beginning with the elevator (lesson #4).  The booklet says to ""call elevator"".  I didn't have to because the elevator was already there with its door open.  Then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select ""basement level 3"".  Clicking on the control panel did not work.  What did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved.  Then I go to the very last Lesson (9) with the sniper rifle.  I could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial, and as a result could not play the game.  This game is loaded with bugs.  Don't take my word for it--go to eidosinteractive.com and look at the forums for Hitman.  I wasn't the only one to have trouble in the elevator.",1.0
I couldn't even put them on my controllers before the rubber tore.  Kind of disappointed.,1.0
"the infamous error 37 plagues us! Save your money for fallout or buy the witcher 3. Her are other awesome RPG's, persona 3, persona 4, dragon age inquisition, borderlands, and the list goes on. Don't buy a RPG that try's to pretend it's an MMO.",1.0
"Since all the reviewers here left outstanding comments, perceptions on size, compatibility, interface pro/con's, I'll keep this short:

After reading the PS3 firmware bricking updates (confirmed on the Nyko Web site), I unpackaged the Frontman for an initial-slash-last go round attempt at trying before trashing this would be paperweight. Surprisingly enough - when plugged directly into a USB hub, this controller worked without a hitch. (It did not, however, respond to being piggybacked to a GH5 wireless fob). Sensitivity, synchronicity remained consistent across several songs as well.

Advice sensically remains to stick to standard GH5 controllers. Still, if you've got a dormant Frontman lying around pre 3.1 firmware, it may be worth re-attempting a go.

**UPDATE (JAN 2011): No longer compatible w/ firmware updated PS3's, GH: WoR.",1.0
"This game looks great, but plays TERRIBLE.
The first thing you should know, is that this game has a god-awful camera angle to it.  I was constantly re-centering the thing, or would be walking in one direction, only to have the camera angle change and my guy would start walking off to the side.  When fighting swarms of enemies, it's impossible to see the people hitting you from behind your character, and that's even after messing with the camera-toggle moving it as far away as possible.  It's just not smooth at all.
Second, this game is trying to be some kind of action-rpg, but you constantly collect so many pieces of armor or weapons or gems or whatever, that you find yourself going into your equipment menu ALL THE TIME to see if that thing you just picked up is a better piece of armor then the one you are wearing.
Third, the game makes no sense.  After watching the movies and whatever - I have NO idea who I am or what I'm fighting against.  I was at the point that when a nonsensical cutscene came along, I would just pick up my phone and check my email.
Fourth, there's ZERO challenge to the game.  Sure, you can level up and get better armor and weapons, but YOU DON'T DIE in the game, so what's the point?  When you die, you have to sit through this annoyingly repetitive cutscene (check phone for email again!) and just start right off near where you died.  So you find yourself just holding down the trigger or holding down the right stick to attack over and over and over again until you die.  Come back to life - repeat - hold down trigger until you die again.  It's not fun.
Fifth, the voice acting is laughable.  Many cut scenes don't quite line up and the dialog is atrocious.  Many times while playing, your ""team"" will say the DUMBEST stuff; ""Think that's the last of 'em?""  Yeah - I've killed 2000 of those enemy-robot-alien whatevers and I'm sure THAT was the last one.  ""Medic!"" - a) there's no medic and b) you never die anyway so what are you crying about?
Sixth, your team is LAME.  They do very little, get lost most of the time, and make NO sense in their existence.  Either they die off (they get reborn at random times?) or get lost or just completely disappear.  Oh but don't worry, you'll still hear their annoyingly repetitive dialog CONSTANTLY, even when they AREN'T THERE.

It LOOKS like a decent game - a lot of thought went into the weapons and graphics and stuff, it just plays like utter GARBAGE.  I won it in about a week or so, and plan on throwing it out.  I'm glad I paid like $5 for it used.  This is easily the best-looking worst-playing game on the XBox 360, EVER.",1.0
I'm not paying this much for a bundle deal I found a bundle deal with the same PS4 500GB GTA V and the last of us for 50 dollars cheaper. it's the last of us bundle deal all you need to do is add GTA V to game to the list and that's it,1.0
"This game was an utter disappointment.  The music is absolutely terrible (possibly the worst of any video game).  And the graphics are retro looking.  Come on, with the power that the Xbox has I thought the graphics would be better.  The game is extremely difficult and is dull and lacks excitement.  The missions are all basically the same as eachother, which is to eliminate the enemy planes.  Don't run out and buy.  Rent it if you feel like it's something you'd like, but don't buy it unless you've rented and liked it.  I returned after the first day of having it.  My suggestion would be to buy a game worth the money, like Halo or Max Payne or anything but this.",1.0
these don't increase your accuracy! they are a total rip off. all they do is make your thumbs slip off the controller,1.0
"Bungie has got so greedy with this game. Adding micro-transactions has just killed the very little dignity this game had. I wouldn't mind if you were able to work for the things that are available for real money, but you can't. Plus this games community is just as bad as the cod community. Stay away from this game, for it is the justin beiber of video games.",1.0
I didn't order this,1.0
"Controller looks official on the page but is incredibly cheap and flimsy. Came out the envelope with faulty D-pad, and the ""analog sticks"" are actually digital octo-gate inputs, meaning they have no variable sensitivity and rather than go 360 degrees they have eight directions they register, period.

Complete waste of money, waste of time, cannot possibly recommend less.",1.0
Figures are backwards compatible but worlds are not.  Characters can't play other characters missions. Characters are restricted to their own world and toybox only.  Best idea on the planet to rid kids of parents money.  Worst idea ever for a PR friendly game.,1.0
"The instruction manual was missing, so I sent it back.",1.0
"The Intro lasted forever. . .so, I didn't really get much past it.  I have a very limited time for video games, and even though I paid $2.49 for it, this game wasn't worth the purchase price.",1.0
Way over price for what you get,1.0
"Horrible game that ruins the entire franchise.  I don't think it's cannon though.  Everything you know and love from Dragon Age 2 was sent to the latrine in this one.  Remember those snappy companions from DA2?  I guess they tripped and bumped their heads, cause in DA3, Varric barely says anything, and just stares at you with his open shirt and chest hairs hangin out.  They're all like that, and they have shiny lips enough to light a billboard sign in Times Square, and their skin shines like they're obsessed with baby oil.  Remember the cool fast paced action?  Nope.  Now you're playing a SINGLE PLAYER MMORPG that pretends to be open world, but there's nothing in it really.  Except a time sink, and monsters that either get you know xp to kill, and then a level 9000+ mob comes flyin in and CLEAN YOU CLOCK.  Dang ye n dang the horse that brung ye!  The only cool thing in teh game is the black unicorn.",1.0
I like all of the major Assassins Creed games made before this one and love part 3 and Black Flag but this one was a step back. I would give it more stars but it's a one star for the series. It felt like they were just making a game to push out and make money. Stuck in one city that every block looks the same. The game controls are terrible every time you get near a wall you get stuck to it. This often times makes the stealth parts impossible. If this don't step their game up I'm done with the series. Come to think of it this is becoming a problem with every game Ubisoft has made lately. If they want to be the new EA then screw them too.,1.0
"The game says it's open world...it's not, it says it has CO-OP 2-4 players it doesn't only xbox live multiplayer, the game froze on me during the immense amount of loading at the start of the game, the controls are not the best, when you die in multiplayer you still need to go through the immense amount of loading again before respawn which is just atrocious.  Over all could have been amazing but just simply sucks, false advertising.",1.0
"I had SERIOUS problems with this game. I have a Windows 7 Desktop with a REALLY good Video/Graphic card. It can play up to six or seven Sims 2 games no problem.

But THIS! I put this and Sims 3 in my computer and all HELL broke lose. The pets were deformed, the game moved REAL slow, took forever to load, etc. According to what I read, alot of people experienced this same problem with the 'deformed pets'. The only solution is to buy a new Video card, even though yours is really good.

 As far as I'm concerned, EA is too lazy and cheap to fix the problem. So basically you have to be rich and be able to afford a new Video card, a Computer tech to hire to install it into your processor, etc. It's a headache that is NOT worth it! If you can't afford all of that, then DON'T buy this game! Buy your kids Sims 2 instead.",1.0
Wast of money and time. It's no SSX game,1.0
What totally torques me off about this purchase is the fine print is not apparent until after I got the item and tried to play the game.  I do NOT want to play online multiplayer games at all; I only like to play single shooter games by myself!  So to find out only after I open the package that I WASTED my money is very unsetlling!  Very disappointed in myself for not doing more research and EVEN MORE disappointed in the game companies only offering these cool games for online play.  DOOM on you!,1.0
