"Game is 6 years old but still hold up very nice in 2017. At its heart the game is a fantasy open-world sandbox that presents you with countless options to whittle away the hours as you please ranging from resource gathering, crafting, exploring, tinkering with skills and builds, etc. The strength of this particular though is the main storyline with a decent narrative that you can always dive into once you grow weary of the 'side' stuff. Game also looks fantastic when played on a PS4 PRO on a 4K TV with HDR as it can run on native 4k.",4.0

"When Dead Rising first came out, HD tv was still on it's way. It was available but not everyone had upgraded. This was one game that you might have issues with if you didn't have one due to the incredibly small text that you needed to read. It is a fun experience, but it hasn't aged very well if you ask me. While there's bound to be some that consider it to be classic(it is), I'm betting there are more who will try the second one and never look back. Still, if you own an Xbox 360 then you should add this to the library. It's worth the price for what you get.",4.0
"The Telltale Games experience since ""The Walking Dead"" has largely been the same.  They tell complex stories with good episode-to-episode cliffhangers, all through a simple technically-flawed gaming engine.  I don't play their games for innovations in gameplay; I look for a good story at a relatively low price.  ""The Wolf Among Us"" fits the bill, quite admirably.  I won't elaborate too much on story and give you some bullet points that I think will help those of you on the purchase fence:

*  STORY AND ACTING
In a nutshell, ""The Wolf Among Us"" creates a film noir type of murder mystery involving fairy tale characters.  Bigby Wolf (you) are the sheriff trying to keep order in Fabletown however you see fit.  Without spoilers, you'll encounter characters such as Beauty and Beast dealing with marital secrets and woes, and Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum as private detectives unafraid to get their hands dirty and their pockets filled, and Ichabod Crane is politician personified.  The story might feel bogged down from time to time with detective sequences that ask you to explore every nook and cranny, but since this is a detective story, it actually feels like a logical pace as opposed to padding out the chapters.  Players get to make certain choices throughout the game which change the experience dramatically in a couple episodes.  The final scene in Chapter 5 is the same no matter what choices you make, but it's preceded by a scene which wonderfully examines choices the player has made from start to finish --- it's a well-written, organic reflection of your experience.  The vocal performances are mostly good, though Telltale's made a few choices that don't really help them in terms of visuals.

*  PRESENTATION
There's no getting around it: Telltale's game engine isn't doing their games any favors.  Action sequences and camera changes get choppy.  Characters move a tad stiff.  And worst of all, there is no longer an option to turn off the ""Will Remember That"" messages during crucial conversations.  I don't mind post-episode stat tracking to compare my choices versus other players, but let me enjoy subtleties while I can.  On the positive side, though, ""The Wolf Among Us"" uses a very pleasing color palette to compliment the seedy undercurrents of Fabletown's secrets.  This is a good-looking game that feels both like a comic and an artistic expression of videogame storytelling.  It might not animate too smoothly, but it's a pretty portrait.  I can't recall the music too well outside of a few tracks, but I don't remember finding it out of place, and remember finding it appropriate to the experience.

REPLAY FACTOR
*  This mostly depends on your love of the story but I would play this story again someday.  Players who want to earn 100% trophies will have to find all of the Book of Fables entries, which requires replaying certain scenes and choosing specific decisions.  In a weird way, I liked doing this so I could explore a few alternative possibilities.  They're not complete game-changers but nice deviations from my initial playthrough.

DISC VS DOWNLOAD
*  I've seen downloads go cheaper from time to time on the PSN Store, but I'll always prefer discs because it's nice to have a hard copy backup in case your system goes bad.  Plus you don't have to wait for downloads and installations.

*  RANDOM EPISODE THOUGHTS
I love Episode 1's suspenseful lead up to its final fistfight.
That Episode 1 shocker might not have been worth undoing.
Episode 3 is probably the most high stakes of the game.
Episode 5 features probably too much action sequences, but somehow everything is brought to a proper finale.
Did I mention that penultimate scene in Episode 5 where everything you've experienced in re-explored?

*  COMPARISONS TO OTHER TELLTALE GAMES
I prefer both seasons of ""The Walking Dead"" over this game, but I'll take ""The Wolf Among Us"" over ""Back To The Future"" or ""Jurassic Park"" any day.  You'll have to take my recommendation with a grain of salt because I actually liked ""Jurassic Park"" as a dumb B-movie experience.  Telltale hasn't finished releasing ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Tales From The Borderlands"" as I type this review.  So far though I enjoy my time with Bigby and the mysteries of Fabletown more.

FINAL RECOMMENDATION
I wouldn't pay more than 15 bucks for ""The Wolf Among Us"", mostly because of the technical imperfections with Telltale's gameplay and presentation.  But in terms of story, it's a good one.  The fantasy elements surpass their origins to create interesting characters and the morality choices play out in mostly logical narratives.  Wait for a dark evening, dim the lights, and explore the shadows of Fabletown!",4.0
"The Order is a very competent game on every level. Instead of rating a game on what you think it should be, trying rating it on what it is being offered. The Order isn't a perfect game, but it offers an entertaining, beautiful, intelligent, simplistic experience. All of the weapons handle differently, I had fun using all of them, which is rare for a game like this. The voice acting is top notch, near flawless. The character movement is a little sluggish, but that is the only negative I can think of. There are a lot of QTE's, dialogue, characters, all of which I had no problem with. If you enjoy a linear game with horror themes, that is exquisitely crafted,  with acceptable weapon variety, I would highly suggest this game.",4.0
"I'll steer clear from all the Securom talk and just focus on the game itself, but just to state that I didn't have any issues installing or running the game and the game hasn't crashed once.

Dead Space is a very good game.  The story line is really well done and the game play is done well too.  It's pretty scary throughout the game and I never found it boring. There are some neat areas where they do things with zero gravity, and the ability to slow things down.

Sadly though the game has some horrible controls.  Maybe it'll be patched, but at the moment the mouse controls are just super sluggish. It seems like they did a really bad port of the console version.  There are some work arounds by turning off VSYNC in the video options of the game and then maxing the mouse sensitivity.  For the most part that fixes a lot of the mouse issues, but it's still a little sluggish in some areas like around corners.

I chose to play the game on medium difficulty because of this. I didn't want to get overly frustrated with mouse aiming on a more challenging difficulty.  It's been a lot of fun and since it's not on extra hard difficulty I don't have to try swinging around and hitting 10 mobs at a time which is good.

The game also plays a lot like Bioshock in the ability to customize your character. You can upgrade your armor and weapons how you see fit (damage, capacity, armor, hitpoints, etc.)  Another unique aspect is the ability to shoot the limbs off all the mobs. The game revolves around this (shooting legs out to slow enemies down, shooting heads off, etc.)

Overall the game is fantastic.  If I had known beforehand, I would have picked this up for the 360 or PS3, but even though the controls are lacking, I had a blast playing it and would recommend people to try it out.",4.0
My husband absolutely loves this! The only problem we have is the controller charging cord is not long enough to reach from the ps4 to our couch. The controller doesn't hold a charge long enough to play half the day straight.,4.0
"Back in 2002 Luigi was given a second chance to star in his own adventure called Luigi's Mansion, and although it was a short journey it won the hearts of critics and fans. Now ten years later Luigi is summoned once again by the intelligent Professor E. Gadd to once again dawn his trusty flashlight and the new Poltergust 5000 to star in his newest adventure, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. With a lengthy adventure, that easily surpasses the predecessor, combined with some humorous comedic situations and an elegantly crafted world timing with intricate puzzles Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is an excellent reason to purchase a Nintendo 3DS.

Professor E. Gadd has spent his life researching paranormal activity, but when a mystical dark moon disappears from the sky of Evershade Valley, his ghostly allies turn hostile. In order to restore order Elvin Gadd contacts his friend Luigi, who is comfortably sleeping in his chair, to collect the shattered pieces of the artifact. Although the Professor can spark a few laughs the true humor of the game comes from the wacky animations: Luigi getting thrown into the wall by traps that open hidden areas; peering through crack in the wall and seeing ghosts gleefully performing misdeeds. These concepts are complemented by the superb sound design and soundtrack, adding more favor to the silly events as Luigi hums with the spooky music.

The atmosphere of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is its greatest accomplishment. The perfect combination of spookiness and child-like wonders adds charm to each of the well-designed capacious area. Suits of armor line the hallways waiting for unexpected trespassers and flashes of light cast shadows when shined in front of an object. Turning on 3D the effect allows for excellent depth-of-field in certain parts of the game, especially when the camera zooms out. Each mansion is saturated with large rooms littered with secrets that include traps, treasure, and hidden ghosts. The various safes, vents, plants, and other strange contraptions release bundles of coins, notes, and gold blocks that make interacting with every piece of the environment time well-spent.

However, exploring the mansions can be difficult since the mission structure follows a specific path and encourages you to follow it. The helpful map on the bottom screen ensures you don't get lost, but it would be nice if you were given more freedom. Each mission is divided into levels and Luigi is transported between them using a transporter called the Pixelshifter, which warps Luigi from one location after being converted in tiny blocks and then put back together. Although Professor Gadd constantly calls Luigi on his Dual Scream (a clever take on the original Nintendo DS) to inform him of his current progress and give him instructions for the set objective, it seems unnecessary to inform the player of everything they do. It becomes a vexing inconvenience after the first level.

Luigi has access to two tools to take the supernatural: his flashlight, whichcontains a dark-light attachment that reveals illusions, ghosts, and hidden objects, as well as his Poltergust 5000 vacuum. These are the only tools required to solve the many puzzles within each mansion and are properly equipped to handle any combat situation. By exposing the hearts of the ghost using his flashlight Luigi initiates a tug-of-war between the creatures and then suck them into his vacuum after draining all the health of his target, a power meter also appears that if charged can do a massive amount of damage for quicker battles. Missions all require a combination of catching ghosts and solving puzzles, ending with a boss fight that requires a combination of both. Anything in the environment can be important to your task, requiring careful observation and use of your dark-light. The puzzles are varied and rarely repeat the same pattern, offering new challenges as you progress through the game. Although Professor Gadd points you in the right direction, finding the solution to each problems is tricky but rewarding once you do.

Multiplayer is the most shocking addition to Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon called ScareScraper. Up to 4 players are sent into a random mansion and take control of different color variations of Luigi to clear each floor all the ghostly inhabitants, locating invisible ghost-dogs or racing to find a hidden hatch to the next area. Whether playing online,  local or download play, teamwork is essential to pass through each level and defeat the bosses, but it's clear that these modes were made to accompany 4-player cooperative play and taking on the multiplayer mode with less players can lead to frustration.

Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is a wonderful sequel. It allows Luigi a chance at the spotlight once again and show gamers that he can be just as entertaining as Mario. A fickle difficulty curve and a poor checkpoint system can lead to annoying situations but these are mostly minor concerns. Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon maintains the same charming formula that made the first game a success and returning to Luigi's newest ghost catching adventure is definitely worth taking.",4.0
"I had a lot of fun with this game, much more than I thought I would. Warcraft 3 is a good old-fashion real-time strategy (RTS) game, with a somewhat outdated resource collection model and base-building formula. It also aspires to be a roleplaying game (RPG), thought it is only partially successful. Overall, if you like RTS games, this one is worth a try. However, I found it not to be as good as some of the more recent games, like Rise of Nations and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War.

Gameplay: Warcraft 3 is remarkably like Warcraft 2 in a lot of ways, which is both good and bad. On the good side, it's fairly easy to learn and quite fun for a while. You choose one of four races to play (which are all distinct); gather gold, lumber, and food; build structures and units; explore the map; and conquer your enemies. It's a very typical 1990s-style RTS game. However, Warcraft 3 adds hero units to the mix, which greatly impact gameplay. These units can gain levels as in a RPG-style game and have special abilities. You really cannot win a game without them. Each race has a choice of 4 heroes to choose from (with The Frozen Throne expansion loaded) and there are neutral heroes that can be recruited. The hero model works quite well with the single-player campaign, since it weaves them into a broad story. However, it makes skirmish games a little awkward, since you are required to both build bases and find creeps (random monsters) for your hero to fight in order to gain levels.

The single-player campaign is both quite long and well done. Actually, it seemed a little too long once I played through the original campaign and the Frozen Throne expansion. The story is the typical good vs. evil theme, which gets really hard to follow by the mid-point. However, the missions are generally well done, with a good mix of RPG-style adventuring and a heavy-dose of base-building and conquest. The missions are designed to allow you the chance to play all four races, and I didn't get the sense that they were just practice for multiplayer online games. That is, for solo gamers like myself, Warcraft 3 has a substantial amount of single-player content.

Warcraft 3 is good, but does have some issues. Some of the single-player missions are quite hard and will require much reloading of saved games in order to complete. Still, the AI can be a little lame. There were countless times that my base would be invaded, and my units would not automatically move to fight the enemy. However, AI enemies do fight smart, often first attacking your units that can do the most damage to them. Rather surprisingly, the game does not have a pause feature so that you can look around the battlefield and give orders while pausing. And unlike recent RTS games, Warcraft 3 limits you to very small armies. You'll be lucky to have 20 fighting units at any given time. Additionally, the game just seems behind the times in other ways. The camera doesn't really zoom, graphics are cartoonish, and the micromanagement can be burdensome at times.

As with every other Blizzard product I've played, the game was perfectly stable and well polished, and I came across no bugs or typos. In addition to a single-player campaign that will last around 35+ hours for the average player, there are a large number of skirmish maps included, multiplayer capacity, and a map editor. As usual, Blizzard has supported the game well with patches and new official maps that are downloadable at their website.

Graphics: The typical Warcraft visuals. A bit cartoonish, but with a lot of vivid colors and diverse environments. Spell effects look convincing, and there are day & night cycles that give the world a living feel. The game is actually cute in many ways and is probably supposed to be that way. The graphics will not win any awards, but they do serve their purpose. As with Diablo 2, Warcraft 3 has some of the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game.

Sound: There is a lot of great voice acting in the game. Some of it is very funny. The music is also well done and appropriate to the mood of the game.

Overall, I recommend Warcraft 3 (plus the expansion) to anyone interested in RTS or fantasy games. It's a well-made strategy game with lots of challenges, a epic (though rambling) story, and an RPG element in the form of heroes (which, again, can be a plus or a minus). If you can get past all of the micromanagement that the game requires and some other outdated elements, Warcraft 3 should provide many hours of entertainment.",4.0
"Purchased this mouse to go with MSI laptop. Already have a G400s (which is awesome) that goes with a desktop. I have to say the DS100 is not too shabby in comparison, definitely in line with where it should be for 60% of the price.  I have to say that one of the primary reasons I gave this mouse a look was because of the attention to detail that apparently went into my MSI GP60 laptop.  Everything on the laptop works very well and is very cost effective.  In particular I liked the SteelSeries tactile feedback keyboard on it.  If MSI built a mouse that had the same practical/sporty feel, I knew I'd be sold, and so I was.  My initial impression was that it was a rather cheap mouse, and I didn't get much of a deal, but that eventually changed with use.

Pros:
-Textured coating on the top surfaces of mouse have a nice feel.
-Pleasant color options (Red/Green/Yellow/Blue/Teal/Purple) all look good.
-Good tracking with none of the lag issues some other users have run into.
-Good software (had a slight hiccup on install, showed ""program not responding"" but installed correctly after a couple minutes)
-Looks nice next to an MSI laptop :)  A touch of sexy without crossing the line into embarrassing gamey gaudiness.
-Braided cord is a good length and stays out of the way better than the standard rubber cord on the G400s.
-Lift off distance (how far you have to pick the mouse up before it stops tracking) is excellent.  I'd say it is somewhere in the range of 1.5 CD widths, roughly half of the G400s.
-The mouse wheel is grooved with a rubber coating and there is a very subtle click with each notch as you scroll.  This is the attention to the little things I was hoping for.

On the Fence:
-The low profile of the mouse feels sporty but I find the bottom of my thumb just grazing the mousepad because there simply isn't much room below the thumb buttons.
-Ergonomics.  Both buttons are slightly grooved instead of flat.  I think I'd actually prefer slightly convex to concave, but it's fine.  No crampy issues or anything like that, but the mouse doesn't scream ""comfort"" so much as ""sporty"" and I think it favors palm grippers over fingertip grippers like myself.
-There is minimal texture on the sides of the mouse.  No issues gripping/picking up mouse, but some will want more.

Cons:
-It is a laser mouse which means there is supposedly a little more interpolation/inaccuracy relative to a good optical mouse.  Having used the G400s, I can say that internet connection and fatigue are far larger factors.  I haven't noticed much if any difference.
-If you leave the LED on, the mouse surface heats up slightly, causing sweaty palms.  Leaving the LED off fixes issue.
-The mouse is surprisingly heavy for such average-sized mouse and quite tail-heavy.  When I purchased I was hoping the 130+gram weight included the cord...not so.  If this mouse were about 80g (like a G100s) and kept all its features, I would probably rate it over the G400s.  As it is it is this is still a very minor gripe.

In Summary:
I don't foresee having any issues with this mouse after a few weeks of heavy use.  While there is a TON of competition at the $25-30 range, I have no regrets with this purchase.",4.0
"Update! I hope they add in auctions so people can sell liveries. Fun game and beautiful graphics.

Just got mine and will adjust rating accordingly. For those complaining about credits, you will be emailed 500k and inside the box you should have another 500k-1mill. I'm in a 12+ gig update. Will update this review afer I get track time and not just bonuses. Hope this game is great!

Update! I like it, super fast load times. I really need 4k, my monitor doesn't do it justice. Really nice graphics, I wish there was in depth tuning like old motor city online days. Also a drag strip would be nice. Fun game, definitely worth picking up if you are a casual player.

A few quirks to mention, penalties seem to favor the aggressor, Been in races where I seen a 27 second penalty from multiple hits from others, they put you into the wall you get s 5 second penalty.  Still a fun game, I'm sure they will patch this.",4.0
"This game is great to unlock easy achievements for XBOX 360 users. In a day where most achievements have to be earned online, this game offers less than 100 points for online use. I picked up 395 points in one game. LXLUTHR on XBOX Live",4.0
"Prior to testing out the headset I installed the firmware update for the Xbox One controller.  It was very easy to set up and get the unit working with Xbox.  Sound quality was very good with pleasant sound - not too bass heavy or unbalanced.  The unit was fairly comfortable though a little tighter on the head than I would have preferred.

My only minor complaint is that I wish the headset would have been designed to be completely wireless.

All in all this headset works well and it is a lot of fun to use.",4.0
"The Good: Two excellent games for one small price, Ghost of Sparta has a lot of memorable moments and feels like a console counterpart, Chains of Olympus has some great magic items

The Bad: Chains of Olympus feels weaker and less epic than Ghost of Sparta, no exclusive extras, both games look dated and ugly compared to console God of War games

God of War is one of the best action adventure games ever made. It pioneered everything we see in the genre today and there are dozens of copy cats. God of War helped pave the way for cinematic gameplay and pretty much made quick time events an everyday thing in games. God of War also has one of the best combat systems every created, as well as memorable mythology and one of the most recognized characters to date. Origins Collection puts two of the PSP's best titles on one Blu-Ray disc. These are remastered in 1080p HD and look great. While each has its own issues, this is well worth a purchase for any God of War fan.

Chains of Olympus

This was the first ever portable God of War game and it blew everyone's expectations out of the water. Not only for the game itself, but the PSP. No one knew the system could pull off this great technical feat. You can read my review on Olympus for the PSP itself, and a more in-depth look, but after playing it again on the PS3 I noticed that, compared to Ghost of Sparta, it doesn't stack up. Even after playing God of War III I notice a lot of things that annoy me in Olympus.

Firstly, the game lacks the huge epic set pieces of the console games, as well as a lack of bosses. Sure there are a few memorable moments in Olympus, but there are only three boss fights and they aren't that amazing. The first boss feels pretty boring compared to other first bosses in the series, and the locales are pretty generic for a God of War game. Olympus stuck to the basics of God of War and kind of played it safe. There are some interesting magic items like being able to reflect projectiles and Efreet. The combat system is almost exactly like the first game, which isn't a bad thing, but long time fans will be disappointed about this.

Secondly, the game is super short. You can beat it in about 4 hours which is two long sit-downs. The story isn't as detailed or in-depth as other games in the series. Kratos is just trying to find his daughter Calliope while still seeking revenge on the Gods. Overall, Chains of Olympus is a warm-up for the more epic Ghost of Sparta.

Score when released on PSP: 9

Score on PS3: 8

Ghost of Sparta

This is more like it. More bosses, more memorable moments, and completely different locales. There's even a whole new gameplay element here which is the Thera's Bane. Like in God of War III you have a red meter that sets your blades on fire for extra damage and makes you invincible to some attacks. Right from the start the game feels like a better, heavier God of War game than Olympus. Olympus started off kind of weak, but Sparta throws you right into the water (literally) with a pretty epic boss fight against a Scylla. The game has more puzzles, and the boss fights are pretty epic. The final boss against the God of Death, Thanatos, is pretty epic because you fight with a certain someone.

The story is even more memorable because you are searching for your brother Deimos while still seeking revenge on the Gods. There are some memorable moments here that top even some of the console games in the series like giving Kind Midas a beat down. The new magic items, however, aren't as interesting as I had hoped this time around. Boreas' Wind freezes enemies, but I rarely used it. The Eye of Atlantis felt kind of weak and didn't do as much damaged as hoped even fully leveled up.

Overall, Ghost of Sparta is much better with memorable moments involving more enemies, longer gameplay (about 6 hours), and more bosses. The fights system is tweaked to feel different from Olympus. The game even looks better because Sony finally unlocked the full 333Mhz of the PSP processor so Ready at Dawn was able to push the system to its full limits. Ghost of Sparta is a memorable God of War game and will probably become a fan favorite.

Score when released on PSP: 8.5

Score on PS3: 8.5

Overall, the entire collection is excellent and well put together. I was disappointed in not seeing any extra features exclusive to this collection, but each game has a Challenge of the Gods that will keep fans busy for a while. With full trophy support for each game you are bound to have a couple dozen hours of fun here.",4.0
"Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, is the new MK game on store shelves. I myself usually purchase MK merch when it drops, so I thought i'd give this game a try without even bothering to rent it first. And in a small way, i'm relieved that it didn't disappoint too much.

MKSM is by far probably the goriest Mortal Kombat in the series, to date. So if you're looking for a game full of blood and guts, this game is right up your alleyway. It also strays away from the norm, of the MK genre. It isn't a fighting game. It's an action/adventure game, with somewhat of a comparison to God of War, and Devil May Cry. Though gorier than DMC, it isn't quite as fun as DMC. As per God of War...it beats both of these games, hands down.

Anyways...yeah. This is a game full of violence, bloodshed, fatalities (ten per character), multalities (fatalities that kill multiple enemies on screen), and ofcourse, brutalities. Brutalities are basically the same as multalities, but the screen doesn't fade during brutalities, and you're actually able to control your character while doing them.

The storyline of MKSM is pretty much that of MK2, but...the events that lead up to it, and a few events DURING it. Such as the final boss fight (wont give anything away).

Like all games though, MKSM comes with a few (minor, and at times major) flaws.

-The battleing is pretty...repetative and at times, aggrovating and boring.

-The game itself is extremely short, clocking in at about 10 hours of gameplay (maximum), if you're experienced enough.

-Some of the puzzles in the game will annoy the living crap out of you.

-Fatality and multality sequences all happen in the same position (infront of the enemy), and never with the actual stage scenery in the background (the screen just turns black and that move is done...just like in the past 2 PS2 MK games).

-The game secrets (such as unlocking the MK2 fighting game) are at times, really hard to get, and MOST require ko-op gameplay to obtain.

-The characters at times can look really choppy (not alot, but you can really notice it, after comparing the Tarkatan warriors to other character models such as Kitana. Kitana looks better, whereas the Tarkatan warriors look like crap.)

-And to top it all off...the voice acting in the cutscenes is horrible. Cheesy as all hell. Even some of the dialogue itself is pretty stupid and pointless.

But despite all these flaws, I found Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, to be a pretty enjoyable game. It sure isn't the BEST beat em up action/adventure game on the market (I leave that title to God of War), but it's still a pretty enjoyable game nonetheless, if you're a fan of the MK series.

In the end, i'd only suggest this as a buy, to dedicated MK fans that have to have everything MKwise. Otherwise, only rent this to see if it suits your tastes.

By the way, this game is TEN TIMES better than the 2 absolutely disgraceful action/adventure MK titles that came before it, ""Mytholigies: Sub-Zero"", and ""Special Forces."" Those sucked, and weren't enjoyable in the least. Whereas ""Shaolin Monks"" proves enjoyable.

Give it a try...judge it for yourself.

I give MKSM 4/5 stars, due to the flaws the game contained that didn't seem to really effect the fun factor of the game at all. If the fun factor would've been effected, i'd have only given this game 3/5 stars.",4.0
"I am quite used to Logitech hardware. I have used everything they produce, from speakers to keyboard, cameras and mices.
I am not a fan of their configurations softwares that are not always up to par, although they seem to have improved greatly in the recent years.
This brings me to the review of the logitech G500s. I owned its predecessor (G500) and it happened to fail on me a few weeks before I got this one. It did not completely fail, just that it sometimes double-click when I click only once on the finger button.
This one seems very similar in design and style. I like the braided cable but it may not be to everyone's taste because it can grate on whatever it gets in contact with and offer some type of resistance that hampers the full fluidity of the movement.
There are plenty of buttons, ideal for gaming although some are very close from each other. In clear, it may take time to get used to it.
The configuration is easy and you can assign some special command to most or pick whichever you prefer.
The handling is fair. The weights are a gimmick in my opinion.
Now, considering the price range, I may recommend instead the G700 which can be used either wireless or cabled.
I am also frustrated by the choice of mices. They are almost all within a few dollars from each other and hard to differentiate.
So let's resume:

The Pros:
- Adjustable DPI (very useful to switch while gaming or between games and other programs)
- Nice handling
- Plenty of buttons
- Solid cable

The Cons:
- Braided cable may make the movements less smooth.
- Same price as higher level mices from the same brand
- Buttons not ergonomically placed.",4.0
"When you consider the pricepoint of this game (as of today, $35), I think it's a good buy for someone interested in off-road racing.  I come from the world of off-road R/C, so this game interested me.

The game is stable, has satisfactory graphics, and a soundtrack that gets a little old.  What I like about the game is it's VERY easy to pick up, but as you play it you realize that there are a lot of subtleties to master to get the best laptimes.  The game rewards you for preloading your jumps, taking the right line, and not hacking other riders.

I would have liked to have seen slightly better graphics and a customizable soundtrack, but other than that, I think it's a good game, especially for the price.  I'd rent it first before you buy, but if you like this type of racing, you'll probably enjoy it.",4.0
"This is my first Nintendo console that i have bought with my own money $293.99. I had the Wii, first console my family ever owned besides the Game Boy Advance and DS handheld. I wanted the Wii U mainly for the Wii U games that are/will be coming out. I have always loved Nintendo for their fun gameplay and nostalgia. This is a VERY detailed, lengthy review about this new console and its games. You can skip the technical specs sections if you'd like. Just search for the What to Expect sections in each of the sections. I did it this way to satisfy both the technical and general people out there, at least I hope I do.

The Console (4 stars)
Technical Specs
On the front of the console it has three buttons, the power button (which does not stick out like the Wii did, you have to push in to turn it on/off), the eject button and the sync button. The power button and the eject button have a light next to them. I like the disc light because its bright and you can easily tell if you have a disc in the console. It has a sync button to sync the Gamepad and Wii remotes to the Wii U.
The front also has the familiar SD card slot cover. Inside it has the SD card slot, and two USB slots for an external hard drive (if you need it) or the gamecube adapter (which I don't have).
On the back it has an HDMI port for HD experience, a slot for A/V or composite cables, the sensor bar and the AC power supply. You can use the old A/V or composite cables and sensor bar from the old Wii. It has a fan in the back as well as on the top and side of the console. (Now that i think of this, you can play the Wii U without a tv with most games, you can even play it in the car if you really wanted to)

What to Expect (Console):
If you had the Wii, the Wii U console itself looks a lot like the original Wii. It is small (barely not as small as Wii though) and a tiny bit heavier if i remember what the Wii's weight was. This console is black, you can easily see dust and smudges on it but other than that, it blends in well with other electronics.
It has 32GB or storage, although after you load the console, it will be around 20GB of storage which is plenty of space if you don't download games (games can be 1.5GB-20GB each). This is a quiet machine, and it works well with most games (not with LEGO games for some reason, from what I've read). It comes pre-installed with Super Mario 3D World and Nintendo Land (see Games section below). It also comes with the Youtube channel, Amazon instant video, Netflix, Hulu plus, Wii U chat, and Wii Menu (to play old Wii games), Miiverse (a social network), Nintendo eShop (like an updated version of the Wii Shop Channel), Nintendo TVii (never played around with that), notifications and download management. It has Mii Maker and Daily Log (similar to the calendar on Wii to see how long you have been playing a game)

The Gamepad (4 stars)
Technical Specs
This is the new controller for Wii U. It has a 6.2 inch touchscreen (854x480). Technical dimensions: 5.3  0.9  10.2 inches. It is very lightweight even though it looks heavy. It is a big controller. It has left and right analog sticks. You can push them in as well (much like the PS controllers). On the left of the touchscreen it has the left control stick at the top, the D-pad, and a place to tap your amiibo. On the bottom of the touchscreen it has the home button (which has a blue ring around it) and a mic as well as a battery light indicator, tv button (to control your tv), and the power button (to turn off the console and Gamepad at the same time). It has dual stereo speakers on the left and right. On the right of the touchscreen you have the right control stick, a,b,x,y buttons, and the + and - buttons (+ is start and - is select). On the top of the touchscreen is a camera and a sensor bar.
On the bottom of the Gamepad, it has a optional place to hook up the Gamepad to charge. On the top of the Gamepad, it has the rounded L and R buttons, volume control, tv remote sensor, headphone jack, and AC adapter plug to charge your Gamepad. It has a slot for the stylus (included) and the zl and zr buttons on the back of the Gamepad. It has a nice rumble feature. The screen itself looks good, but not HD quality. The battery life sucks. It only lasts 3.5 hours until you have to charge it again. This is a major flaw but you can buy a battery from Nintendo that would last up to 8 hours, or you can get the Pro Controller that will last 80+ hours! (Pro Controller does not have a touchscreen so you have to use the TV and most most(?) games let you play with the Pro Controller.

What to Expect (Gamepad):
You can hold the Gamepad quite comfortably. It has a nice rumble feature. The display looks good although not as good as HD on the tv. You can use it to play games. You also can physically move the Gamepad around kinda like the Wii remotes in certain games. Some games  require you to use both the tv and Gamepad (Nintendo Land), but most games (like Super Mario 3D World) can let you play with only the TV or Gamepad separately. The Gamepad is a bit bigger than what I thought (almost as big as the console itself) but I like it. It is also black, so prepare for some smudges. You can also see smudges on the touchscreen but if you use the stylus that helps.
In order to play multiplayer, you have to have wii remotes (and nunchucks possibly). You cannot have more than one Gamepad per console (thank goodness too because the Gamepad is very expensive, about $110 each). This is a unique way to play multiplayer because player 1 plays with the Gamepad while the rest of the players look at the tv to play the same game.
The one major flaw I have with this controller is the battery life. It only has 3.5 hours on a charge. If you don't like it, you can buy another battery that would last up to 8 hours. They also have the Wii U Pro controller which does not have a touchscreen but has 80+ hours of battery life!

Software on Wii U (5 stars)
Wii U has many features. The one I use the most is called Miiverse, which is a social networking site. It has very strict guidelines, meaning you cannot post spoilers (unless other people don't deem it as such), you cannot bully or harass someone, i have seen some swearing in posts but not very often at all. You should not (maybe cannot?) post personal information about people or yourself on Miiverse. You can take snapshots of the gameplay in certain games, draw pictures, ask questions, post and see posts about the game all while playing the game or level. I think it is really cool and this is free by the way.
The Internet Browser is great, although it took a little while to get used to. It is the FASTEST browser on a console to date (even faster than PS4 and Xbox One browsers which I was surprised). It is almost as fast as Firefox on a computer but it depends on your internet. You can watch Youtube in HD using the Browser or the Youtube app, but I prefer on the browser because its easier to navigate. You can show the video on the tv and continue browsing for another one during the video. You can also hide the browser from the tv by drawing a curtain so that you can enter your passwords in secrecy thanks to the Gamepad.
You can go on the eShop to download full games (you can download games like Super Mario 3D World, DK Country: Tropical Freeze, etc) and download old classics on Virtual Console (NES, SNES, N64 although N64 games are barely being put on Virtual Console). But the full games costs a dear price (its usually more expensive downloading it, plus you lose a bunch of GB). If you plan on downloading games, you must buy an external hard drive for the Wii U.
You can transfer all of your Wii data from the Wii to the ""Wii Menu"" on Wii U (the console goes into Wii Mode to play Wii games) by doing a Wii system transfer (i never did it but i am thinking about doing it). Even your Wii shop points transfer over. The channels like the Youtube chanel, Everybody votes Channel do not transfer. All your Virtual Console games transfer and you can even pay $1.50 (or $2?) to transfer from the ""Wii Menu"" of Wii U to the Wii U Menu so that you can play using the Gamepad as the controller and tv instead of playing it in Wii Mode and playing with Wii remotes on the tv.

Games (5 stars)
The discs are cool actually. The disc itself on the flip side (where the laser reads the disc) looks blue to me. They rounded the edges of the disc so that it feels comfortable to hold. I never liked handling discs but I can hold these Wii U discs all day! ;)
Super Mario 3D World came pre-installed (which means it is on the system, it did not come on a disc). It is pretty fun to play, it is the traditional Mario (i can remember Super Mario Land on the old Gameboy from playing this game) but it adds some new elements to it. My favorite affect on this game is the rain hitting the touchscreen. It's as if the touchscreen was a window and rain hits it and you can see the raindrops or the rain falling on the window. Its pretty cool.
Nintendo Land is also fun to play, its the Wii Sports of Wii U essentially, only this game is way way better than Wii Sports. You have to try it out.
They are coming out with new games as well for this year: Mario Maker, Star Fox, Splatoon, etc. A new Zelda game (the worlds are absolutely massive according to Nintendo) is coming sometime next year in 2016. So far I have played Super Mario 3D World, Nintendo Land, and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (which i will review after I am done with this one). I love all of these games so far, they do not disappoint and they all look great in HD. All games are in 720p at 30fps or full 1080p at 60fps. I can't wait to get Super Smash Bros. for Wii U (on its way) and Mario Kart 8 (I've heard good things about both games). Some games have DLC (downloadable content) which you can buy at reasonable prices. For example, for Mario Kart 8 you can buy the ""Pack 1 + Pack 2 Bundle"" which has 6 characters (from The Legend of Zelda X bundle {Bundle 1} and Animal Crossing X bundle {Bundle 2}. This large bundle comes with 6 characters, 8 new vehicles and 16 tracks. As a bonus, it comes with 8 new colors for Yoshi and Shy Guy. All of this for $11.99 which will be available in May 2015. If you bought Bundle 1 or Bundle 2 separately, you cannot get this sweet deal. Just things like that.

Anyways, I really like this system although it can be slow at times (loading times are ridiculous for DK Country: Tropical Freeze because the console is underpowered) but overall I really enjoy it. The console works very well and you can do all sorts of things with it. The gameplay is again different as you add a second screen to the experience.

Thank you for reading and please let me know in the comments what you think and if I made any sense or not.",4.0
"My 4 year old son loved this game and is able to play through most of it on his own without help but the game is very short. It can probably be played in about 2 hours. He has played it a few more times, but he already knows what is going to happen and it isn't challenging anymore.",4.0
"Well I was almost torn to give it a five stars but a couple things made my mind. First is wasn't super super good like some other games (Animal Crossing, Kingdom Hearts, and Zelda) so I felt I might have to rate it lower. All the same there can be different levels of five stars. So what finished making my mind up was the fact that one: Your companions will constantly kill themselves... And are of almost no use. And Two: You need a more flexible save system! This last fact was a little painful in some dungeons. Of course these were not the only flaws but are the main ones.

pros:
  Well now that I have lowered the game by no means run away. It was very fun. I finished in in 22 hours.

the story is nice (big bonus)but not extremely geared towards much older audiences. Still I found it good and am rather old myself.

game play is not hardest in world. Maybe geared towards a young audience but I found it still challenging. Just don't go in and expect to die 60 times.

Music is not bad not great just good old good. voice acting A+,

Graphics are great!!! wonderful

Overall nice fun game. If you want something nice, homy, not incredibly challenging then this is a great game! There are better out there but this has set A standard for nice rpg. not like anything I have yet played and I am glad I played it.",4.0
"The first Castlevania game I ever played was IV on the SNES back in 1992. I became a fan and even went as far as buying an old NES to just play the first three. As fun as the new Castlevania LOS and the 3D PS2 releases are, I'll always have a special affinity for the retro 2D classics.
Castlevania Chronicles takes elements from I, III, and IV to present entertaining, albeit slightly outdated, gameplay, graphics and sound. I say outdated considering Castlevania IV came out in 1991 on the SNES with Simon able to whip in 8 directions and swing over chasms along with some very creative levels which utilized the SNES' scaling FX chip. Chronicles came out two years later in 1993, yet Simon can only whip in 5 directions (horizontal, down-horizontal, and straight down) and there is no swinging ability. The graphics also took a step backwards, yet nothing too drastic. Even with enhanced graphics via the arranged mode, IV looks and plays better. I figure it's due to Chronicles originally being released on a system that did not have the same capabilities as the SNES, so the discrepancies are forgivable. It's just too bad the Konami didn't beef it up with more than just a few improvements in the graphics and music for the PSX release in 2001.
Still, this game should be a part of every Castlevania fan's library, if not of every retro gamer's. The graphics are not too much of an eyesore, the music is great, and the gameplay is fantastically fun. There is a great variety of enemies to battle and the levels have that classic Castlevania creativity. I've read some reviews that it is a more difficult game. But if you're a Castlevania vet, it's nothing you can't handle. Even in hard mode, I'd say it has about the same difficulty as Dracula X.",4.0
"Virtues Last Reward. The title stems from the idea that in order to succeed, you need to do good things, but sometimes being good will get you killed. Who can you really trust? Who are these eight people trapped with Sigma (the main lead who's perspective you play from), and most of all, who is the mastermind that trapped you in this warehouse? Who is Zero?

For those who haven't played the Zero Escape series, they are essentially mature themed visual novels with puzzle sections you need to solve in order to continue the games plot. Along the way, you'll need to gather hints, codes, passwords, and keep track of the various branching paths you take in order to unlock the games 24 different ending that all lead to the true ending. I recommend keeping a notepad and pen with you while you play, as it will help you greatly to keep track of data and puzzle information. The game can be played as a stand alone experience, but I highly recommend playing 999 before VLR, as events in that game will make the various story elements (especially near the games end) much easier to grasp and understand. I got about 40 hours worth of play time from VLR, but that was probably padded greatly due to me being stuck on the games sometimes unfair/unclear puzzles. I'm looking right at you Control Room Puzzle Room!

One thing that may put you off if you loved 999 is the voice overs that happen during the novel portions of the game. The audio CANNOT be turned off in any way. You can however select between a Japanese and English audio track, but still, how hard would it have been to include an option to must the voices? I want to be reading the story, not have it be read to me. A minor complaint when all is said and done, but prevents me from giving it 5 stars.

Now might be a good time to bring up the elephant in the room, the infamous save glitch. If you save your progress while in the PEC Puzzle Room, or the Crew Quarters Puzzle Room, there is a possibility of a glitch occurring, causing your save data to be deleted. I found that the other puzzle rooms were perfectly safe to save in, but I would highly recommend saving during the novel portion of the game if you can help it. It should also be noted that this glitch only seems to happen on the 3DS version of the game, and not the PS Vita version. Here is a full length article from Aksys game explaining the issue, and how you can avoid it.

[...]

Overall, if you loved 999, you should play this immediately. Even with its minor bugs, forced voice work, and sometimes unfair puzzles, the story and tension the game builds is fantastic. It really is unlike anything on the 3DS/Vita you have ever seen, and must be played to be believed. As long as you can look past some of the minor faults, Virtues Last Reward is (dare I say) a rewarding game experience that I highly recommend.",4.0
"The Xbox is the most powerful video game system (until Xbox 360 comes out).

Graphics 10/10 - this console has awesome graphics!

Features  8/10 - This thing does it all, from playing music CDs to playing DVD movies. Unfortunately, you have to spend another $$ on a DVD remote in order to watch DVD movies.

Durability/Performance 10/10 - This console has a very strong covering and it weighs about 10-12 lbs! The Xbox is definitely a very durable console. Also the Xbox has no history of Disc Read Errors.

Design 10/10 - The design of this console is very cool because it has a futuristic look.

Online 8/10 - Don't get me wrong, the Xbox has the best online service (Xbox Live), but unfortunately THERE IS A MONTHLY FEE.

Games 2/10 - The Xbox has the poorest selection of games I've ever seen. Almost every game is a war-like game. When I go down the PS2 and Gamecube game aisles, there are a lot of great games, however when I go down the Xbox aisle, I feel like vomiting! (Yep, it's that bad.)

Overall: This is a great system. It has an awesome design and lots of features. Unfortunately the game selection is aweful, but nonetheless you will have a lot of fun playing this system. The Xbox 360 is coming out by the end of the year, so if you are planning on buying an Xbox, I recommend you buy one now. Hopefully, when the 360 comes out, Microsoft will keep making games for this Xbox.",4.0

"Well I just got it last night and I have to say, if you are a  FFVII fan, then this is a no brainer. if not, you may not want to grab this too quickly. I played for about 2 hrs last night and so far it's not bad but you still kind of feel that it's still not the FFVII that you have been waiting for on the PSP. BUT....it's still worlds away much better than the last offering. So far playing, there are a lot of very well rendered CG cutscenes from the beginnign an excellent tutorial telling you how everything works, and a nice intro to the characters and an early appearance by Sephiroth!!  (Not a spoiler because it's not what you think!)

So far, the story is pretty good (due to the cutscences). My only gripe is, for an action RPG, there is a lot of extra button pushing you have to do to play...X controls your attacks but instead of having another button to use your magic attacks, you have to use the bumpers to slide to  the appropiate spell you want to use and...hit X... ...and that can be very critical when fighting a boss! Nothing worse than thinking one thing and your fingers hit another at a critical moment. I think that Square should have considered putting a Spells button elsewhere.
The DVM is actually kind of fun but I wish there was a bit more control over that.

But still, if you loved FFVII this is the game you wanted...I give it a 4 out of 5.",4.0
I really enjoyed it.,4.0
"I really enjoyed this game and got immersed in the action. I will admit that there were times where I was surprised by the level of gore, but that sort of thing does not offend me. But I will warn parents with small children (I have two of my own) that this game is not for the faint of heart and is significantly violent/disturbing at certain parts.

I've never played Farcry or some games that people compare this new Tomb Raider to, but I know that when I played the game it felt like a mixture of Tomb Raider and at parts it was creepy like Silent Hill with all of the dead bodies. While I did not watch the entire show, my wife watched Lost and said some of the story that takes place on the island compares to the feeling she got from that particular show, which makes sense from what I've seen.

Very fun game with a lot of action, weapon upgrades, and little side quests that were enjoyable. My only somewhat gripe is that the enemies were not as intelligent as I would have hoped. I usually tried to kill them without setting off the alarm, but even when I did (on the normal setting) I was usually able to kill them all very easily once the alarm was off (other than on a few really crazy scenes that might be the exception). The leveling up options are also fun, and the mixture of Survivalist, Brawler, and (I think Hunter?) trees were a lot of fun to tweak. Whatever options I chose, lets just say I was never out of ammo (but I mostly used the bow...man I loved that bow). I'll try it on hard mode and if the AI level increases I'll change my review to a solid 5 stars. Wish I could give it a 4.5.

This game was entertaining, and yes, was a lot different than the original Tomb Raiders. But I enjoyed it. And for the record, I buy a ton of products from Amazon, but this particular game was a last minute purchase at the BX here on base. I'm glad I made the purchase and still thought I'd leave an honest review here on Amazon.",4.0
"Good game, not quite what I expected but, still good.",4.0
"This is a traditional point-n-click adventure set in Egypt at the time of Cleopatra. The game comes on one DVD which has to remain in the drive during play.

You play in first person as Thomas, an apprentice astrologer. You find your girl, Iris, and her father, Akkad, have disappeared. The object of the game is to find out what happened and why and track them down.

Control is mouse only.

Graphics are good standard, with flowing water. The game is in 3D.

Ambient sounds are well done. Voice acting merely so-so. Lines seemed rushed on several occasions. The story kept me interested even if the characters didn't.

Puzzles are mainly inventory based though there are some logic puzzles. All are well integrated into the Egypt of the time. I managed to complete the game without resorting to a walkthrough, so they are on the easy side of difficult. Solving the puzzles gave a cut scene, nicely done.

Game length was disappointing. There are three venues, Akkad's garden, Royal library and Alexandria lighthouse. There are a couple of brief visits to Cleopatra's palace, but no significant gaming action takes place there. There is a system of choosing astrological sign which tailors the puzzles as easier or harder. In practice there is not much difference. The puzzles remain almost the same as does the length of the game. I estimate roughly 18 hours game play if you are as slow on the uptake as I am.

The game ran without problems on an older computer system. I liked what I saw, but wanted more for the price.",4.0
"Batman: Arkham City (AC) is a worthy sequel to its predecessor, Arkham Asylum.  In this game, you explore a city rather than a prison colony, and the controls are exactly the same.  The FreeFlow combat system is also similar, with the inclusion of new gadgets and double counters.

As far as the storyline goes, I found Arkham Asylum's story to be better on the whole.  In AC, I did not like Hugo Strange's role in the plot, as well as his collaboration with Ra's al-Ghul.  Joker is the main villain once again, and that's definitely not a bad thing.  I just felt that all the other villains detracted from the focus on Joker (disconnected plot lines were apparent).

Speaking of the villains, I'm glad that the designers decided to incorporate plenty of new bad guys in this game; however, I felt that a few of them weren't designed like they should be.  For example, the Penguin has this weird, cockneyed English accent when he really should be speaking with a nasal bird-like sound.  Also, his hands were not webbed at all.  For Mr. Freeze, he never spoke in a Germanic accent at all, although his robotic suit voice was pretty cool.

The Riddler was also never seen as a physical entity in the game, other than in projection form.  Supposedly, he appears in the flesh at the very end of a side mission when you collect all 400 (yes, FOUR HUNDRED) riddler achievements.  That's not good enough for me, though.  No way did I go around collecting all the riddler trophies and solving all the riddles.

Speaking of collectibles, there's a TON of stuff to find in this game, and I certainly didn't bother with collecting everything.  All I did was beat Batman and Catwoman's main storyline and called it a day.  All the other Riddler trophies, Riddler's Revenge, and side missions I found to be extraneous.  The other DLC (Robin & Nightwing) are completely useless and a waste of money, unless you're a trophy collector.

When you beat the main storyline, that's enough to have beaten the game entirely (in my opinion).  When I beat 100% of the main storyline, my total progress was only 36% (according to the game).  According to me, I was at 100%.  My other statistics at time of completion included:  16% side missions, 25% upgrades & collectibles, 13% Catwoman's collectibles, and no Riddler Challenges.  I didn't even bother with New Game + mode either.  In fact, playing the whole game on Normal difficulty was extremely hard.  The fights are very tough on that mode!

The Catwoman DLC package wasn't bad either.  Her main storyline revolved around her stolen goods with Two-Face.  As far as she is concerned, she wears these pinkish sunglasses on the top of her head, and I wished that she'd actually wear them on her face while you were playing.  You only see her put them on for 2 seconds at the very end of the game.  Such a cheap blow...  Also, her detective radar mode was very poorly designed.  You can't tell who's armed and who's not, which led to plenty of needless deaths.

Speaking of deaths, a major character dies at the end of the game.  If said character is indeed dead, how are they going to make another Batman game?  They'll have to either bring the character back, or never make another Batman game again.  And IF they do make another one, I hope it doesn't fall under the Call of Duty syndrome (i.e. same old story again).

Overall, I give Batman: Arkham City four stars (really 3.5, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt).  It's a 2011 Game of the Year nominee, but it never reached that iconic status this time around.",4.0

"I was one of those on the fence about buying this game, especially since a free version was in the mix for PS plus subscribers. But after finally deciding to buy it and playing it for what amounted to about 15 hours in the first two days, I am hooked. if you were alive long enough to remember arcades and classic systems like the original PlayStation, you will appreciate this simplicity in design with this game, yet the complex gameplay that it provides. Each car handles differently from the last and certain cars are better depending on what kind of race or mode you are playing. The controls are spot on and while simple to adjust to, will take some time to master.

What truly makes this game stand out, is its visuals. They are far above my expectations and that of any racing game that came before it. I play using a projector and 120"" screen, so graphical flaws generally slap me in the face if they are there. This game has zero. I don't see any aliasing and the texture work is just miles ahead of anything I've seen before. There are tracks that will take you 8 to 10 minutes to drive from beginning to end, that start in snowcapped mountains, take you through windswept fields and into the heart of a city. All while day turns to dusk and night falls, showing off the amazing realtime lighting. Everything meticulously crafted to look at is spot on real as possible. And even though this game operates at a locked, rock solid 30 frames per second, you would never know due too it's perfect use of object blur. Something that makes the game feel faster, yet keeps the backgrounds and roadway still looking sharp, colorful and clear. When they implement the weather effects, it will launch this game into the stratosphere visually.

The single player portion of this game is pure crack. I can't stop playing and when I do, I think about going back and playing again. Which is the sign of a truly great game. Evolution Studios has done what any developer sets out to do, Make their game fun. That is what this game is, if you take the game for what it is and don't think about what it could have been You and your friends will have an incredible time playing this title.

What is included in the game, is rock solid. The future of this game will be determined by the quality of DLC, which looks like it is going to continue to improve this title for the next year or so. The studio has been very quick to react to fans wants and needs, and I think if they continue to do that and add new tracks and some American vehicles They will have a hit on our hands, and turn some of those naysayers minds around.

So if you want to have some fun and enjoy a great arcade like racing experience, this is the game for you. If you're looking for Gran Turismo or Forza Racing( not Horizon), this probably isn't the game for you.",4.0

"Nostalgia gaming continues, with Atari Anthology dropping 85 games, mostly from the classic 2600 system on one disc.  Had hoped to see Superman on here, but there's enough classics to make up for those that were left out.  Keeping in mind that most of these games came out when video graphics were in their infancy, it's still a kick to play games like Adventure and Bowling, and hearing sound effects from 20+ years ago.

Good thing about playing on a modern system is not having to re-load cartridges a bunch of times until they work, though the vertical ""racing stripes"" and/or weird sounds caused by partially inserted or defective games in the 2600 were always good for a laugh. Main complaint would be that playing paddle-controller games just isn't the same with joysticks or d-pad controllers.  Recently released Atari classic console unit looks cool, but has less than half as many games, so go with more games for a lower price.",4.0

"Yeah, people say that this borrows from other games, and this is true to a large extent.  But I still found it rather fun and is a welcome releif from all the WWII and vietnam shooters I've ben playing.  The music is half decent reminiscent of what you would listen to in an action movie film like a Steven Segal flick (I never did turn off the music like I do in some games).  The game setting seems to be a mix of contemporary and city architecture.  I think the reason why the levels can be so boring is because the game level designers seemed to be more of an architect trying to capture what a building should be instead of a game level designer.  And we know that most buildings are rather boring in their layout in real life, hence the boring level designs.  Still, the game looks good, and the weapons are quite fun to play with and is mostly stable (I got stuck in a few levels, and also found some glitches where enemies could fire through doors and barrels).  The plot seems to be reminiscent of the movie ""Total Recall"".  The caviets that I didn't like about the game is that you need an internet patch to run this on XP SP2 (too bad for those out there that don't have internet access), and also the fact that sometimes you got stuck and didn't know where to go and had to look at the on-line guide to figure something that doesn't seem to be intuitive.",4.0

"I've been playing Skyrim on the PS3 for about two years.  I started getting in to Let's Play videos on You Tube and started to see all of the great mods people are creating for the PC version.  This led me to purchase the PC game last week.  I'm unfortunately playing on my wife's PC which has an underpowered graphics card.  Fortunately graphics cards seem to be cheaper than I remember so an upgrade is coming.  For now I'm playing in window mode which is good enough to get started.

This game is just about the only game I may ever need again.  I've done dozens of different characters and played hundreds of hours.  All of this playtime and I still find new things every time I play through.

Perhaps my favorite aspect of this game is the lore and history behind the story.  I've played Morrowind and Oblivion and loved them both.  I've played other RPGs and there have been good and bad but none seems to have such a cohesive and fully realized world developed around the game.

If there is one downside to playing on the PC versus the PS3 it's the controls.  I know almost everyone says playing on the PC offers better control but I miss the simplicity of the controller.  I am picking up the controls quickly but for now I'm playing on Adept because combat can get confusing and hectic.

There are also small little issues with the game that can frustrate me.  NPC lines can get a bit repetitive.  I'm a dog lover so having a dog along is fun but the constant barking gets annoying (as does accidently hitting the dog during combat and killing him).  All in all the issues are minor and nothing other games don't also suffer from.  I may not have played long enough to experience some of the glitches and crash issues others have had.  I had not previously had anything to do with Steam but the process was pretty fast and completely pain free.

The game has been around for quite some time so I don't know if there is anything I can really add to the conversation but if you are looking for a fun, deep game that independent modders are still creating new content for, this is a good one to get.

A little update, since I got the video card this game is even better.  I installed Bethesda's HD texture pack and it's no exagerastion to say it's improved the looks 100%.  Gameplay is much improved also.",4.0

My biggest problem with the after market controllers is the lack of longevity in the product.  This particular company seems to have made a decent controller that has some lasting power. A month in so far and seems to be holding up well. I will keep my fingers crossed & hope it keeps on working. Other than that...cool design with option to turn lights on or off.,4.0

"This being one of the few JRPGs on the PS3, I recommend it to any RPG fan who owns a PS3. The combat system is very unique and requires a bit more strategy than your traditional turn-based battle system. The storyline is very intriguing. Definitely worth a buy, especially at a low price.",4.0

"Continue from the 1997 FPS classic, The World is Not Enough was another solid 007 game that defined a good single-player experience and great multiplayer.

The story feels much better than GoldenEye with great voice acting and improve difficulty and objectives. Multiplayer remains the same as GE with new characters and weapons. The only minor flaw of this game that it requires a Controller Pack to save a memory file, which is very inconvenient to work properly.

TWINE 007 was a great N64 game, but GoldenEye remained on top in terms of multiplayer. A movie-license game done very well!",4.0
"King & Balloon, Bosconian, The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Buster, Grobda, Motos, and Rolling Thunder are neat little additions to Namco Museum's portable outings, but let's be completely honest here: You most likely got this collection because of the new four ""Arrangement"" games included. If you did buy this for your memories with the classics, including the ones I've mentioned above, then good for you! That's just more for you to enjoy. However, the Arrangement games are arguably the meat of the package, so let's focus on those for a little while.
Each Arrangement game is, unfortunately, not the mid-90s updates to their respective arcade classics, but instead they are all-new games that attempt to serve the same purpose. If you have an iOS device, you can buy these games individually for $3 each (Except for New Rally-X Arrangement, oddly, as it's not on the App Store) although they're labeled as Remixes instead of Arrangements for some reason.

Pac-Man Arrangement is a no-brainer - It takes the classic dot-munching, ghost-avoiding/chomping maze gameplay and expands upon it by giving the yellow blob multiple worlds and environments to travel through. The game is colorful and vibrant, and the mazes sometimes provide a small gimmick or two that would change how you would plan your way through. At the end of each world, you even ""battle"" a giant ghost boss that you must defeat by splitting it up into smaller ghosts and eating them. Perhaps the only major problem I have with this game is that the enemies hardly put up much of a fight. Even the regular ghosts you face as you go through levels move much slower than they did in the arcade hit, and the bosses are monotonous, as each boss follows the same format. It's just overall not a challenging game. It's otherwise a very fun game, but I just prefer the 1996 game of the same name (Which you can find in Pac-Man Collection for the Game Boy Advance, or Namco Museum for the Gamecube, PS2, and Xbox).

Galaga Arrangement doesn't quite revamp things to Pac-Man's extent, but it's still a nice variant of the shooter. This may not be your papa's Galaga, but he can still jump right in. There are only a couple major differences between this and the original, and those differences are the numerous new wave formations of aliens, and the boss battles you face at the end of each world, which do in fact put up a fight unlike  in Pac-Man. I just wish the double-firepower ability returned - Instead, you get a slightly stronger variation of your default gunfire. Compared to the 1996 Galaga Arrangement, this isn't bad, but I miss the extra little things the 1996 game offers (Including but not limited to rotating environments).

And now we head to the games that force me to dock off a star on this review.

New Rally-X Arrangement feels incredibly half-baked. It does nothing to add to the original game's formula other than subtle things like mud sliding (Which hardly ever affects your movement), and ramps your car jumps off to reach an opposing area. But by the time you reach the levels you finally use those things, you're probably already worn out. While the game doesn't really do anything to improve the mechanics of the original, it does provide some frustrating AI as time goes on. Don't be surprised if there are levels where you crash almost right after picking up a flag.
Just play the original New Rally-X, which is included here...

Dig Dug Arrangement fails to satisfy thanks to a similar problem. The enemies may not be any tougher than they were before, but the obstacles such as boulders move in illogical manners, such as SIDEWAYS at times. On top of that, Dig Dug himself is painfully slow. The last thing you can expect from this game is a solid pace.

Of course, this review can't be complete without providing an at least brief look over the arcade classics that are included in this robust compilation. Here we have games pulled from the Pac-Man series, Galaxian series, Rally-X series, and the list goes on. Like I mentioned way earlier, King & Balloon, Bosconian, The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Buster, Grobda, Motos, and Rolling Thunder are more obscure classics that are relatively new to the Namco Museum series, more-so the portable outings, and I'm glad Namco decided to include those. After all, it's a little tiring to obtain the same games as Namco Museum installments continue. I think I have enough versions of Pac-Man.
In terms of being a video game collection, Namco Museum Battle Collection is a must-have for PSP owners. If you are looking forward to the four Arrangement games featured here, just don't expect much from the latter half. They aren't worthy to be in this otherwise really great handheld compilation.",4.0

"I was uneasy about buying this game after reading all of the negative reviews. I hate to hurt any ones feeling, but this game run smoother than Battlefield 1942. If this will help any of you gamers, Here We go..... I running windows 98...with a 2.6ghz processor...Nvidia geforce Ti-4600 128 megs video card, sound blaster 512 sound card..... 512 megs of DDR rams for memory....2x...4x AGP.....52x cdrom,...400mhz frntside bus.........After I installed the game I changed the settings, as follows....... set resolution to= 800x600x16 bits...set sound=44 hzs....turned shadows and lightmap off....set graphics=medium..set bot level=14......If you will check out these settings,you might just get your game running better, I hope this help, Thank You Romeo H Faison. One more point, You gamers have got to remember, You have got to break a game in ,the same as you would break a new car in. The more you play the game the better it will problably run on your computer. One more thing ,right click on my computer, hit the performance tab, make sure the sytem resource is at least 93%.If it is under 90% ,Hit control,alt delete at the same time to see what is running in the background, play around with this a bit.,Shut down some of the programs that are running in the background,but make sure you do not shut down, system tray, and explorer. Somtimes there are programs running on your computer, that you may be unaware of , in this case go to the system configuration utility. , and hit the system startup tab, look at some of the programs running in the background, uncheck some of these programs,using some common sense, always leave system tray and etc;,Finally remember you have ,its a must ,play the game until you feel you have broken it in to your computer, Sometimes you can turn the game on high afterwards. P.S. I have never put a patch on this game, this is the only new game, that I have never patched, You can always set the resolution to 640x480x16 bits, its not going to change the graphics guality that much, it won""t be noticeable by any means. I have over a 100 games, I knows how to make a game work,play around with the # of bots, or soldiers in the game, when you get close to a tank you will problably, you will notice a slight dip in the framerate. One last point of interest,driving vehicles,flying planes,helicopter is best, if using a joystick, especially the tanks,inboth bf1942,and bfvietnam......PEACE:",4.0
"I never actually played the original Sonic Adventure until I was in my mid-late teens (this game came out when I was 4 or 5). I grew up on SADX on the gamecube. The game is almost exactly the same, but the different, more vivid textures make it seem like a more realistic environment while also giving it a sense of older fashion-sense days.

I'll skip the gameplay, since it's a very basic Sonic gameplay most people in the mid-Sonic times are familiar with. I'll definitely say it's a bit more slippery and bouncy, though, but that was probably to show off the major advantage the DreamCast had over the original PlayStation or the N64.

The chao garden in this game is easily the most far removed from the other 3 versions (in SA2, SA2B, and SADX). The others have cute, snuggly, happy chao whose lives are only miserable if your torture them. You know what you're doing with your chao and accidents are rare. Not the case in this game. Every chao is born as an adult, and will very quickly kill itself if you don't do something soon. Their movements, like most of the game, are very bouncy. I dare say this is the bounciest thing in any major-release game I've ever seen, actually. It's almost a high-speed environment with a visible difficulty level.

If you're looking for a sentimental chao garden, this better be your last buy. If you're only after something nostalgic or want to collect for SEGA fandom's sake, this is one you absolutely can't leave out.

I'd also like to mention that when this game was released, I didn't know about it until about 5 years later. At the time, I was into Sonic and Pokemon (when Kanto was the only region!), for the most part, and I thought the new art style was as cool as anything could ever be. I didn't recognize Knuckles, though, because I'd only ever seen AoStH and a few Sonic products in stores (such as spaghetti-os). I literally thought Knuckles was an enhanced-awesomeness version of Tails, since he was the only character on the can with Sonic. I completely forgot about that feeling until this showed up in the mail after I ordered it. The box art is just so much more detailed than any other Sonic game's that I can think of (regarding resolution, at least).

If you're just breezing through and want a Sonic game with good music or gameplay, this won't be close to the bottom of your list, but not the top, either. This is a casual buy if you're not collecting or shooting for nostalgia.",4.0

My son is 10 and loves most everything Lego.  He said that this was a good game but he bet it in less than a week.

"When it has came down to Luigi, he has only been known as one thing, Mario's sidekick when it comes down to fighting Bowser and rescuing Princess Toadstool away from the clutches of evil. But Luigi has once in awhile been known to have a escapade away from Mario. That showed a decade ago with Luigi's Mansion, the launch game for the Nintendo Gamecube back in 2001. The game was underrated but had maintained a steady cult following. But it has been a longtime since there has been a follow-up to the classic game. There was never a sequel to the game for the Nintendo Wii, instead the return comes to the Nintendo 3DS with Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. The question is for Luigi fans, is the game worth while. Well, it is a haunting yes and a fearful scare from Luigi himself.

Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon does deliver what fans of the original Nintendo Gamecube game wanted in a game. This time around Professor E-Gad is seeking help from Luigi as he is trying to study friendly ghosts during a eventful moon. But sadly, the moon and the ghosts get possessed by the devilish King Boo who takes control of the harvesting Dark Moon and Luigi gets to return on a ghost hunting spree. This time around Luigi has to use his puzzle solving skills and quests through 5 different mansions hunting different ghosts from traditional boos to ghosts spooks and dog ghosts. There are some new features as well like a multiplayer challenge called Scarescaper where you and your friends can go on a ghostbusting spree, and try to escape first to the bottom of the tower. Graphically, the game does stand up very well to the Gamecube original, and the sound and control of the game measure up nicely. Sadly though, there could have been more for the multiplayer action to draw more people in. There could've been a multiplayer in the main adventure to measure up to the game, like Luigi's past games with Mario. Still, it does measure up to the challenge for any single player action.

All in all, despite a few flaws Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is definitely worth playing from beginning to end. I have always found the original game to be challenging but fun to master. This time around, it definitely is up to the fun, especially for anyone that wants to scare up to the task. If you have played the Nintendo Gamecube game, you'll definitely be up to this scary good game. But for those who have never played the original game, might be uncomfortable with the ghost hunt. For them, I recommend you play the original Nintendo Gamecube title first, and see if you are up to the game. But for those that want to have a second haunt from King Boo, this would be one worth trying.

Graphics: B 1/2+

Sound: B

Control: B

Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ for single player; C+ for multiplayer

Overall: B 1/2-",4.0
"NBA Live always seems a step behind the competition, but when you start a franchise over from scratch, I really expected this game to be a few years in the making. While 16 is Still a work in progress I have to say, I have no regrets getting it this year. Live 15 was all right, had some bugs that I didn't like, but it thought it was fun and had some good moments. Live 16 is a good upgrade from 15 and at the very least, check out the demo and spend some time with it.  Demo has 6 teams too and you have access to a lot of features. The new ProAm mode is probably the beset part this year, 5 on 5 basketball online with no lag? Yup, it's fun!  Just look out for those hog balls! But get some friends, you got a party!

The core game has seen a big improvement from 15, the players can not be described as wonky or robotic anymore, I'm seeing a good flow and movement on the court. There's more depth than meets the eye. The shooting mechanics is pretty smooth this year, they added a new shot meter. My only complaint, is that the difficultly needs to be increased and varied for each player and by what difficulty level you're playing on, it's almost too easy to shoot with it and free throws almost seem automatic. But if you don't like it, all good, it can be disabled.

 The prostep/eurostep move is cool and you'll see some great animations when using this, but sometimes it seems overly powerful. I hope they address it in a patch. Players move around lively on the court, that's a beef the past Live games had, but they move and get open on this game. Calling plays is fun and I like the action. The post game works, but i feel with only one shot button, my moves in the post position are limited.

The A.I. needs work for the end game stuff. They just don't seem to make smart plays. Last game I was up 3 with 3 seconds left and they went for the quick 2 instead of tying the game for 3? Maybe hoping for a foul? It doesn't happen all the time, but their clock management is also in question. Truth b e told, you'll have much more fun playing with a friend. My friend and I played on the couch for 4 hours and we didn't want to stop. It's def better if you play with a friend. Online seems to work well, EA's servers have always been decent, so keep that in mind too.

Graphics are very very good.  This is where Live really never slacked anyway, but everything about this game is purty.  Up close the player detail is very well done. Nice looking face scans, details tattoos, accessories of all the players, socks, shoes. It's all well implemented!  The courts are extremely well detailed, shiny, great use of lighting, nice looking stadiums, reflections, animated crowds, team benches, coaches,  all looks really good. You even got scuff marks as the game progresses! Nice!

Any complaints here? Well, I do wish they had some more camera views, I want to be able to Zoom in and out, but the ones you have are acceptable, but more please.

Presentation is fantastic. Players show emotion, yes they show emotion in big moments! ESPN is splattered all over this game. Great stat screens, pre game, halftime and post game show. No complaints, actually I prefer the presentation over what 2k's game does. Also a decent soundtrack. NBA Rewind is back, and you can even go back to last years games for your team! And it's working! Also added a mode called """"Big Moments"" where you can relive classic moments and change history! Some are only 5 seconds, some 2 minutes, some full games, I find it pretty addicting playing through these games!

The game has been updated daily since day 1. A big patch was released on launch and had some tweaks and gameplay touches.  FG% seemed a bit too high before the patch, but things seemed to be smoothed out on the day1 update. The rosters seem pretty accurate and has some rookies and most of the players seem scanned accurately. They promise daily updates for gameplay tuning and roster changes and the use of Synergy (player tendencies)

One of my favorite modes is ProAm.  I'll tell, I'm never a fan of going online, always have problems with connecting, lag, people cheesing, what have you. But overall, I don't have much of that on this game. You basically take your created player online against other players, 5 on 5 and build up his skills to be amazing.  Sometimes you got like 2 humans with 3 cpu on one team, or 4 humans one cpu, just depends on the time of the day.  But 5 on 5 is a blast and it's smooth and plays well. Even better you can jump into a game within a minute and start playing. The net code must be great, because I have not had lag at all and playing with people who love b'ball, it's a blast. Occasionally you'll get those jerks who hog the ball, but not too bad. If you play a team, all your skill points is used to build up your player, and it's really really fun.

Big Moments is a nice addition. You take a control of 1 player in a past memorable game and they have hundreds of them. Relive history or change history by making the ultimate comeback or winning a big game in overtime with your favorite player. You can even search by team too, which is nice! I really think you will too.

NBA Rewind lets you play past games of any game in the season. Because it was acting up in 15, you can go back to last season and relive every game if you want with your favorite team. I think it's clear, this game is going to keep you busy

NBA Live 16 is not going to blow your socks off, but one thing Live does better, is that everything seems to work well, and online is fun and the modes are robust and will keep you busy. The game still needs work, but i think you'll like it. Check out the demo on your system for a trial run and work from there. I feel it to be a good second option and there's plenty to do to keep you busy all year. God bless everyone.",4.0
"I bought this mouse locally since I needed it quicker then waiting for it to ship. I replaced a SteelSeries Sensei Raw with this model. The raw had a glitchy scroll wheel. I like this one much better. It glides on my surface much easier (Roccat Taito Mid-Size Control Pad) and feels nicer in my hand. The braided cord is nice like my previous mouse.

I'm on a Mac so out of the box this mouse had low polling and was slow. I installed Razer Synapse software and I could change those settings quick.  I changed the color cycling to a white 'heartbeat' type pulsing.

My only gripe is that the Razer Synapse application required me to make a Razer account so I could log in. I couldn't simply install it and change settings. That's annoying. I'm docking a star for that.",4.0
"Let me first state this. I hate MMOs. I hate grinding. But i like Endgame
PvP and hate PvE.

The PvE PQ system is amazing but the mobs are all basically tank n spank and the AI is retardedly low.

The T1 RvR scenarios are decent. They are fun but bore quickly. They are basically all ""Hold the node"" games like Wow's EoTS without the flag.

The T2 RvR Scenarios are TERRIBLE. The capture the flag and hold the mountain games are basically the worst WSG matches all balled up into these scenarios. Huge turtles with no strategy or point but exactly that.. TURTLING. Remember how much you hated WSG turtles? Well here you have it.

There is no instanced PvE before level 20 that i saw. it was all ""PQ"".  The loot system is very fair and alot of fun.

The RvR scenario queues for Destruction are ridiculous. No instaqueue like WoW but you can queue from anywhere as long as you are in the zone(which sucks you have to fly and pay for flight each time). Or you can have a guildie connect to you.  I did not play order but if you want fast RvR do not play destruction. 30 minute waits? This is like WoW at its worst. I don't want to play 30 minutes to play a BG.

The World RvR is fun but its luster wears off. It's just a huge campfest. One sides pushes to a base, then gets beat back by guards. Then the other side pushes back and gets beat back by guards. It's a pointless TM/SS all over again. There really is no motivation to take a keep and noone is really caring or doing it yet.

But in the end this game is still a huge grind like WoW.  Mythic did not get away from the grind.  You HAVE to grind PQs to level up. There is simply NOT enough quests to just level and stay at your level. And the RvR queues and leveling is just so slow. They really needed cross server battlegrounds.

My recommendation: ""WAIT"".  This game is not finished and is still a grind. Wait until it gets good to waste your time. You're going to spend a good week of /played (Chinese farmers are saying it takes 10 days to get to 40).

I got 6 free days and i've quit. Why? It's a grind. I want a game that i can be max level and play and have fun. Not kill 10 wolves for 160 hours of my life before the game even starts. I am a PvP guy and waiting 30 minutes for a queue doesn't even cut it.

Also the kicker. If you crash(happened 6 times to me yesterday over 8 hours and have a Quad 2.8 with 8800GTX SLI system) YOu get booted to the back of the queue. You want to know how long i had to wait after 4pm? THIRTY MINUTES to play on my server.

So my advice is... Pick Order, Pick a low pop server with high pop destruction, or wait till they fxi it with x-server battlegrounds.

As of now if you like MMOs you will like it i'm sure. But if WoW was your first MMO its basically just a slightly improved WoW (PVE wise) with more crappy maps and LESS grinding, but still ALOT of grinding.",4.0
"Really enjoy using this for gaming and listening to music and whatnot. It has some nice quality and unlike my Logitech headset- it doesn't hurt my head after I use it for several hours at a time. But when I got my headset- I am pretty sure it arrived with a broken mic. I have had the headset for several months and I have yet to get the headset to work despite going through instructions- it simply won't pick up any sound whatsoever. The headset also used to make an annoying buzzing sound- but I think after hitting the volume switch a few times and messing around with it- the buzzing has finally stopped and has not came back since... good think too because that was consistent and happened for about a month. I do enjoy the headset but my advice to the seller is to double check your equipment and make sure it is 100% fully functional before shipping it out to your buyers. I would have rated this 5 stars had my headset arrived 100% functional without me having to mess around with the ""buzzing"" noises and the mic is fully broken- I can't do anything about that. Aside from those issues, I really do enjoy the headset and I did get it primarily as a listening device instead of for communication.",4.0

"I spent TOO MUCH TIME fishing in this game. And camping/eating. Would have liked more in-game lore though: the hunts felt a little bland because of this (compare them to FFXII hunts that had you talk to different NPCs and get their motivations and backgrounds as to what the beasts were, and why they wanted them dead). I ended up not understanding or being as invested in the world as I was in other Final Fantasy games, which led to the fights that were supposed to be epic and meaningful just falling kinda flat for me. Which is a shame because this game is gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing.

That said the main cast, chocobros, whatever you call them... are incredible. I just wanted to spend as much time with them as I could. I loved the dynamic, the sometimes corny dialogue and awkward jokes, the awesome dialogue and funny jokes - I just loved it. And I cried shamelessly at the ending.

All in all, I love this game. Not the strongest in the franchise, but a solid addition.",4.0
"My brother in law an I where looking for an fun multiplayer game, and we pick Dead Island, is a great game to play with your friends, up to 4 players coop, the maps are very large and open for you  to explore.

You will be finding lots weapons most of them meele and blunt, with some firearms but be wise in their use, ammo is not common in this game.

sometimes you will find yourself with a problem on choosing the weapons for you to keep, and the inventory gets full very quick hehehehe

there are tons of quest, some for the main story and lots side and recurring (gathering) quest, and will keep you busy running from point ot point, thanks god there is a well implemented fast travel system :)

So if you like the zombie theme in a fps/rpg game, this is the game for you.",4.0
"I really liked 2010's Hot Pursuit game, but it had some issues that kept me from loving it. While the game presented itself as a large open map, you were limited to individual races one at a time. The career focused far too much on dull time trials and not enough on the exciting car chases. NFS Rivals is EA's second crack at this formula and has resolved both of these issues, delivering what I think is an excellent game.

The split between cop and racer is back, but it's a little more open this game. Each level gives you a series of goals to pursue, such as getting N gold medal or taking down X racers. You can choose the goals for each level which opens it up a bit. There are the same time trials as before (complete with the annoying time penalties, although they're not as annoying as before) but a lot more pursuits and races and takedowns.

Rivals integrates multiplayer much more deeply than before, but take it or leave it - I was never a fan on Hot Pursuit. They threw in the speed zones from Most Wanted. You can now play the game with people, similar to Test Drive Unlimited back in the day, but I've had limited success connecting to games.

This game makes a great and underrated demo to show off your new XO (or PS4). It's running in EA's new Frostbite engine and has that deep, saturated, detailed look of Battlefield. It really looks great. It is, also, to my eyes, running at a full 1080p with a stable framerate. It sounds great too.

Overall - if you like Hot Pursuit you really should get this game. EA made some smart improvements to an already good formula and turned up with a winning game.",4.0
"I try to keep this brief and to the point.
First I LOVE this game.  I was getting totally bored with Company of Heroes, my buddies and I had sort of mastered Company of Heroes and the only thrill was the point about  into the game were the tide might (just might) change and make it a little more difficult to win.  Don't get me wrong COH is a great game but for me the time had come to move on.
Enter MOW and I fell in love.  First off, it does require micromanagement.  Sometimes the controls can be a little wacked, sometimes the AI doesn't do what you want it to do.
JOYS:
ability to steal stuff of dead guys and use it.
ability to use opponent resources against them (hijacked tanks and other vechiles)

sound effects - when your machine gunner opens up on a crowd of bad guys and you here the drum beat of the gun and the bullets ripping through flesh and walls and ...

Graphics - I am playing on a high end machine and OMG it is eye candy heaven.  Explosions that will have you saying ""That was so cool!!!"" and it was your own stuff exploding.
Load times - this game appears to have a LOT more going on with it than most other RTS in terms of physics but it loads up extremely fast.  And shuts down extremely fast
Stability - I am running on high end Vista 64bit and ... I am trying to think... it has never crashed on me... never had a problem with the game.
OK now the BAD Stuff
CONS:
Voice Acting is really really really bad.  But this is such a minor point for when comparing it game play value and it is only during the cutscene where it is really bad, in game it not bad at all.
Multiplayer - once you in a game it is cool.  But it is a pain in the butt to buddy up with people.  I wish the Multiplayer lobby was a little cleaner and easier to manage.
Single player is Brutal - I mean brutal even on easy, you are going to get your ass handed to you.  Some levels you are there is just a stream of bad guys - they just keep coming and coming and coming.  It gets a little frustrating but when you do accomplish the mission it is rather rewarding to know you `finally' beat that level.
TIPS:
Allowing your team to move at the own will, they will move - sometimes not where you want them to go.  So use hold move.  I usually use free move when I have them running across the map, this way if they see any bad guys they will open fire but once there, I switch to hold move.
Sometimes it is better not to fire and stay hidden.
Don't forget to grab ammo and health packs off dead guys - nothing worse than getting into a firefight and realizing your guys are firing because they don't have any bang bangs.
Wishes:
They had a skirmish mode where you could play the computer on equal terms
Hope this helps - Oh there is a demo for the game, so be sure to check out the demo before you throw down you hard earn cash to see if you like the micromanagement aspect of it.  For the voice acting just turn down the volume during the cut scenes ;)",4.0
"I'm new to this franchise and I've not played games on PC in decades. Let me start by saying, I love strategy board games. I was very eager to get Civilization 6 when it was released, but my laptop didn't fit the spec requirement for this game. I finally took a plunge and bought this game anyway. To my surprise, it is working fine so far even though I don't have a video card ram that this game requires. If you are on the fence because of the same reason, you may want to reconsider.

I've only played this game for 3 hour and mostly i'm still at the stage of understanding basics of this game. It is a complex game and if you are new to this franchise, you will most likely have to read or watch some tutorial. So far, I find this game entertaining. I truly enjoy the various moving pieces. It takes time to understand what strategy you might employ. It is too early for me to comment on the AI part of this game and i've no intention to play this game in multiplayer mode as my gaming habits are rather erratic and I don't have luxury to play this game uninterrupted for hours. I don't find the game graphics cartoonish as others have commented and i like the flow of the game. It is rather slow as compared to other open world strategy games but it is a turn-base game.

I intend to update my review but as of now, I see alot of potential and would recommend this game.",4.0
"Bought this from Gamestop for PC

Docking two stars because the disc only installed 20% of the game, now I have to download the remaining 16GB on a connection that only gets download speeds of 240 Kb/s.

I'll be able to comment on the gameplay tomorrow once it FINALLY downloads AND updates.

Thanks Bethesda........

Update:

Added a star because this game has really awesome gameplay, graphics, customization, etc.  I still dock a star because of the download, and also because of some glitches and other issues which I hope Bethesda will get around to fixing:

- The game will sometimes minimize for no reason (Windows 64 bit).  I am not hitting my windows key, my keyboard has a switch to turn those keys off so I don't accidentally minimize myself.  When it does minimize, there is a slight chance that when you restore to full screen, your computer will lock up and you will be forced to turn the computer off and back on at the power button.

- Sometimes when I rapidly change weapons on a hotkey, the graphic disappears along with the crosshairs and I have to go into third person and back to first person to restore it.  I try to change my weapons before a fight (I have high sneak) based on how I feel the fight will turn out so then I can correct that bug beforehand.

- I'm bilingual, so I chose to play the game in Spanish.  I find it annoying that Bethesda chose not to translate names that could easily be translated i.e. Diamond City (should be referred to as Ciudad Diamante), or Minutemen (there's no literal translation in Spanish, but the closest could be Los Milicianos or The Militiamen).  But that's me, I'm a stickler for 100% accurate translations and I have criticized many companies in the past (mainly Blizzard) for that.

- Also sometimes the ghouls bug out and start running around you, into walls, or up ruined buildings and jumping off and repeating, pretty humorous at times.

But all in all I recommend this game, and I might go to five stars if Bethesda addresses the kinks in later patches.  Just Bethesda...STOP the minimizing in the game! PLEASE!",4.0

"If I had to put a complaint about this product, it would be that the top half of the case can be difficult to put on correctly at times. I don't really use the second half all the time though. I only use the grip when I play Monster Hunter 4 for any session over an hour long. My hands can cramp at times and it's just uncomfortable playing that game at times. I would definitely recommend this grip to anyone who has cramped hands from playing on their 3ds for too long.",4.0

"Final Fantasy 3 is unique in a number a ways,it was the first game to introduce a job system,it was the first fully remade FF. The list can go on,now you may be wondering why I called this a good Final Fantasy and not something more extravagant,well I'll go into that a bit later,for now lets focus on a few other things.

Graphics: The first thing you'll notice as soon as you get past the nice CG opening is that this FF has been brought into full 3D,this is a huge step up from the 8-bit NES graphics of the early '90s. I did notice some slowdown on a few places on the world map,I doubt its because FF3 pushes the DS,but rather its a fault on Square Enixs side. The graphics will look dated when you compare it to FF4,but for a DS game it holds up nicely.

Your probably thinking,""I can't find a single English copy of FF3 for the NES,why is that?"" -Final Fantasy 3 was never brought to NA in the '90s,the NDS remake is FF3's first appearance in NA. (Although you can now get a fully translated FF3 on the Wii)

Gameplay:Gameplay wise this is classic FF style,gone is the ATB,now its just real turn based combat,your characters attack according to who has the better stats,your characters can also be superseded by monsters with better stats. Think of this battle system like FF10's and its not to far from the mark,although if your equipment is lacking or your not in the right job,the bosses will mop the floor with you. A good idea at the start of the game would be to make everyone a Red Mage,and then branch out from there once magic less of a concern.

One thing Square Enix did with FF3 was balance out the Job system,in the old version,all jobs except the 2 special once became useless near the end of the game,SE fixed this by making jobs much stronger then they once were. Nice touch if you like a particular job.

Story:This is why FF3 is only a 'good' FF,the story is somewhat primitive in the character department and reverts back to FF1 in that sense (FF2 had way more character development and a better story all around),SE did add character names and unique looks for each character as well as some back story to each one,but it just doesn't help much,FF3 feels very FF1-ish with different map layout and monsters.

Don't let that shy you away from this game though,it was only my opinion and I'm more of a guy who likes a game with great story (as well as lots of dialogue :D) so I'm a bit biased towards games with little story. Overall this game is cheap to buy now,so give it a try! (Tip:If you think this FF is going to be to hard,if you played FF4 DS and made it 20+hours or beat it,this game will seem like a cake walk,guaranteed!)",4.0

"I liked this game, but at times, it got frustrating enough for me to consult online walkthroughs for help. The special tools seemed awkward to use at points and it seemed difficult to see what you needed to find (scenes too dark). A little too heavy on the occult, but I suppose that should be expected considering the title.",4.0
"I do not play FPS games, however I do own a PS4 and since there are not too many games out there for the console right now I figured I'd give a few of them a try. As devout follower of the cult of science fiction, the first thing that caught my attention was the magnificent graphics and incredible environments. As far as video games go, I have never before seen anything like this. And on a big TV with a loud surround system it truly makes you feel like you have been transported somewhere else in time. As far as the gameplay goes, since I am not an expert in this genre all I have to say is this, the game was fun but certainly could have been a bit more exciting, I liked the use of the OWL but other combat mechanics felt a bit lacking to me. Overall I would recommend this game if for nothing else but the overall look and feel.",4.0
"This game is a great way to spend an afternoon. You start off with a mystery, only to realize as you travel that each mystery has a link to a bigger mystery. If you think you can just speed through this, you will die. Clues and items needed to get items to get to clues are hidden and you have to figure out how to use them. Different keys open different doors and there's plenty to explore, but not so much that you throw in the controller. I found some of the puzzles to be confusing; you have to reset pipes so that no water leaks and each pipe moves another...No help from the rest of the gang. I think the fact that 100 Frights was more difficult made people see this as they did. It won't take a college age person longer than an hour or two in the afternoon, but it's worth a rent -or buy if the price is down.",4.0

"Its hard to believe no one knew this was on the Genesis, not as good as the SNES version, but still good nonetheless.  All the best levels from the SNES and Genesis version (But still only six stages), all the great weapons are back but did Konami really feel they needed to up the difficulty level? I mean the first one was already Hard enough.
As mentioned, the best levels from Genesis and SNES are there, and its all in its glory.  First of all, the game is still fun.  the game also has six levels of pure difficulty with the same hard bosses as before.  Some bosses have even been made harder! Also, you can link up and play with a friend if you want.
Now the bad...the music is good but coming out of the small GBA speakers it isn't as good as the SNES version. Also, as I said, Konami decided to up the difficulty level.  Now, instead of carrying two different weapons you can only carry one weapon at a time.  Even if all the great weapons have returned, you can only carry one instead of two.  Second, because of the GBA's screen I suffered from a lot of cheap deaths that could've been avoided, and even though fun, playing as two players is still a little frustrating especially when all these cheap deaths are involved.
Overall this is a good game and a great re-release, but when they say Extreme you sure as hell better believe it.
On the good side
+Still has a good level of difficulty
+Updated graphics
+Combination of the best SNES and Genesis levels
+All those wonderful weapons return
But as with the pros come the cons
-Konami felt the need to make the game HARDER then it was!
-You can only carry one weapon at a time
-Some cheap deaths that could be avoided
The game is still great to play, but it isn't nearly as good as it was those years before",4.0
"I recently played the demo of this and liked it so much i bought Age of Empires 2 and the Expansion. The new civilizations and new stuff make the game even better than it was. After playing this for a week or two i went back to playing Starcraft and found it a little boring compared to this. The most addictive part of this game is building up over the different time periods. I only have two very small problems with this game, that if they were improved would make this the greatest game. Problem #1 the AI opponent in random games gives up way too easy and resigns way too quick from a battle. After spending an hour or two building up you don't want the climax up the fight to end in a resign in five minutes. It's like a great movie with a horrible ending. I want to completely demolish every little building of the enemy's till nothing of thiers exists on the map at all. This is still a great game can't wait to see what the next Age of Empires brings. The only other minor thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the different civilizations are still way too much alike, i wish they were just a bit more unique, more unique weapons, armies, buildings, etc..would be great. This game is completely addicting, and the expansion just greatly improves on that. Matter of fact once you've played the expansion there's really no going back to playing without it.",4.0
"I'm a huge fan of RP games, and review a ton of them...  Atfirst glance, this game seems like a rip-off of many other games outthere. Diablo or Baldur's Gate, anyone?
What original ideas. You can be a warrior, conjurer or wizard. You come from Earth, you're sent into another dimension where you are the Only Hope. Even worse, you're a male from a Florida trailer park whose idea of fun is crushing beer cans against his forehead while rebuilding truck engines. Let's talk about the anti-good-gaming ideal.
However, when you start up the game, the graphics amaze you. The whole sparkling mouse, the smooth graphics on all the select screens, and then the game play graphics. Simply amazing. Barrels are not just background decoration, they are all discreet individual objects.  Rocks, skulls, you name it - all individual objects that can be moved around.
The enemies all have personalities. The three factions all have distinct reasons for existing, and are in conflict with each other. The comments are humorous and the individuals have personality. I suppose at times the coders can overcome even the most inane marketers when it comes to game design.
The spells are great!  The conjurer, my favorite character type, has a Pixie Swarm to help defend him, and can have various creatures hang out with him as sort of a roving company of friends. I like the wolves and spiders myself, but you can acquire just about any enemy out there to hang out with you and help protect you.
The training levels are easy to get the hang of. I dislike the cone-of-vision, because even if you were just in a room, you suddenly forget where everything is in it - even the walls - and have to visit again to make sure you didn't miss anything. If you swing by a room, it draws it as a complete room, so it's difficult to tell from maps where you have been and where you have just passed by.
Also, save games are limited and you can't describe them at all. They simply list the character name and actual time - making it quite difficult for a multi-gamer household like mine to keep characters separated!
There are other minor bugs - icons don't consistantly draw in, and multi-player bugs are slightly annoying. The game itself is WAY too short when played in single player mode. Multi-player gets old really quickly, as you run around trying to kill each other over and over again. How about cooperative quests, like in BG?
In general though, the graphics and gameplay on this game are quite better than I had expected from a game that touted male-only characters. If only they had put a bit of effort into thinking about the people playing this game, and what they would want to play! I would have rated this game extremely highly, instead of only reasonably high. Worth renting to play through, but not a keeper.",4.0

"Sure, it's another Mario sports game.  My biggest appreciation is that these games appeal to both genders.  (Guys typically like the competitive elements and the trash-talking opportunities, and the girls typically like the cute little characters and sounds.)

As an avid lover of sports, but especially baseball and football (American), I found Mario Superstar Baseball to be a blast.  I've played it in the ""Story Mode"" (one player), and I've had an awesome time playing it with friends of mine.

The women I know who have played the game prefer the Story Mode because if we go up against each other, I'm throwing off-speed pitches in deep counts, getting them to strike out.  I also rub it in their nose.  So they prefer to play when I am not there since I never go easy on them.

But when I play against my guy friends, all the feel of the Mario games is present: great controls, great features, the Mario World, and above all else, variety.

What makes the variety so wonderful in these Mario games is the ability to unlock characters who have unique abilities.  After you go through the motions to unlock them, you can't wait to use them in a game.  And it is nice to have such great balance and variety because then you don't have to argue with your friend over who gets which players on whose team.

In terms of sheer baseball, Mario Superstar Baseball has it all.  I read reviews here defaming the controls and the ease of fielding.  If you have played most baseball video games, you will see that MSB actually ranks pretty high in controllability.  It is easy to find the ball in the outfield (the computer switches your active player for you and even camps you under the ball to make a play).  If you have a good head for the game of baseball, MSB won't let you down at all.  I also think that about most of the Mario sports titles: if you understand the game you are playing, the Mario World video game style will provide a different way to make it fun.

So to close, if you don't like baseball, don't buy Mario Superstar Baseball just to see Mario and his cute friends with gloves and bats - you won't like it.  If you love baseball, competition, AND the Mario World theme, this game rocks, and I recommend it for anybody, all ages.",4.0

"OK, like everyone says, the graphics engine is the best out there -- the lighting from the flashlight and all the ambient lighting from the swinging lamps, flashing red alert sirens, etc, are unbelievable.

My only problem was that the gameplay of the monsters coming at you turned a bit predictable after a while. Comparing this to Halo, for example, I enjoyed halo more in the sense that each monster acted drastically different, and there are ""puzzles"" in halo like having to figure out that those certain larva creatures will explode on your shields.

I found one specific part of the game to be excellent -- because the monsters are coming at you so much for a while, there is a roughly 10 minute portion in the middle where things calm down, BUT you are still on edge waiting for something to happen! Good scripting with that.

So, the game is great, but don't expect it to be everything you want and you will enjoy it more I suspect.",4.0
"These are pretty great for a PS4 head seat. The mic works well, the audio is satisfactory and I LOVE that it comes with its own rechargeable powered amp!

I found the surround sound effect to work well for first person shooters where surround sound makes an important strategic difference in game play (knowing where enemies are).

However, these aren't audiophile-quality headphones by any means (they're good, but not great) and, in fact, I found volume to be a little quiet at the loudest setting unless I was using the battery powered ""super human hearing"" amp.

Nevertheless, if you want a good value in gaming headset and don't mind not having thumping, impactful bass and crystal-clear audio, this is a great set of headphones to buy!",4.0
It took more than a week to deliver this game to my house. The game comes from UK. The game is good but it is old. don't expect state of the art  graphics.  It is a good and long RPG.

"I have just finally got around to getting this game. I have been a serious MK fan since the first one was in arcades. Sill have the SNES & Genesis MK's. Still got the Sega Saturn & PS one's too! I have been a little on the fence about some of the MK's that have came out since the Dreamcast days. Deception & a few others were pretty cool. Yet I just felt they weren't as good as the first 3 (and Ultimate 3 & Trilogy). MK vs DC didn't grasp my attention that much. And so when this game came out I was pretty excited! I didn't wanna shell out $59.99 when it first dropped....So I waited and have been playing it quiet a bit since just yesterday. It's a overall great game! It's challenging for sure, and though I still favor the more realistic characters & levels of the first 3, the graphics are awesome! The controllers are pretty good. They seem to have altered some of the controls for doing a characters moves & combos. The game has a good amount of characters to choose from (especially this Komplete Edition) this version has extras. Including 4 extra characters one of which is Freddy Krueger. Kinda weird seeing & playing as him in the MK world, but I'm definitely down! You also get to play as Sektor & Cyrax when they we're human. It's pretty cool, though in my opinion I like playing them as the cyborgs/robots in this. The game has the features of detail that fighters haven't had in games before. As you fight, your body & clothing show wear & tear. You get gashes,ect....And parts of your clothing get ripped and can be missing parts of it. The levels are well designed. And it apprears they all have a level fatality.  The sound is great both in it's tracks & sound effects! There are several ways to play this game. With friends/siblings in vs mode, or with different challenges & story mode. If you've been a overall big fan of the franchise like myself. I'd highly recommend this game to you! Or, if your fairly new to the MK series this is a great one to get into! And if you are among the new to series statistic....I recommend visiting the older games of this franchise. In my opinion the first 3 (+ Ultimate 3 & Trilogy) are still the best of the MK's to this day! But like I said, this is a overall great addition to the series. And the best one they have made in years!",4.0
"I bought this game a week before it hit store shelves so I've had time to play it enough to know what I'm talking about. The graphics are done really well, the environements are outstanding, character design is good the only downfall I noticed with the graphics is facial expressions are very plain and lifeless. There is alot of adventuring to keep you busy for hours,plenty of side quests along with a good main plot. Eventually in the game you will gain the ability to summon and take control of dragons. There are some things that bug me about the game and one of the is the cross hair mechanics, you guide this little circle around to people you want to talk to, or search boxes and such  and press the LB button. That gets annoying sometimes because people move around alot and it is sometimes frustrating to pin point them and most things you search are so close together that you miss alot of stuff. The difficulty could be a problem for some people to, beware of large groups of enemies, save often because nothing is more annoying then dying 2-3 hours into the game and having to start over from your last save. Besides the little problems I've had with the game are nothing compared to the fun I've had adventuring through what I've noticed to be a very large, adventerous game and if you are looking for a good rpg than ignore the bad reviews and get this game.",4.0

"{Edit: After finishing the game I reduce my rating to a 2. Look up Brad777's rating under 1 star. He sums up the problems with this game. Unlike the other FEAR's it has no replay value.}

Let me first say that I'll be first in line to bash SecuRom and I refuse to purchase a game with it. Steam I have actually come to like: no need to have a disc in the drive and it's nice being able to reinstall the game directly from Steam and not have to dig out my box of discs. Also makes for a quicker reinstall.

On to the game play. I just finished replaying the 3 previous FEAR games, and I must admit that I am a little disappointed so far with F2. Hopefully, it's just a learning curve.

Cons (most are minor):
- no saves or quick saves - my biggest gripe. The game seems to have secret checkpoints along the way. It would be nice to at least know when you pass one.
- I hate reading files and you pick up a lot early in the game.
- no lean, but I can do without.
- they remapped the E and F keys from earlier Fears. It's logical, but I keep hitting the F key to open a door and my flashlight goes on. I'll eventually catch on.
- graphics are strange. It's grainy, like you're in a haze. Not sharp like the early Fear. It also seems to have a narrower field of view.
- cut scenes between levels are too long.
- certain menu commands require hitting the spacebar or enter key instead of a mouse click. I thought that went out in the '90's.

Pros:
- no SecuRom.
- simple enough even an old guy like me can play and enjoy.
- you get to walk thru buildings and streets and kill things.",4.0

I honestly felt invested in some of the characters, much better story than previous battlefields. Multiplayer is great! I did give it only 4 stars because although multiplayer is great, the weapons selection is insanely small compared to other battlefields.  I understand part of that is due to the time period,  but I'm willing to give up a little bit of realism for a few more weapons with sights. Overall, I definitely think it's worth the purchase.",4.0

"I wasn't that all excited by the demo.  However, having played the full game, I find myself really enjoying it.  Now, that's not to say that the game is perfec.

Bad:
1.  as much as i do like the new physics engine, it does make for some odd behavior from the players.  For example, i was playing as the jaguars and justin blackmon caught a pass streaking down the sideline, with the defender almost right on top of him.  When blackmon keeps on running towards the end zone, his left arm was behind him resting on the should of the defender.
1a.  also, when the players are tackled, they stand up, only to fall again as they are getting back up as they trip on the guy they just tackled.
2.  i could be wrong, but i think they took out the october breat cancer awareness in october where the players would wear pink sneakers or the pink ribbon on the field, or pink gloves.  ]
3.  even though they are loads better than cris collingsworth, the play by play can get a little repetitive at times.
3.  it's not a huge deal, but i wish it could give you a score tracker for other games going on the same time you are playing, like with this years ncaa football.
3a.  I also wish that they would also make stats for the computers' teams be equivalent to the time of quarters that you play with.  For example, i play six minute quarters, but the computers' stats are for 15 minute quarters.
4.  If i challenge a call, please wait until AFTER the reg makes the call aobut the rep
lay.  It's annoying to hear the crowd boo right after the ref says the call on......(the field has been overturned)  It's messed up in that they already know if they are going to overturn or confirm before the ref even states that the outcome of the challenge.
5.  The starting screen is extremely cluttered and it was difficult to find which one you had to go to to play a game.
6.  when you line up to kick the ball, other than a punt, you have to press RT.  Now, this isn't bad on PAT, but if i am going to kick a 50 yard field goal, i'd like to see how i am aiming the arrow.  at least make it an option which way you want it.
7.  on a similar note, I wish i could turn off the play art. (again, this might be possible, i simply haven't found it yet.)

Good:
1.  the uniforms and the graphics are even better than last years, and they have added more shots to the game, for example, even if you are playing in a dome, after the game, it sill give you a blimp view, and you can see that it is raining, along with cars in a parking lot, and other small stuff like that.
2.  I might be a minority here, but i like the ability to use the kinect, but out of habit, i still mainly use the controller buttons (if you say that this cheapens the game, 2k sports nba is incorporating kinect verbal commands too)

there are more good things that what I posted, and i'm not going to say, ""this sucks"" and not give any reasons.  I wish that they would make it to where you hit an official on the field, he slows you down, instead of you going through the official.
I also wish that they would bring back the the chain gang coming out to measure if you got a first down or not.  I sort of miss being able to bean a guy on the other team for an unsportsmanlike penalty.",4.0
"Dissidia is basically like playing an anime version of chess.  You have to make the right move or either you'll set off a chain reaction(which isn't bad, but it gets annoying from time to time.) or you'll run out of DP's(Destruction Points).  Which in my case is bad when you get thru the stage and get your results.  You also get to equip a lot of cool stuff that'll help you in battle and exspecially when fighting Chaos.
Dissdia has all of your all time favorite characters starting from 1 all the way to 10.  It's a very exciting game and I was happy when I got this.  You can do a lot of things in here like...hmmm...fighting against a ghost character, or playing in wifi mode with friends and trade in friend cards so that your friends can challenge you and you recieve Moogle mail from of course the Moogles.  You can either fight in Casual or Hard mode.  You also have the villians from in here.  Like Golbez, Kelfka, Kuja and our all time favorite...Sephiroth!  It's a really neat game with lots of challenges and themes.  Basically to put it short, you can either choose Cosmos; The Goddess of Harmoney, or Chaos; The God of Discord.  Which team will you pick?  Good or evil?  Lol!
And once you play with your own character, they'll have their own theme to the stage their in.
I don't care what people think about this game.  If you are a total FF nerd like me then it shouldn't matter.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I like awesome grafics in games and wonderful fighting styles.  I mean, c'mon, you're talking to a girl who still plays Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  But you have totally got to get this.  If you don't like it, sorry.  But for some, you'll love it.",4.0
"This latest installment of the MG series is a big improvement over past releases.  The game looks beautiful on Xbox One.  I also appreciated the ton of back story content they provided.

They made several tweaks to make the game play more realistic and immersive.  Gone is the invisibility suit and alert meter.  These are replaced with more realistic features such as a spot light lens flare indicating a guard in the watch tower is looking your way; the radio chatter indicating they are in alert status; hiding in the shadows or bushes.

There is an iPad app (also one for Android) that turns your iPad into an extension of the game.  My favorite feature is the ability to bring up the game map which has all the features of the map inside the game itself, see where you are, mark targets, etc.  It's as if the Xbox One has it's own version of the Wii U game pad.

Some complain about the length, while this is a legitimate complaint I think it has to do more with how much you pay for the game.  I got it for $20, free shipping and no tax via an on-line auction.  I noticed Amazon sells in new for as low as $22.  At around $20-25 this game is definitely worth it.  Additionally while the main mission is only two hours you get another two hours or so of side missions.  They all take place on the same map but they all have different objectives and approaches.

While short this is a game I was not in a hurry to rush through.  I have gotten well over 10 hours of game play and plan to do more.  It's like games of old where we would play the heck out of them over and over again caused we loved them that much.",4.0

"The gameplay is terrific and running a franchise is fun.  Online modes are glitchy and laggy and they inexplicably removed the ability to play am online exhibition against a friend with real mlb teams.

Player faces and most uniforms look spot on and you can even upload your own music to play when batters come up to bat or when specific things happen during a game.

Controls are good but mostly unchanged from last year.  Pitching interfaces are a little dated and don't compare to the old 2k sports anolog pitching, though The Show is a much better game overall.

Batting stances look great and a lot of work has clearly been done on pitching motions, though there are some - like Masahiro Tanaka and Adam Wainwright - that look downright terrible.

They removed the HR celebration camera toggle, meaning its always on, which takes you out of  the game in big moments.. They should add that back in.

They have added career stats though they don't track minor league stats which is dumb because you can't see if a player is progressing.

All in all a fun game.",4.0

"Super Mario All-Stars is quite a bargain! You get Mario 1, 2, 3, and Lost Levels (Super Mario 2 Japan) on one cart with updated graphics and a really much appreciated save function! The save function really comes in handy with Mario 2, 3 and Lost Levels. Super Mario 3 really shines here and I have to admit it's the one I've played the most. Lost Levels wasn't released in the states until this game for a very good reason: It's way too hard for most players! I've only attempted to play through it twice before giving up.

"Believe it or not, I have never bought one of the previous version of this game till now. So I got to experience the game without the nostalgia that some may feel.

To begin, I have played ffvii through ffx-2 (skip ffix though I bought the game), so I am a fan of the series. I don't get to play with my console much these days, and gave away my Gameboy SP when I got my PSP. I always find time to play the PSP for some reason.

So here it is what I thought:

Gameplay: very basic rpg combat: pull the menu, choose attack (if character is melee) or choose magic ( if the character is mage). Of course this is the remake of the original game 20 years ago that went on to be successful. It was a defining game of JRPGs at the time. So combat is 20 years old. There are no summonings as in later FFs, or break limits (if you play FFs game you know what I am talking about).

I found the leveling pace to be easy, I never had a party wipe out and all bosses went down easy enough. In the original, 50 levels was the maximum and it was tough to get there, making the game difficult in the orginal NES version. In the PSP version, I got to break level 51 (50 is not the maximum level anymore) just before I faced the final boss.

I clocked 20 hours from beginning to final boss. I read claims that it is an 8 hours game. My guess, is that the PSP version has upped the random encounter rate. That may explain why it was easy to get level 50. Most random encounters had monster that would died with one hit (on the first turn), those that didn't, died in the second turn.

Story: Story is very lacking. Four warriors come out of nowhere to restore some crystals. There is no hero interaction, party interaction, no character growth, no anger, revenge story, love story, etc, all the drama that you have seen on the sequels.

If it did not carry the FF franchise name,and knew the 20 year history behind this game, I would have given it a 3 star rating. But, it gets an extra star because without this game, there would not have been all of the other JRPGs that we have come to love and consume.",4.0
"My girl loves it. That's pretty much all that matters! I am a gamer and I have been trying to drag my girl into the gaming world for a long time, but me being a Playstation fan and a hardcore gamer as well, for her my games are way to complicated and difficult to play, so I bought her a Nintendo DS XL and even when at first she didn't pay much attention now she is a real addict playing this little game! And guess what? she now has her own PSN ID and plays games such as Critter Crunch, Start the Party, Singstar Dance, and some other PSN games! I couldn't be more happy and it is all thanks to this awesome games! Cooking Mama turned my already cute girl into a cute Gamer Girl (is like a unicorn for us gamers haha) awesome! :D",4.0
Had tio return this because it was too small. I am giving it 4 stars because the scan rate was a little too fast for my gaming skill level.,4.0
"I played the beta for about 4 hours when this came out, and then I pre-ordered it from PS4 as a present for my significant others birthday.  Opening night I knew I had to work early the next morning so I created my character and went to sleep.
First off  I enjoyed the video clips, they were extremely well made and unlike in many games, I didn't roll my eyes and start button mashing to make them go away.  Next was character creation.  Im a female and if given the opportunity I will almost always chose to play a female.  I guess a little background here  I like RPGs and am VERY VERY bad at shooters.  If you are reading this you have probably killed me many times on Star Wars Battlefront.  I am at home on games like the Dragon Age series or old school Final Fantasy (PS2 and older). My man was able to convince me to try this by pointing out that it is advertised as an RPG.

So Character creation  There were 5 female heads to choose from and like 5 hairstyles (none of which included a pony tail, pony tails make perfect sense in the post apocalypse world). I tried making a Caucasian female that looks a bit like me only with a tattoo.  I ended up with a female that I think might be Asian and who looks like a muddy 12 year old boy.  Let us just say I was a bit let down by the character creator  but I pressed on.  I figured, this is a game designed for guys and most of them probably aren't worried about if they can make their person look like they want.  So after making my girl and opening up in Brooklyn  I went to bed.

Apparently this is when all of the servers crashed because I heard an earful about it the next day.  I would have had no idea because apparently they weren't down for too long.  I went to sleep and my man was playing, I got up at 6am and he was still playing when I left for work.  I got home from work and he was so far ahead of me that I decided to play by myself until some of my friends got online.  This is an important thing to note  this game requires internet.  If your internet is down, sketchy or non-existent  don't get this game because you won't be able to play it.

So back to the game  I started out in Brooklyn by myself.  The world was I don't want to use the word pretty for a post-apocalyptic game but the visuals were amazing.  Attention to detail and realistic artistry gets an A+ from me.  Then I start running around.  Okay so it took me a bit to figure out how to run, how to find my way around, using the map and the options button.  I was disappointed that I couldn't find more of a tutorial because Im not used to shooting games.  The movement of my character looked good but I kept finding myself crouching against things facing the wrong way.  Glued to the wrong wall or trying to run under cover and leaping over a wall on accident instead.  The first 3 hours of me playing by myself involved a LOT of dying, the game looked great while I was dying, but I wasn't having much fun.  I finally screamed for my now level 15 counterpart in the next room to come explain to me how to throw a grenade.  He gave me a quick tutorial on the buttons (which apparently you double tap  not mash) and tried to get me to comprehend the duck and cover strategy of fighting.  Once I gave up on the duck and cover making sense (how the hell am I getting cover from a chain link fence?) I was suddenly much better at the game.  He also told me that I wasn't insane  there really wasn't any way to run while ducking or crouch.  So after accepting these oddities I finally made it to Manhattan.

This is where I was joined by three of my friends.  They were one level ahead of me so we were more closely aligned as far as unlocked skills.  This is when the game became fun to me.  We worked together to rescue some people, unlock the wings of our bases, discussed the distribution of skills so that we were well equipped for the next firefight, figured out crafting together.  And we were winning battles  not easily, but we were winning.  This is where the game shines.  It is clearly built to run with teams.  I discussed with my man  and he said that he and his friends tried to solo several of the missions and its almost impossible. The game is built to play with others.
I realized that I actually can play a shooting game and that in order for me to be able to play well  I have to just accept that my person has no sense and that I cant duck and cover where I want.  Clearly she doesnt know how to go prone, cant run while crouching and won't step down two feet off of a curb but can parkour like a champ.  I just have to accept her for who she is (or he, if it really is a 12 year old Asian boy) and play her the way she is meant to be played.

There is SO much to do in this game that I imagine it will keep me busy for quite some time.  If you like duck and cover games, playing with your friends and shooting bad guys for a LONG TIME (seriously, my man was in an hour long firefight in the next room) then this is the game for you.  If you want something to play solo then this is not the game for you.  Also there is supposed to be oodles of new stuff added to the game so as it gets added, hopefully I will remember to come and update.  We have the season pass so its on!

**UPDATE 1**
So I was level 12 in PVE when me and two of my friends tried out the Dark Zone.  My two friends were level 16 and 18 at the time in PVE but none of us had been in the Dark Zone, which meant we were all DZ level 1.  We wandered into the lv 1-14 Dark Zone area... and everything went bad for me.  Apparently since they are above the PVE level 14 - I couldn't see them and they couldn't see me.  I have since been told that there is a way for us to group up even though we are in different level brackets but have not managed this yet.  Needless to say I walked into the DZ with two friends and discovered I was suddenly soloing.  So I figured I'll just scout around and see what the deal is.  I died very quickly to some mobs. It was awful... and I never saw another player.  SOOOO, I hop out and see that I have some other friends who are the same level as me on.  I jump in with them for an hour or so and we head to the DZ.  This was so much more fun.  We killed lots of mobs, extracted 3 times (that's a hell of a firefight every time) and then accidentally went rogue.  I say accidentally because one guy in our group intentionally shot and killed another player - thinking he was a boss (or so he claimed) then suddenly we were all rogue.  Now I hadn't killed a player, but there was a bounty on my head.  So we ran like all holy hell and hid until the timer ran out.  Later we had a guy kill one of our team and we took out the rogue.  The whole thing was not the blood bath I had envisioned.  First of all most of the players we ran across were just as nervous about us being there as we were of them.  I'm told in the highest level PVP areas it is more of a bloodbath, but at the beginner area where I was, I managed to make it in and out with a team.

Also in PVE - we discovered that the mobs level scale to the highest leveled player in your group.  I don't like that, I would prefer it did more of an average.  There are people I play with who don't work (retired, disabled, in college, etc), they race up through the levels and now unless those of us who are only able to play a few hours a day or less can play with them is to accept that we will be fighting mobs 3x the normal level.  Example - last night at the end of the evening we had a level 7, 12, 13 and 21.  It would have made sense for the baddies to be level 14ish - instead they were level 21.  My poor friend who was level 7 was dead most of the night.  Me and the Lv 12 struggled and at times ended up in a never ending rez chain while our lv 21 friend had to pretty much do most of the killing.  This prevents people from being able to group up with friends that they may want to play with just because of level disparity. For a game that is built to play with your friends - this seems to go against that, forcing you instead to find similarly leveled strangers.

**UPDATE 2**
I have now been in the endgame for quite some time.  They have added:
-The Incursions which are difficult at first but a lot of fun to figure out with a team.  On Challenging they drop high end gear.  Falcons Lost is 15 waves of bad guys you have to defeat which include drones all the while an APC is shooting at you.  The other one is a constant stream of bad guys who are trying to prevent you from putting two boxes into a container then you kill their heavily armored boss.  Not as much fun as the first but still entertaining the first few times.
-High Value Targets, both weekly and daily with the weekly again dropping high end gear.  You gather intel then buy the location of the HVT and go off to take them down.  Generally there are 4 waves of enemies and on the fifth wave the boss appears.  These pop randomly through a group of predetermined locations throughout the map - the locations can certainly turn an easy fight into a very tough one quickly (cleaners on top of the building anyone?)
-Supply Drops in the Dark Zone - race everyone and their mother to a location of a supply drop that generally has pretty good gear in it - fight off the bad guys protecting it and all of the other agents trying to get to it first.
-Cutting the rope in the DZ - so now you can hijack other people's extractions, but if you plan on doing it come with your A game, because most people don't like their stuff getting stolen, and will fight to get it back.",4.0

"Work exactly as they're supposed too. I bought these only for my PS4 controller. At first they were difficult to put on but a neat trick is to flip it inside out, and flip it back out to normal as you place the grips above the analog. After I set them on my controllers I immediately tested them out only to find out one of them was slightly too thick. When I move the analog 360 degrees the rubber hits the edges of the analog boundary and slows down rotation. Overall this is a great product.",4.0
"Like the description says, this is a collection of three Metal Gear Solid games. It contains the original Playstation version of Metal Gear Solid, as well as the two director's cut versions of the Playstation 2 installments of  the series - Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance and Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence.

When I say the collection contains the original Playstation version of Metal Gear Solid, I really mean the original Playstation. This is surprising considering the age of that system and the fact it's on two discs. A PS2 port would have allowed players to rely on a PS2 memory card and allowed the game to fit on one disc. If you don't have a PS1 memory card, you're out of luck. Fortunately, the game is playable on the PS3 using the system's built-in memory card feature.

All three games are, as the boxes say, ""tactical espionage action"" games. You can try to blast your way through the enemies, but that really isn't very bright. If you're seen by an enemy, they'll call for help, and from that point on, an endless stream of enemies will come to find you. If you're able to successfully hide long enough, however, the enemies will return to their posts.

MGS is the simplest of the games, relying primarily on an overhead view to essentially make the gameplay 2D. You can't shoot in first-person, but Snake does automatically track his targets. In addition to the main game, MGS also has a VR Training mode, where you not only learn a few basics, but can also challenge yourself to obtain better times in each of the ten courses.

MGS2: Substance, greatly improves on the gameplay by adding the abilities to shoot in first-person, climb small boxes, dive, shoot from cover, and hang from ledges. Soldiers can also be shot in different parts of the body for different effects. A head shot will kill an enemy in one hit, but aiming for the body will require you to use more ammo. Substance also has a great deal of bonuses. There's a VR training mode, greatly improved from MGS. Initially, you can play as either Snake or Raiden, and as you complete more courses, new characters are unlocked. While the course layouts remain the same for each character, enemy placement changes to provide varying levels of difficulty. In addition to a Stealth and Eliminate All Enemies mode, the VR training also provides weapon training courses where you use the games many weapons to destroy targets. Another of Substance's game play modes is Snake Tales, where you play through the Big Shell, one of the game's areas, as Snake instead of Raiden. Finally, an amusing skateboarding mode turns the Big Shell into a sort of Tony Hawk Pro Skater course allowing you to skate through with Snake or Raiden in an attempt to complete various tasks and earn points for performing various skating tricks.

Finally, MGS3: Subsistence takes you back in time to the 1960's where you play as Snake's father, Naked Snake. In the Soviet jungles, Naked Snake has to use camouflage and his survival techniques to infiltrate enemy bases. The game requires that you treat your injuries and keep your stamina up by eating food. This means you have to hunt for food and raid enemy storage houses for medical supplies. Naked Snake also knows a fighting style known as close-quarter combat (CQC). This allows Snake to grab enemies and perform a variety of moves from there, including interrogation, using the enemy as a shield while you fire on his comrades, or just plain slamming him into the ground and knocking him unconscious. The abilities granted by CQC add a new dimension to the game that makes fighting your way through enemy bases much more feasible.

The games are fun to play once you're accustomed to the controls. Substance and Subsistence have so many controls, that they are overwhelming to new MGS players. If you take the time to learn them, though, you'll find deep games with an endless amount of possibilities.",4.0

Cons: The mic feedback option is great, but it picks up EVERYTHING. Can hear my wife rummaging through a plastic bag in the next room as if she's 10 feet away. Haven't found any way to modify sensitivity for Xbox One. Headset doesn't seem to remember volume settings once controller is turned off or disconnected, and the default volume is way too loud.

"Kirby made his short and sweet debut on the Game Boy in 1992 with Kirby's Dream Land. At the same time, a new Nintendo franchise was born. Before he was a cute, pink puff ball he was just a plain old white ghost looking ball who had to rescue his homeland from the clutches of his nemesis, King Dedede. While the Kirby games were better efforts, the first one proved there was something about him and his platform game that was simple and fun.

Kirby's Dream Land lets you control Kirby through 5 stages filled with enemies, pitfalls and spikes. Kirby can inhale his enemies and either swallow them or spit them out at other enemies. He can also pick up health power ups and 1-ups to help stay in the game. At the end of each stage, you face off against a boss and use a simple pattern strategy to beat it.

The PROS: A platform game that didn't star Mario would normally mean it wasn't going to be good. This isn't the case with Kirby's Dream Land. From the bright and crisp graphics to the pleasant music and solid controls, this game pleased anyone who managed to play it from beginning to end. Nintendo knew they had a hit by keeping things simple for the time being and for that, it's a game that is fun to play.

The CONS: With only 5 stages, it's over before you know it. And while you had to beat it in one shot (no passwords, save system or continues here), it wasn't a hard game at all.

It was short and sweet but fun at the same time. Millions of copies were sold and only prompted Nintendo to make sequels, which were better efforts overall. So if you're curious about where Kirby started out and you have yet to play this game, search for a used copy and pop it into your Game Boy. You won't regret it.",4.0
"That's not to say it's a bad game.  It just seemed to me that there were a few elements in the game that the developers relied on to carry it, and instead of beefing up every level, every character, every little bite of programming... they left a lot of it so-so because you could now DUAL WEILD!  And you had MORE VEHICLES!  And, uh, was there anything else?

In most of my reviews, I just cover the negatives.  But I still gave this game four stars.  So keep that in mind if you think I hated this game.  I didn't.  I just point out things that I think will make you throw your controller through the screen, in case you're prone to doing that and you don't want to break another tv.

First off, the AI is NOT better than the original.  Yes, they'll hop into a vehicle and ride alongside you, which is cool at first... until they run you down, crash into you, or oh-so commonly go flying over a cliff to their impending doom.  What a waste.  And if you're manning a turret on the back of a vehicle with the AI driving, for the most part it ""works.""  It's a fun twist on the gameplay, which I so desired after not being able to get my AI teammates to drive for me in the original.  But they'll also stop at inopportune times, as if they didn't *see* that missile or plasma shot coming at us, resulting in a painful, fiery death.

The friendly AI is about the same as the first game when they're on foot.  Not shabby.  If you don't know where to go next, just look for your team and chances are they'll be en route already.  But they also have a penchant for diving for cover in FRONT of your moving vehicle, which is just silly.

Now, I wonder if it's because of the arrangement of the levels or WHAT, but the enemy AI didn't seem as interested in taking cover or flanking me this time around.  They only flank if they're cloaked.  So despite the new Brutes charging at me all the time, I kinda felt like I was shooting alien fish in a barrel.

And the Brutes bring up another big topic: The AI is cheap.  This isn't to say I think they're more sophisticated, since they kill me a lot.  It's just how they DO it that irks me.  In the original Halo, everyone killed me plenty, but they did it with skill.  I had to die a bunch of times to learn the lay of the land, where the enemies were, and what my best plan of attack was.  It...was...FUN.  This time around, I died waaay too many times because a Brute was charging at me faster than I could retreat / take cover, and when it caught up to me, it would hit me twice with the same shoulder charge, effectively killing me almost every time.  It was just frustrating, because it wasn't a learning experience.  And good luck if you respawn two feet away from the guy on the next try.

Brutes were nasty, but Elites would pull this same kind of thing on me by sideswiping me with their energy swords while cloaked.  Always a matter of not being able to move out of the way in time, even if I *knew* they were there.

Next topic: LEVELS AND DEBRIS.  I don't know about you, but there sure was a lot of junk in the way on these levels.  Much more than in the previous game.  And when you're backing away from a charging Brute, or sidestepping to avoid a raptor-like attack from an Elite, you'll probably run into a pile of crates, shrapnel, or Covenant weapons cases on more than one occasion, leading to your impending death.  This is definitely one of the most frustrating elements in this game.  What happened to open landscapes, or even large rooms on ships?  Why is everything so cramped, 99% of the time?  You have a super-cyborg at your command, and he'll be bumpin' around like a drunk Pacman.

The game graphically kicked my butt thoroughly when I first fired it up.  The first few levels offered SO MUCH.  The cinematics drew me in, and some of the stuff I encountered in the gameplay was just ridiculously cool.  But then... ugh... then it slumped.  The levels got 'dreary.'  A note to Bungie, if you're going to make a very dark, dank level, MAKE SURE THE CHARACTER HAS A FLASHLIGHT!  Even the levels that didn't require a flashlight were kinda 'blah' after five minutes.

Last gripe on that topic - I KNOW I'm a super cool alien or cyborg who can jump about 15 feet in the air (higher than the last game even), but do I really NEED to jump to get up on a 2 foot ledge?  If only I had flashing red lights on my sneakers to help the enemies see me even MORE clearly....  Why not make the jump button `sensitive?'  Even in the days of the first Mario games, we could jump a *little* or jump a *lot* depending on if we tapped the button or held it.  I felt like I was playing Master Jordon, not Master Chief.

But wait, there's MORE!  The game was abrupt.  There *wasn't* more.  The storyline was really good, kind of what I expected after the last game, but with a few extra twists and innovations.  And there were multiple 'boss' fights that I really didn't expect, but was very excited about.  But the last one was just, well... it made sense on a story-telling level, but the gameplay part of it wasn't working for me.  I really didn't 'get' how I finished the boss off after trying to figure out his weakness for 15 minutes and over so many retries.  The ending itself didn't bother me a lot.  And there's a little extra after the credits, worth seeing.

Sort-of-Pros:

LOTS of people complained about playing as the Arbiter for over half of the game, including Bungie stating that ""it didn't work.""  I hate these complaints.  Probably because of these whiny Master Chief Fanboys, Halo 3 didn't include any Arbiter-played levels.  I think it'll still be good, since he's a major part of the story still, but I just don't get how everyone could hate his levels so much.  The worst part of it in Halo 2 is that he's going through the same missions that Master Chief followed in the first game, which sometimes felt rehashed.  But I still liked it, because they kept it fresh with his VERY different perspective on what he was doing.  --from a fanatical religious aspect, rather than saving the galaxy.  Plus, he feels betrayed by his OWN world, whereas in the first game the betrayers were always the alien race that you were fighting anyway.

And he doesn't have a flashlight, but rather a short-term cloaking ability.  This made sneaking up on my enemies a lot of fun, especially with the energy sword one-hit-kill melee weapon.  So now you can control when you go invisible (on Arbiter levels), but I noticed that there weren't any invisibility shields just lying around like last time.  So don't expect Master Chief to pull the same move.

The Problem With Guns Is...

I didn't like all the new weapons.  There's a grenade launcher called the Brute Shot (?), and it seems cool at first because it launches grenades hard and fast, but when I realized I had to fire it 3 or 4 times to drop a Brute, and then the reload time was long enough for that brute's friend to run across a football field and kill me, I gave up on it.  Fun, pointless weapon.  There are two semi-auto earth rifles, neither being the original from the first game, and neither being that good, either.  Dual weilding the smaller one is a pain, because the sight picture jumps around a lot, making it hard to hit anything.  And the other one shoots in 3-round bursts, and has a weak ammo capacity.  It's stronger, but neither compares to the original.  The original wasn't exceptional, but you'll demand its return after playing with these.  Halo 2 made me miss it.  The Covenant have regular Plasma Rifles, and Brute Plasma Rifles now.  I'm going to go ahead and assume that the Brute's version is more powerful.  I have to assume so, because it gets hot and overheats in half the time it takes a regular one to overheat, so its functionality was null to me.  The Covenant's version of a sniper rifle is handy in THEIR hands, but not in yours.  It just doesn't drop anything but the grunts.  I never really needed the earth sniper rifle, either, whereas I always loved getting my hands on one in the first game.  There just weren't any real tactical uses for it because of the level designs in this game (cluttered levels).  If you could get your hands on one, it probably wasn't in a real sniper-friendly level.  The shotgun was pivotal in the first game when facing the Flood, but it didn't really seem that effective this time around.  I stopped using it right away, because it didn't have the 'oomph' it had the first time around.  Very weak.  The little handheld plasma gun still homes when charged, but again, it isn't that effective.  Now, there's a 'laser beam' gun - the Sentinel's primary weapon - and this is pretty good for mowing down most enemies... ESPECIALLY anything mechanical.  And most weapons (I noticed the covenant weapons especially) were VERY effective at taking out enemy vehicles.

Vehicles are so easy to destroy this time around.  It's probably because they threw in so many of them.  There are never just one or two inbound vehicles.  There are dozens.  So to balance it out, they made them easy to blow up.  Most notably, Ghosts and Banshees.

But don't worry - it's not so bad when you're piloting one.  They seem a bit more durable when you're behind the wheel.  And for the most part, driving them is more fun, too.  The Ghosts, Banshees, and formerly non-commandeer-able Wraiths all have a new turbo ability, where you can dart ahead quickly.  You sacrifice your ability to fire until you return to regular speed, but it's not that bad.  While the Ghosts are a little more fun, and most of the other vehicles remained relatively the same as their last iteration, I guess the only complaints here are in regards to the Banshee.  It has new ""tricks"" you can perform.  (Think Starfox 64).  Loops, barrel-rolls... all very smooth and easy to perform, but not very useful.  In exchange, we lose the Banshee's cannon.  Only itty-bitty rapid fire plasma blasts now.  None of the big, crowd-clearing bombs.  That, my friends, was turned into a handheld weapon that takes up half the screen and merely compensates the Covenant with their own version of a Rocket Launcher.  (But it's really no compensation for the Rocket Launcher.  It launches a fart cloud, from what I can tell.)

Now, being able to board just about any vehicle by hopping on top of it and pulling out the driver is WAY cool.  Especially when you're up in the air and a painful stop at the bottom of a ravine awaits the poor sap piloting the vehicle.

Lastly, their storytelling in this game is at an all-time high.  Granted, it's not always the most original stuff (it's sci-fi, and you know the universe has just GOT to be in trouble), but it was the best you can get for the HALO story.  They never dropped the ball, and they took the story in the best possible direction it could've gone.  In a way, I want to argue that Master Chief probably had TOO MUCH spotlight time in this game, since it's really not that central to his character.  It's all about the Covenant, and I'm glad we got to see sooo much of its inner workings this time.

So even if they cleaned up all of the gameplay mechanics that I had issue with, I don't know if they can write as intricate of a STORY for Halo 3.  Here's hoping.  I figure it'll probably be more about explosions and massive attacks, which is FINE for gameplay, but not storyline.  I like me a plot twist!

For instance, I didn't think ""Little House of Horrors"" could've made its way into a Halo game, but it did, and it was AWESOME.

And why do I feel like I'm shooting at Chewbacca every time I kill a Brute?  I hope they're not brown and hairy next time around.  This game already has enough star wars copyright infringement to dodge....

"Generally I enjoyed this game, but honestly, I was glad to be through it; paranormal horror is just not my preference for a FPS.

The Pros:

Good smooth action and great graphics if you've the hardware to run it properly.

Spooky atmosphere, (better than Doom3) with some surprises that will give you a jolt.

Easy  game saves (and you need to do this very often) with the quick save F5 key, as well as several checkpoint saves done by the game itself.

Some new weapons and some interesting enemies; The Slow/mo feature really added an interesting aspect of some of the firefights you get into. In fact, it would've been very difficult to get through this game without it.

The Cons:

1.)Very linear game play when on a mission.

2.)Only three types of building used throughout the entire game; that being 1.) office tower, 2.) decaying apartment building and 3.) vault/research center. The office towers had the majority of the action; but the multiple cubbyhole workstations, made for very repetitious play and became quite monotonous after a while (not to mention confusing). There was only a few short outside scenes.

3.)It was difficult, in many cases, to figure out where to go next, once your mission was completed (especially true in the office towers). I found that once you completed a mission,  some previously  locked door or gateway became open, and you had to go back and find it before you were able to proceed on your new task.

4.)You only had access to your 3 most recent saved games; and, as you could only carry three weapons at any one time, it was sometimes difficult to know if you should pick up a new weapon (while discarding another one) just before you were about to change locales forever (where you could not possibly return to without restarting a previously saved game).

5.)No ""bosses"" to fight, even at the end. A rather dull and anticlimactic finale. ""Boss"" fights have always been one of my favorite parts of FPSs and I missed them in this game.

6.)And finally, the game has no replay value whatsoever; I can't think of a single mission or scene I'd be remotely interested in replaying again.

All in all, a different type of FPS. If you don't mind the horror aspect, then this is a game you might enjoy.",4.0

"The Good: Tons of fighters, fun Konquest mode, Kreate-A-Fatality keeps things fresh, Kreate-A-Fighter is excellent, the game looks good, Motor Kombat is a nice idea...

The Bad: ...But not well executed, no staged fatalities, terrible voice acting, no Chess or Puzzle Kombat

Mortal Kombat is one of those series that is loved by all, but then pitied. Mortal Kombat has grown over the years, but hasn't quite matured right especially in terms of visuals. Armageddon is kind of a pot luck stew of every MK character ever dreamed up. This, being the goodbye game to the beloved series, has over 50 fighters and lots of different modes and is bursting at the seams with content (kontent). Most people will immediately dive into the arcade kombat mode. You will notice there is every fighter imaginable in the MK universe and this includes bosses. Once you pick your character you will see the classic Kombat Ladder and the fight begins.

Once you start fighting players of Deadly Alliance and especially Deception will be familiar with the controls. Mortal Kombat is not really a button mashing fighter and this is why a lot of people hate the series. Because they have to think before they start throwing punches. You can view a full move list in the pause menu, but what you get your favorite combos and the special moves memorized you can start kicking ass. Each character has their own real life martial arts style plus a weapon style. Deception and Deadly Alliance had two fighting styles and a weapon, but one had to be cut for balance issues.

The controls are extremely responsive and the characters are animated very nicely. While they look a bit like plastic dolls and kind of fight like them the animations are smooth and there is no slow down. New to Deception were arena traps and this has been transitioned over in Armageddon. You will see either yellow or red lines around certain areas or objects. Yellow means that it's just a dangerous trap and won't instantly kill you, but will deal some hefty damage. This can be an air duct that will shoot you through a fan, or getting knocked into a bell, or even into a giant egg and having acid spewed on you. Red lines mean instant kills and you need to stay away from them. These can be grinders, deadly pits, or anything that can crush. A lot of the arenas are multi-tiered and these will be marked with yellow lines as well. This really makes fighting intense, and not to mention that the arenas look awesome.

Fatalities are still here, as always, but with a twist. The MK team decided to do a Kreate-A-Fatality setup in which you don't have to press any codes to see a staged fatality. The whole system is pretty complicated since there are transition moves, finishers, and each set goes into each other. You can do up to 11 moves, but you have to end in a finisher move for it to register as a fatality. With each move your timer bar depletes faster and faster so precision and fast input speed is a must. You can do a few forward chains such as ripping out a heart, brain, maybe a punch or two, then decide to go either into a face down, behind, or on the knees transition. If you have to put that code in then decide if you want to finish or continue from a behind transition set, on the knees and so on. It becomes very complicated and a lot of people didn't like this feature calling it ""Generic Fatalities"" but doing two fatalities for 50+ characters was too daunting so they needed to figure something out.

Besides your core fighting in here the Konquest mode is back and better than ever. Forget the irritating, ugly, and boring one one Deception. The team used the Shaolin Monks engine so you get to fight in real time via grabs, kicks, heavy and light punches. You acquire power ups throughout the game, as well as performing fatalities by just pressing a button once the enemy is dazed. You can go around collecting relics to unlock hidden stuff in the Krypt, as well as alternate costumes, music, and koins. Some times you will run across weapons to hack and slash enemies, as well as doing actual Kombat with characters you run across.

The story is more interesting than any other MK side story that has a lot of mystery wrapped around it. New characters Taven and Daegon awaken from a slumber by the call of Blaze (yeah that hidden character in Deadly Alliance). Daegon is trying to find his father while discovering why he needs to fight his brother and how to become the new Emperor of Edenia. Overall the Konquest mode is very entertaining and is a welcome treat.

Another, questionable, mini-game is Motor Kombat which is a cart racing game. This could have been greatly improved on, but it's entertaining for awhile. You pick your favorite MK character (a select few) and run across a star which will allow you to use your weapon, or a lightning bolt which is a burst of speed. You can bump people left or right into death traps (marked by red lines). There are jumps and the tracks are laid out different, but there could have been more power-ups instead of just one set one for the character, and I would have like the levels to be more alive. Motor Kombat is fun at best with more players, but other than that you'll forget about it after you play all the stages.

I finally come to Kreate-A-Fighter mode and this has been a huge request by fans since Deadly Alliance. You get a lot of customization options, and you can buy more accessories with the koins you collect from all modes of the game. You can set moves, fighting style, finishing stance, and even write out a bio (pull out that dusty PS2 keyboard!) You can do pretty much anything you want with the character and there are so many items that not one will look the same. There are even some conspicuous items that look like super heroes or real life heroes as well. You can take your character online and hone your skills against other people's characters (as of this review Xbox LIVE has been shut off so local play is only possible. Besides even before no one was playing online anymore). This feature is greatly welcomed and is a blast to use.

The Krypt returns for a third time, but simpler. Instead of different kinds of colored koins there's just one type and you can unlock tons of stuff. Anything from concept art, videos, sketches, alternate costumes, and music. Armageddon is chalk full of content, but it does have its flaws.

For instance the visuals. While they look nice they don't really push the systems to their limits. The voice acting is terrible in Konquest mode, and like I said before the characters look a bit like plastic dolls and the animations are a bit canned. The Kreate-A-Fatality mode is not welcomed well and I would like to have seen set fatalities for each character. Motor Kombat is pretty lackluster, and it's obvious the game needs a reboot. I also would have liked to see Chess Kombat and Puzzle Kombat, from Deception, included in here as well, but they are sadly absent. Until then Armageddon should keep fans and new comers entertained for hours on end.",4.0
Good game but a little hard for younger kids to play but the older kids love it,4.0
"Not an easy task to make a video game out of such an acclaimed film, one of the few (if not only) sequels considered superior to the original.  The first Godfather game was a lot of fun, taking parts of GTA, parts of the EA James Bond engine, and adding some new elements as you worked your way up in the family by extorting, killing, and uh, getting respect.

The new game improves on that engine, features essentially the same aim (build an empire, extort and kill), and adds a few new touches.  For one, there's more strategy involved as you manage your empire via the 'Don's View', which is a Start menu letting you review family trees, rackets, favors, and other fun stuff.  You can also build your own family, including your own crew of underboss, capos, and soldiers, by recruiting new made guys who have different specialties.  Up to three crew members will follow you around at any given time, and they'll gladly assist in the drive-by shootings, maimings, and beat downs that are a requirement to building up your street cred.  Depending on the mission, you can swap out crew members to make sure you have the right specialists.

Once again, the action is woven into the storyline of Part 2, though this time it's a lot looser than the original game.  Michael, Tom Hagen, Fredo, Pentangeli, Hyman Roth, and Senator Geary are all present, as are the rival Rosato Brothers.  There's a few 'made-up' families who take you to war, too.  And there's the Havana angle, as you team up with the CIA in an attempt to whack Castro post-revolution(!)  There are rackets to control, which provide you with upgrades (bulletproof vests that go over your outfits and never come off once achieved), extra ammo, incendiary ammo, etc.  Once again, you must intimidate some honest (and dishonest) folks by beating and choking them, and destroying their businesses.  Naturally, there's some talk of honor and respect family and loyalty along the way.

And since you control a new character (the loyal soldier of the first game's character, who gets killed early in this game), there's none of the intrigue and ambiguity of Part II's storyline of Michael traveling around trying to figure out who knows what, who betrayed who, and who tried to have who killed and why and when and who ordered the hits and who did put that bullet in Mo Greene's eye?

There's some unintentionally funny stuff, too.  Your character, who's supposed to be a tough Italian street hood, sounds very white bread, making the cut scenes humorous.  If you do a favor for someone and they ask you to beat/kill/rob/smash, there's a quick and jerky cut to you going ""Yes!"" and then you accept the mission.  Or to hear the character's corny voice say something like, ""Do you want to join the life?  This Thing of Ours?""  Perhaps even real mob guys would get a kick out of it.

I do agree with criticisms that the game is a bit unfinished and could have used additional tweaking.  Given the standards set by a GTA IV (and even of the original Godfather game), they could have done a bit more with this formula.  Granted, the sound and graphics are better, but there's no mind-blowing improvement here.  And of course, the non-adjustable difficulty level makes this rather easy to complete, and once your done, the replay value is questionable (all you can really do is just run around and cause havoc, which has a better vehicle in GTA IV).  The action can get repetitive, as you go into a cycle of meet contact / accept contract, and storm a rival family's business or compound and cause havoc.

However, the havoc is quite good, and it's upgraded from the first outing---this is an extremely violent and bloody game.  With the addition of a crew, you can have long, drawn out battles with the cops (and the Cuban military in Havana) and it really starts to emulate GTA with exploding cars, machine guns, and general insanity.  And there are plenty of side machines for more dirty work, though these two follow a typical pattern.  Random people on the street need 'favors' (someone needs to 'disappear' or 'be taught a lesson'), and for successful completion of these missions you get tips on where to whack made guys, or you get straight up cash.  Speaking of cash, eventually, you become flush with the green and may well max out your expenses, which generally consist of upgrading yourself and your crew with skills, and hiring more goons to protect your rackets.  You can also have fun by using 'Mobface' to change your character's look at any given time, making the cut scenes that much more amusing.

There's a weird angle on the setting, too.  This is supposed to be 1958-59, yes?  Yet the details do not match...it sometimes seems to be a hybrid of late-50s and then late 60s detail with the cars, music, clothes, etc.  There's a classic 60s-era Mustang, for instance, and some massive Cadillacs from the 60s...it's nitpicking, but why play with the timeline when they were faithful with the original (for the most part)?

Overall, would definitely recommend the game to fans of the original outing, and actually to all Godfather fans.  Despite its shortcomings, it's still a lot of fun, plenty of shooter action and madness, and hey, it's a game based on The Godfather Part II (taking many liberties, of course).  They've digitized Hyman Roth, and whoever does the voice does an amazing job.  Note that there's nothing here that deals with the other half of the film, the flashbacks to young Don Corleone's life (with DeNiro).  That would have been fun, to take on Don Fannuci in early 20th Century New York.  But alas, the brutality, the beatings, the goon squad (you can even change your crew's outfits from suits to bad Hawaiian shirts), the cars, the civilian casualties...all of it will get the job done.",4.0
"When it comes to licensed video games, whether they be licensed from movies, comics, or both; the case usually ends up being that the game is a rushed and buggy mess that has little to do with what it is licensed from in the first place.  Well, we should all rejoice because what we get with X-Men Origins: Wolverine is something that is quite the contrary.  Wolverine is a bloody and oh so fun blast that delivers the action goods, and a good amount of surprisingly violent gameplay.  The game is a simple beat 'em up at its core, but it is designed pretty well considering this is a licensed tie-in type of game, and utilizes Wolverine's claws and abilities to great effect.  The enemies are actually pretty varied as well, which is a change of pace considering the genre, and there are some great boss fights to be had with familiar foes like Sabretooth, Gambit, Blob, and the Sentinels.  Film stars Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber even lend their voices to the game as Wolverine and Sabretooth, and provide some good work as well.  The only drawbacks to X-Men Origins: Wolverine lie in the fact that at its heart the game is fairly easy to get through, and isn't all that long either.  Still, you won't find many licensed tie-in games that are better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and if you're a Wolverine/X-Men fan in the least, you should definitely check this game out.",4.0

"I loved Medal of Honor and finally broke down and played Medal of Honor 2: Frontline.  The game is really fun and challenging especially to the casual gamer such as myself.  The array of weapons to choose from made the game more interesting as I constantly had to think and use the best weapon for each scenario put in front of me.  The AI is decent but at times can be frustrating.  You can be right up next to a guy shoot ten times in the gut and the guy will not die.  Then, he will smack you with his gun and half your health is taken away.  There are also some graphical glitches such as dead bodies in mid air and dead bodies going through brick walls.  I did not find that aspect all that frustrating though.  I thought that it was kind of funny.  The allies that run around with you on some levels are not very intelligent and stand right in the middle of a mess of Nazis and tanks waiting to get blown up.
The only reason that this game does not receive a 5 star rating is because of the HORRIBLE SAVE FUNCTION.  There is no possible way to save your game half way through a level.  You must fully complete the level with no saves.  As a casual gamer I get killed all the time and usually near the end of a level that JUST TOOK 45 MINUTES to get to that point.  Zing!  I'm dead and I have to start the level over at the VERY BEGINNING...  Some levels had to be repeated some 10 times or more just to move on.  I would like to see A BETTER SAVE FUNCTION in the Medal of Honor games.  As a casual gamer I'm not the best shot and don't want to spend hours upon hours repeating levels.
As a whole though, the game is very fun and worth the $ it costs.",4.0

For veterans of the series you have to relearn the new instrument as you have to hold multiple buttons while strumming in an constricted area. This feels more challenging and fun and you don't have to slide your hand down slightly on higher difficulties.

Song selection are okay. Included in the disc are recognizable songs from the past decade or so if you listen to the radio or keep in tune with top charts often. You do get more songs in an online game mode (more on this later)

There are two modes in the game: Live and TV

Live: Your basic guitar hero campaign. You play through multiple songs per stage and try to get a high score. There are probably a dozen stages to play through unlocking songs for quick play. Instead of in-game graphics, you get a FMV of a live concert making you appear as if you're playing in front of a live audience. Seems very interesting at first, but after a while it starts getting old as the actors overact and the crowd is very bi-polor (either love you or hate you). The camera pans from scene to scene very fluidly and depending how mad or good you do: your bandmates or audience will give you a thumbs up/nod, or thumbs down/disappointed head shake among other different interactions. After you unlock all 40+ songs you are not able to buy individual dlc tracks like in past guitar hero titles...and this is where TV comes in

TV: TV mode is basically a 24hour radio but with per-programmed tracks that plays throughout the day. You do get a preview of what's coming up, but you do not get a choice in what tracks you can play unless you purchase a track for a limited time (more on this later) as you just play whatever is on at the time. There's two separate currency in the game which you can earn by playing the game or purchasing them as micro-transactions via in-game store . Guitar hero coins and points. Coins you can use to upgrade profile or purchase guitar hero points. Guitar hero points lets you play any track from the entire library, but only for a limited of time, so it's like a rental track. There's no way to purchase it permanently which is disappointing especially when there are more than double the tracks on TV than on disc. Instead of the live concert, TV mode has the original music video playing in the background.

Future of Guitar Hero Live:
No drums, just two guitars and vocals
There will not be a Guitar Hero Live 2 according Activision as they'll be constantly adding new tracks to the TV mode. Some of the songs will come and go depending on the license, like how movies/tv shows disappear from Netflixs from time-to-time.

Overall for the core experience the price isn't bad, but if you want additional tracks you have to shell our in-game currency or real money for a rental play service.",4.0
"I have never picked up an EA game until I bought my DS a couple months ago, and I had to try this, given the hype.  Since I am a newbie, it seems overwhelming to try to pick up on all the nuances, the various plays, which player to control, how to control the kicker (both power and accuracy) and the like, but you know what?  It is a heck of a lot of FUN!  I play with my favorite team, the Vikings, and Adrian Peterson will still break off a 70 yard run despite my flaws on which buttons to mash.  I have started the training modes, and can give an update later, but if you are a football fan, this is a must have.",4.0

Sure it's easy, but it's meant for the kiddies, not for the hardcore gamer. The graphics get the job done without too much pop-up (although it's there) and the voice acting is solid.

"People complain about it being broken but honestly what FPS has came out and just worked perfect? The same is true for ANY software. Look at Windows. How broken is each new OS initially? Fact is a company can only test in-house so much and public beta testing isn't simple when you think about how many people or that some people just want to play early and not really help test etc..

The content of the game itself I liked. Single player and MP.
It did have some issues but I always expect that and now most of them are ironed out. I still have fun playing and no issues.

The only thing I hate is the direction DLC is going. You basically have to buy games twice now. The game and ""Premium"" to get the rest of the maps. Don't buy Premium and you have trouble finding servers to play on with people or get tired of the same few maps fast.

Overall it's a decent game and now the price has dropped (though cause new one going out soon) makes it a decent deal.",4.0
"I bought this mouse refurbished from Amazon marketplace and it came in a condition that I would definitely call ""used.""  After cleaning it up a bit with some alcohol and a q-tip it looks good as new except for the bottom, where you can see scratches from when it was used on a rougher desktop.  I thought buying refurbished meant that they would replace the outer shell of the mouse, but in this case you're getting a used mouse that had its internals fixed (apparently).  You'll need to install the Logitech Gaming Software suite from their website, which was a pretty painless process overall.  The mouse was already updated to the latest firmware and the gaming software suite gives you a lot of customization options.

I have big hands, and while this thing feels small at first it's definitely very wide.  I found the g-shift key to be a pain to begin with, but I switched my profile to the one where the thumb keys mimic the num-pad keys and then I changed the g-shift key to my auto-loot/push-to-talk key.  Ever since then I've really liked having my push to talk key not take up one of my keyboard fingers or my thumb when I'm in the middle of a big fight in-game.

This thing is also fairly light compared to my old mouse, the RAT 7, and it glides really easily over my hard 3M mouse mat.  Too easily, in fact.  It makes it really hard to select stuff when pressing a mouse button wants to slide the whole mouse around.  I'm getting a more grippy, softer mouse mat to see if that makes a difference and I'll update my review when it gets here.

Overall, I still feel like I got a pretty solid deal and I don't know that I would want to go back to regular mouse for my MMO gaming.  If you're into MMOs like GW2 or WoW you'll definitely like it and the extra buttons it brings to your right hand, but just know that it's not perfect and it definitely takes some getting used to.",4.0
"I like the headset for the most part. I've never worn a headset or even over-the-ear headphones before so it's definitely something to get used to. I decided to pick up a headset because a long time friend of mine told me to get the video game Destiny and I needed to use voice chat to play with him. I find the cushioning may not be soft enough around the ears; it feels like a lot of pressure around some of the muscle/tissue. I also noticed my ears were getting sweaty after a while. I'm assuming this is just because I never wear anything around my ears though. When I press the cushioning with my hand it definitely feels quite soft. I tested them out with a 3D audio video on YouTube and I think they sound really good, almost like I didn't have anything on. I didn't like that it only came it a resealable plastic bag and not a box, but it's not that important. Another thing is that the description on the product page says that the 3.5mm plug is gold plated, but the plug coming directly from the headset is not. Only the mic/headphone splitter is gold plated.",4.0

"Love the customization, feel, wired or wireless, docking station, feel and customizations in this mouse. Before I had this I had a couple of Logitech G9s (one G9 and a G9x) and they both were good mice but this mouse is awesome. I miss some of the buttons that are available when I am working on other mice that do not have them. One thing I am still getting used to is the whole having to charge the mouse but it is awesome that they used a AA rechargeable for the battery so that when the battery eventually degrades I can just change out the battery with any store bought AA rechargeable. My one complaint that is keeping me from giving it a 5 star is the Razor Synapse on Windows (well 8.1 anyways). The software gets these little bugs that crop up every so often where it is uncontrollable and if I am luck it is just a shutting off of the software that fixes it but otherwise I can interface with the computer enough (given my keyboard is a Razor as well) to be able to do a graceful shutdown. So, if they would ever improve the software so there were less of these issues that would  be greatly appreciated but otherwise a fantastic mouse.",4.0

"Spider-Man has had a pretty good track record on the DS thus far, and Spider-Man: Web of Shadows is no different.  Using the same formula of 3-D character models on a 2-D side scrolling plane that the last few Spidey games on the DS have, Web of Shadows is a solid and fun, albeit short, ride that is fun while it lasts.  Symbiotes have taken over New York City, and naturally it's up to Spidey to take 'em all down.  You have the ability to play in either the classic costume or the black suit, which makes Spidey more powerful.  The game looks good and sounds great, and is simple enough for anyone to pick up and play.  The flaws of Web of Shadows on the DS are, as said before, that the game is quite short, so short in fact that you could easily finish it in one sitting.  There's also a little bit of backtracking involved that dulls down the gameplay, but as a whole, the game is a more than solid offering.  All in all, if you own a DS and are a Spidey fan, Spider-Man: Web of Shadows is most definitely worth checking out.",4.0
"I bought my Vita a couple of years ago before the price drop. It's an impressive machine with a beautiful screen. It fits comfortably in my hands and overall the gaming experience on it has been great.

There's just one problem: lack of games. I love this system, but when I bought the Assasin's Creed bundle I didn't play much of the included game. Not my cup of tea but it was cheaper than getting a standalone unit. I've purchased Persona 4 and played the crap out of it off and on over the past couple of years, but that's the only Vita game that I've actually gone out and purchased.

Other than that it's a nostalgia machine loaded down with original Playstation games to be enjoyed on the go. It's great for that, don't get me wrong, and having all of my favorite PS RPGs in one convenient and portable spot is wonderful. I just wish there were more games for this system that weren't rehashes of games from other systems. This system is wonderful but lacking any sort of killer app to make it essential.",4.0
"If you're a hardcore Guitar Hero fan, it's a no brainer. Stop thinking and put away those cheap plastic controllers and get this! I also have this guitar for the PS3. Personally, I love it in all black, but other than that, the build quality and feel is the same. However, for the Wii, the Wii controller connects inside the guitar and the navigation is an analog joystick as opposed to a d-pad. It's more convenient for the Wii because you just connect the controller and go. For the PS3, it needs to connect a USB dongle to the console.

As I mentioned in my PS3 guitar review, the strum bar is not really ""quiet as a whisper"". There is still a distinct sound when strumming; however, some may prefer that than not hearing anything like on the Rock Band controller. Overall, this high quality guitar definitely makes playing Guitar Hero a lot more fun. It's really hard to go back to the cheap guitars once you've been spoiled with this guitar.",4.0

"Bought this game as a farewell of sorts since I don't see myself lasting with GH/RB past this title. It's got pretty much every great song you can think of from the past GH games if you're a long time GH player. The older charts have been updated to be either easier or more difficult and its all for the better. Along with the arpeggio sections added in GH:WT, this one makes very strong use of ringing notes. A big thing to look out for on the PS2 version is that the load times (to me) are awful. I counted the load times for loading a song as anywhere from 1 minute to a minute and a half. Compared to next gen hardware (PS3, 360, Wii), and all the stuff they crammed into this one disc (guitar, bass, vocals, drums), the load times become acceptable. I also don't like that it saves after you turn on progressive scan; another useless 30 seconds, especially when you have to turn it on EVERY time you boot up the disc. Online multiplayer was not a selling point for me so the $20 difference to not get it on 360 was worth it to me. I'm happy with my choice, the pros of this game far outweigh the cons.",4.0
good game,4.0
"Let me start by saying two things:

1) When one of the ""new features"" listed is ""Tracks handpicked by SPIN magazine, featuring Cool Kids, Skrillex, The Joy Formidable, Grouplove, My Morning Jacket and more"", I think it's safe to say that it's a slow year for new features.  (I have never heard of any of the bands...and who buys a PC sports game because of the soundtrack anyway?)

2) If you are a PC gamer and you want a 2012 baseball game, stop reading now, go back, and hit the ""order"" button.  It's not the greatest PC game of all time but it's certainly worth $30 if  you are a PC baseball fan.

Okay, so now to the review.  Let me start with the ""new features"".  (Most of the game is very similar to last year's version, which is not necessarily a bad thing: I liked last year's version for the most part).

*MLB Today Season Mode - looks cool, but a little too early to review this since the season hasn't started.  The concept is definitely exciting.

*Dynamic Tendency System - in the course of my 8-9 games played, I haven't really noticed this yet.  Of course, when I'm pitching, I always try to mix it up (location, speed, pitch type) so I may not be the target audience for this.

*New Throw Meter - Ugh.  So...I understand what they were trying to do: make fielding more realistic.  If you field a ball on the run, do you wait a second to set your feet or do you just fling it off-balance and hope for the best?  Unfortunately, the implementation is pretty hit-or-miss.  In one game where the CPU was fielding for me (I was the pitcher in My Player mode), my 2nd baseman fielded a routine ground ball...went through about a 5-second exaggerated throwing animation that looked like he was trying to wrap his arms around himself 12 times...and by the time he actually threw the ball, the hitter was safe by a mile.  This was a routine ground ball to 2nd base, where the hitter should have been out by about 30 feet.  I say again: ugh.  I don't have a problem with more realistic fielding, but this is NOT more realistic fielding.  The animations are sometimes forced at the expense of realistic baseball logic, and that is just unacceptable.

*Improved My Player Mode - In my opinion, this is the whole reason to play 2K baseball games.  This is where I spend about 80% of my time.  I've already created one pitcher and one hitter and I'll probably create more because this year, it's easier to specialize.  You can select your ""player type"" and depending on what you select, you get extra bonuses in certain areas.  (So if you select ""speedster"" you get more speed and acceleration, etc).  Is it a little harder to create a 5-tool monster?  Yep.  But how many 5-tool monsters are there in MLB?  A handful?  99.9% of all the players are specialists of one sort or another.  I kind of like the idea of creating a speedy leadoff hitter, and then tomorrow creating a hulking slugger.  Maybe I'll try to bump up my speedster's power at some point...maybe I'll try to increase my slugger's speed rating...but maybe not, and that's okay.  It is a LOT of fun taking a youngster up from AA ball to the majors and then trying to carve out a Hall of Fame career.

*Soundtrack - uh...as I mentioned, when ""soundtrack"" is one of your main ""new features"", it is a slow year for new features.

What's weird is that there is actually a new feature that is not listed as a new feature: the play-by-play and color commentary.  It's MUCH better this year.  Do they still have trouble staying on topic?  Sure.  Are they sometimes repetitive?  Sure.  But most of the time, it almost sounds like an actual play-by-play guy and an actual color guy doing an actual MLB game.

All in all, MLB 2k12 is a solid effort and I look forward to playing throughout the baseball season.",4.0

"I absolutely adored this game, it was one that kept me interested and challenged me to an extent that I thought I might give up. I loved this game but I did have a few minor issues with it. At first I bought the game just because it looked very intriguing I was beyond astounded on the graphics on the cover I thought ""Wow this game will probably suck with the graphics at an all high"" I started playing and noticed how I am such an enormous fan of puzzle strategy games! This game I played it for 2 days straight and beat it finished it. I hated the ending of the game, it was sort of a cliff hanger for me and I can't wait for the sequel.

Now I won't suggest this game to people who are very impatient or people who don't like a decent challenge. This game irritated me a few times for the puzzles can be very difficult to understand if you don't have an ounce of sophistication in yourself. Some people decided to use things like a walk-through [Which I will honestly say I did a few times but very little] but if you like to be challenged [and I do mean challenged some parts of this game can be very hard] then this is definitely the game for you.

This game was a bit short for me. This is one of the main things I would like to complain about. This game had a magnificent plot and the graphics stunned me. It can get a bit boring and cliche at times but overall it was good. If it was a bit longer I'd be magnificently jubilant, And overall completely satisfied.

Now for the reason I was disappointed, I didn't even bother to read the back or anything before buying it for that manner, because I thought I was going to play as the oh so magnificent D r a c u l a. This was not the case. You play as Dr. Abraham Van Helsing it was an alright journey with him but his voice irritated me to the point where I thought I would rip out my hair. His voice sounds stale to me but it isn't much of a bother after about an hour.

This game you have to think with but it's worth the money. I got this game at wall-mart expecting something incredibly stupid and got out of it a world where Dracula was the worlds worst nightmare and where it was Van Helsing's duty to stop the Vampire.

If you didn't like this game try the sequel, you get to play as Dracula next<3;

"If you already own a copy of this game for a home console then let me tell you that you won't find anything new here (other than the fact this version is portable.) Some backgrounds are fairly dynamic with fireworks exploding in the distance or aircraft flying around while other stages are almost completely static.

The controls for this game are simply superb on the Vita. I have no problems pulling off special moves of my favorite characters and battles are frantic and fun. As I write this review there are not very many people in the US who have Vitas but I still found lots of people to play against online. There is also an ad-hoc mode so you can play against people you meet in person but I have not had an opportunity to test that yet.

Capcom decided to support the Vita's touchscreen capabilities by adding a ""Touch mode."" You swipe your finger across your character to move and tap on the enemy to attack. This honestly isn't very much fun to me so I disable this feature when I play online.

In my opinion, this is a very good game to start building your Vita libraries especially if you do not yet have this game for the home consoles. Those of you who are into collecting trophies will be pleased to to know that this game offers a completely different set of trophies but the conditions for earning them are mostly the same as the PS3 version. That means this game will have you playing for a while if you want that platinum.",4.0

"We just finished playing this game and overall, we enjoyed it quite a bit.

First, we should warn that there were some technical issues with the game. At one point in the middle of the game it started refusing to save, and we needed to update all of our drivers and run the game from the disc once in order to get it to save again. So, we would highly recommend installing all patches and updating all drivers before beginning to play.

Once we had gotten past the technical issues, however, the game was quite enjoyable.

The design of the game was  beautiful. There were several interesting locations which were all designed with a great deal of detail. The plot was cohesive and coherent and we found the ending satisfying, unlike many games we've recently played.

The atmosphere of the game was dark and a bit creepy and squeamish people should note that there are several images of dead bodies and blood. However, those who are looking for a proper horror game should look elsewhere. The atmosphere was gothic, but the game was never really scary (unlike games like Barrow Hill, Dark Fall etc.). Also, you can't die in the game, which we like, but some people might see as a disadvantage.

In terms of game play, the controls were comfortable and convinient, with none of the newfangled attempts at ""innovation"" that usually fail appallingly. It was 3rd person, no 360 panning and all that. In terms of design and controls it was quite similar to the Sherlock Holmes games.

The game was somewhat linear, in the sense that you couldn't really move forward until you had done everything you needed to do. However, it was much much less linear than some games we have played recently (again, the Sherlock Holmes games come to mind). It's not one of those annoying games where you can't pick something up until you know why you need it.

We found the game challenging and the puzzles sufficiently interesting and diverse. It was nice that some puzzles required inventory items while other were pure logic.
For the most part the puzzles were logical and we didn't find ourselves using hints or walkthroughs very often (and when we did, mostly just because we were impatient). There were a few situations where items required a bit of pixel hunting, but this was not too horrible, because of the space-bar feature that allows you to see active areas.

Per our taste, we would have liked the game to be a little bit longer, but it still took us a few weekends to get through it, so it was good value for money.

Overall when comparing it to games we've played recently, we think it's better than the Sherlock Holmes games (which we overall enjoyed but found too linear) but is not as good as The Longest Journey or Syberia.",4.0

"As you may already know Black ops games have 3 modes so i will be reviewing each separate then giving my overall thoughts.

Campaign 4.5/5: this is hands down the best COD campaign ever. while modern warefare 1 and 2 and even the original black ops had great campaigns this is even better than those. the story shifts between cold war era and the future. the future is similar to modern warfare but just a little more high tech. the story is great and will keep you interested enough to beat the campaign. Your ending can be 1 of 4 based on choices you make during the campaign giving you reason to do multiple replays or simply watch all the other endings on youtube. there are strike force missons which play like RTS games but i skipped them.

Multiplayer 3.9/5: The biggest problem with multiplayer is the maps. while theres a good amount of maps there are only a handful of good ones. all the maps are made like mw3 and not black ops 1. that means camper heaven and the other huge downside is one side of the map tends to be better giving the team who spawns there a huge advantage. this can be downright frustrating when playing objective based matches. the guns are ok but no returning favorites from black ops 1. i wanted a futuristic galil so bad. oh well.

Zombies 5/5: this is the best part of black ops 2 and the main reason i bought the game. the new zombies is all about innovation while sticking to its roots much like what the other COD's claim they do. there are 3 modes with 1 large map and 3 small maps.
Tranzit: tranzit is basically the main map or mode of zombies. it feels just like the older games maps but of course adds a bus you can travel to 5 destinations with. you cannot control the bus but sped up or slow down the time when it leaves. the only map with tranzit so far is green run.
Green run (Tranzit only): green run has 5 stops. from the bus stop to the diner to the farm to the power plant to the town you will basically play zombies by defeating waves of zombies. however your old strategys from the old maps will not work as well. the mystery box( box where you can buy a random gun) moves to different stops once its used up making you rethink when you have to stay or go to the next stop.
Survival: classic gameplay with no stops or bus.
bus depot (part of tranzit): the bus depot is small. smaller than the first zombies map ever. its the first stop in tranzit too. since the map is small the mystery box never moves. its a very hard and challenging map.
farm: a farm and is the second largrest survival map. it too doesnt have a moving box.
town: the largest survival map which is a little bigger than the first map ever made. it has a pack a punch machine and is the only place you can pack a punch other than tranzit mode.
GRIEF: Zombies has its own take on multiplayer and you bassically have to outlast another team of 4 players. only town and farm are playable with grief but bus depot is through a glitch somehow.

Overall: with a great campaign, decent multiplayer, and new and improved zombies BO2 offers alot.",4.0
"This game is awsome. You really get a sense of speed because of the sounds of the engine. I don't think the graphics could be really any better. The cars are ones that you could probably just see on the road if you went to the grocery store right now, but I think that's an awsome part of this game. So, if the game is so great, why only 4 stars? Well, thats because I could do without the license mode and you have to go through too many races with a car that isn't very good at all before you can get a car like a Mustang SVT Cobra. But thats ok, because all the rest of this game is sweet. So i highly reccomend to get this game. Its the best game I own for PS2 and i have like 8 of them.

Not that I have played it, but seeing the first Bloodrayne's success, I would think it would be similar to Resident Evil for the zombie concepts, Matrix for It's slow motion,and Buffy the vampire slayer for it's vampire history. I am definately going to buy this game first hand and other readers and Bloodrayne fans should too. It's education isn't that good, but it'll teach a lesson or two about not to stick your nose into other people's bussiness.",4.0
"Pros:
- Fast-paced continuation of story from the first game and good plot twists. Despite the success of the first game, very, very few developers have explored mythology to this extent for game content, which is a shame.
- New weapons, updated weapons, and weapon combos offer huge amounts of action. You feel like you can do pretty much anything with the weapons Kratos has.
- Multi-dimensional puzzles and platform style gameplay inject lots of variety into the game.
- Good mix of story, action, and puzzles keeps the game fresh.
- Nice unlockable content adds some replay value to the game.
- Enormous sense of scale makes the game all the more larger-than-life.
- Proves that the PS2 can still deliver the goods graphics-wise, and makes me question why it took developers so long to deliver games on DVD format when the PS2 supported DVD format at its launch 7 years ago.

Cons:
- Camera Angles: I think they're worse than the first game. Found myself on numerous levels getting behind monsters and enemies and not being able to see what was happening. Camera isn't dynamic enough and doesn't change viewpoint very easily. You will be attacked by enemies off-screen because the camera doesn't adjust properly, a no-no in modern games.
- The game's very short. About equal to the first one, maybe a bit longer even, but short nonetheless. It's on DVD, and yet the game is as short as it is, and there's little excuse for that. Like I said about the first game, if you have the resources to put all sorts of ""making of"" material in the game packaging, then you have plenty of resources to make the game more than what was delivered, and just didn't do it.
- Some save problems, but not enough to totally ruin the experience. Save points are plentiful, so it balances out somewhat.

All in all, an excellent continuation of the Kratos vs. the Greek Gods vs. the Greek Titans saga. Once again, parents should take the rating very seriously. The game is violent, as in rip body parts off of bad guys and beat them with same violent, and there are a lot of mature themes in the game. Kratos does some morally questionable things to move the story along, and he's the standard to which all flawed ""good"" guys will be measured. Parents, you have been warned, by me *and the box label*. 'Nuff said...

I'd like to see more branching storyline, but that's just me. This game series has the potential for it without drowning action-oriented gamers into the minutiae of RPG-style games, or making people pull out the flow charts to remember what happened where and when. Here's hoping God of War III (me thinks there will be a sequel) on the PS3 takes advantage of all that processing power for gameplay additions and enhancements. Developers get a bit caught up in the eye-candy aspect and forget that all that CPU power can be used to branch the storyline out, too.

While there are a lot of similarities to Grand Theft Auto and this game there are some very destinct differences which make it just as fun to play and not feel like you've done it all before. The main difference is you have moral choices...in GTA you can mow people down in your car and just have to deal with the cops for a bit...but in this game it hurts your reputation. This isn't that big of a deal however the game treats you differently if you are playing on the good side or bad side. Also the hacking is the other big difference. It changes the games play a lot. I find myself wanting to be able to change the streetlights while in a high speed chase now when I play GTA5. Visually the game is great looking but isn't a must buy on the xbox one. From what I saw it looks best on Xbox One/PS4 but the WiiU is very close as is the 360/PS3 so if you don't have a new system yet and think you should hold out til then it isn't that big of a deal...its still the same game no matter what. The storyline is riviting and it makes you connect with Adrian where I don't always get that with a GTA character as they aren't usually sympathetic. The controls were easy to pick up; however the driving is where this game is weakest. Compared to GTA the driving is way to loose. I find myself always trying to find the crappiest cars just so i could stay on the road when chasing people.,4.0

"Everyone knows why the Nintendo Wii is so different and that is mostly due to having to stand up and play and not just sit on the couch. I don't use the nunchuk very often, but when you do it's a lot different using both hands to play a boxing game and it's pretty realistic to throw punches with both hands, cause that's the way boxing games should be played.",4.0
"We picked up ""Halo: Combat Evolved"" right after we got our XBox 360 because my son wanted to start at the beginning of the Halo series. This is a fairly fun shooter that has spawned at least five additional games and even a fairly well written series of books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halo-Books-1-3-The-Flood-First-Strike-The-Fall-of-Reach/dp/0345473043/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halo, Books 1-3 (The Flood; First Strike; The Fall of Reach)</a>, which were actually fairly good and follow this game's plot line closely).

You are controlling ""The Master Chief"", a heavily armored and physically augmented ""Spartan"" super soldier. The various missions range rescuing a computer Artificial Intelligence to destroying important ancient relics, all the while battling hordes of ""Covenent"" soldiers (a large variety of species) and the creepy ""Flood"" (very menacing opponents, indeed).

After many hours of game play, here are my observations:

Great Storyline; very involved and engaging
Intuitive Controls; easy to learn and well thought out
OK Replay Value; changing the difficulty settings provides increased challenges
Graphics; good but not great by newer game standards
Two Player Mode; very fun, but the split-screen is a little confusing for me follow

While not critical to the enjoyment of the later games, it does provide the events that they build on and it is also fun to play.

Recommended!

"This is and probably will be the best Simpsons game of all time. There's a lot of cars to drive and levels to complete. Every level you get to use a different character. It also loads somewhat faster than Simpsons Road Rage. You can get in and out of your car when you like, and in addition can also kick and jump. Although it is a cartoon, the graphics are probably as good as they come. If you are a fan of Road Rage, you will love Simpson's Hit and Run.",4.0
"Graphics in this game are nicely done.
They are a bit on the cartoon style side but nevertheless they are excellent.
I love the apocalyptic setting of this game with the ruined cities and buildings.
That why I bought this game in the first place.
The sounds in this game are nicely done as well with music scores and detailed background noises.

The game AI consists of soldiers and some mechanized units.
The soldier's actions are very nicely programmed and realistic. The taunts and dialog of the soldiers directed at the player is awesome.

The controls of the main character is a bionic arm which takes a bit of learning to master. Nothing that is too hard but does takes some practice.

I really had fun playing this game.",4.0
"For the price you are getting a really good game. I would not go as far as to say it's a great game but it is worth the price.

The game really gave me an Uncharted vibe, that is not to say it is as good as the Uncharted games but few games are. There is a good amount jumping and climbing and that part of the game plays very much like Uncharted.

As for the combat style it is more melee using a staff which was kinda of a nice change of pace with so many shooters out there. The story is pretty good and the graphics are great. All and all I would recommend the game.",4.0
Good mouse. Took a while to get used to the feel. Doesn't have the ability to unlock the scroll wheel so it can free-spin. I miss that feature. A little too light in weight for my tastes but really if you aren't super picky like me you won't go wrong buying it.,4.0
"I absolutely adored this game. Yes, it was short, but frankly that isn't quite the game breaker a lot of people claim it is. Due to it's length is $60 too much to pay for this game? Well, maybe. However, it doesn't make it quite the worthless game people pretend it is. The sad thing about the internet is that it's full of people that use the internet, and they typically tend to have a herd mentality. It's unfortunate that this game is the victim of more manufactured and artificial internet outrage. Honestly I wonder how many of these people complaining have actually played it and how many are just regurgitating complaints they've seen on the internet without trying it themselves. Thankfully I decided to give it a shot myself and thought it was a good effort.

Maybe this is a bit of a short experience for a console game, and waiting for a price drop may not be a bad idea. However, there are a lot of good things I have to say about the game.

First, let's start with the quick time events. The only thing I have to say about the number of QTE's in this game is so what? Seriously, so what? How is that a weakness? Sure, you can say it's because every game does this nowadays, but the reason so many games do it is it keeps you alert during the cut scenes. Really, it's not that big of a deal, and anyone that pretends that the fact you have to press a button every now and then is being way too nit-picky.

The story is a bit dry at times. Frankly, I think this game takes itself way too seriously. By the looks of it you would thing people in the 19th century didn't have a sense of humor. While this game was never intended to be a comedy, I get that, it could have lightened up a bit more to give the characters a bit more flavor. That aside the story is a really good one, and frankly I enjoyed it.

The controls on this game are really responsive and fluid. The level designs are gorgeous and the designers did a great job of reinventing late 19th century London. Seriously, it really puts you in the world and makes you feel like you're actually living in it.

My final verdict: I hope this game does get a sequel and does fix the problems it had. No, I don't think these issues were quite the deal breaker a lot of the internet thinks it was, but clearly this game has room for improvement but the franchise has a lot of potential.",4.0

"I picked this up way back when it came out. I played it then and at that time, I did feel the graphics were not the best but nothing to be upset over. The gameplay took some getting used to. People who are a run and gun lover, will not like this. You have to plan out your entry, tactics (yours and your teams), etc. This is a thinking man's game. The less lethal you are, the more rewarded you are. This sounds less fun but the challenge of it actually was entertaining and putting a shot from a riot gun into someones gut and watching him roll around on the floor never gets old.
The other day, I was installing some older games on my old laptop for traveling and next to Ravenshield and No One Lives Forever 2, this was #3. It is a must have for old school shooter fans that would like a little challenge. As for the AI, I have played games made recently that had aweful AI. The AI in this is not bad at all. Enemies will not be in the same place each time you play the game. You will think you cleared the floor and there is one guy hiding in a closet that you have to secure before completing so you start clearing rooms frantically to find him. He may have circled back to the entrance waiting for your team? Who knows.",4.0

she absolutely loves it and spends most of her time over at my house playing it...so i figured i would write a review...

she said that the game deserves 5 stars for fun but the game overall could use a couple improvements (as any game can) and so she said that for overall she would give it a 4

this game is great for anyone who likes a ""calm"" game to play with objectives and fun little things to do when you're not completing tasks (things like fishing, prospecting-basically walking around with a metal detector type thing, talking to people, planting trees and taking care of them, collecting objects, building all kinds of things, etc)...great for people of all ages",4.0
"As there are only a handful of shooters on the Wii designed for use with the new zapper it is hard to really split hairs.  This is an ARCADE light gun game that doesn't deliver the big storyline gameplay length and arc that many gamers have come to expect from shooters instead GHOST SQUAD takes its ARCADE origins and puts them in your living room like VIRTUA COP on the Saturn before it.  The zapper feels good as snapping offscreen to reload doesn't diorient as much as it does in some LG games.
The reticle is accurate and is just sensitive enough for the games Sniper scenes.

Now the stages themselves aren't really that hard, it's the fact that if you fail the level (hitting the red ""!"" circles or running out of time), you can't just instantly go replay.

"GO has the making of a great game. For the most part, it is. What can hold it back is the rough graphics and sometimes confusing gameplay. I liked the overall setup of classes and weapons.
The weapons all have their strengths, limitations, handle differently and with enough cash you can add scopes, extra ammo, silencers, etc. This is a neat feature that can really add to what your gun of choice is capable of. On the other hand, what is the point of a silencer if they already know where you are? Or a laser sight that gives away your location? I do think that they all sound good. The machine guns make a nice throaty roar while SMGs make a nice hard tapping sound. They all sound like they should and sound good.
Like the weapons, each class has strengths and limitations that help focus the team based combat. A recon trooper moves forward to light up enemies while a pair of heavy gunners provides cover fire for example. While this sounds good in theory, actually getting other people to do this is rare. More often than not it brakes down in to a free for all until the match expires or someone manages to meet an objective. Coordination is compounded by the vague voice commands and lack of a map to location posistions.
The graphics should have been better. The player models are many and varied but it seems they shot for quantity over quality. The models are bland and crudely shaped with stiff animations. The lighting is generally good, but player shadows are simple and look tacked on. At least most of the texturing is good enough and the flash from weapons or smoke from grenades look good.
Most of that I could overlook but for one thing. It is not always easy to tell if the player in the distance is on your team or not. This sounds so simple but it can be confusing. More so if you are switched teams by the game at the end of the round. In the ""Mexico"" map for example, the good guys wear flat drab green and the bad guys wear drab green and tan cammo. At a distance this it can be hard to distinguish one green pixel from another. And the models look close enough alike that in the shadows it gets worse. In some maps it is easy to tell, other not so much. This inconsistent style it irritating as you might fire at your teammates. Or wait to see whom it is and get killed.
All that said it has it moments, and is usually enjoyable enough. But it could have been better.",4.0
"I'll be the first to admit that I bought in to the pregame hype surrounding Return to Castle Wolfenstein's release.  When the developers released their ""Storm the Beaches of Normandy"" level as a free multiplayer demo, they released what was probably one of the funnest online action multiplayer levels ever.  While the new multiplayer levels included in the full version do not disappoint, after playing them for some time, they don't seem to have the same replay value as the beach demo that was released.
Return to Castle Wolfenstein surrounds a WWII theme of Nazis and the occult.  It comes with two versions: single player and multiplayer.  The singler player version is an adventure in the mold of Indiana Jones and your solo American G.I. must battle Nazis, zombies and witches.  The single player version has various missions with different objectives.  In one mission, you must eliminate a specific person, in the next you must infiltrate a Nazi compound while not being detected and in another you can find yourself searching for a lost archaelogical relic that will prevent the Nazis from obtaining power.  The single player missions are great fun and there are many weapons that are aquired throughout the levels with more lethal weapons available in the later levels.  Impressive weapons such as several sniper rifles, flamethrowers and a few others either invented by the programmers or in theme with the WWII atmosphere.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein allows fun gameplay elements such as sneaking up on Nazis in the middle of top secret conversations or fighting your way through levels with a knife to avoid making noises that will alert other guards.  Probably the biggest complaint I have about the single player levels is that there aren't many included on the CD and it's over before you know it.
The second version available in Return to Castle Wolfenstein is the multiplayer mode and it comes with eight maps that you can play via the internet with other gamers.  The best thing about Return to Castle Wolfenstein's multiplayer mode is the teamwork required.  Most team formats in FPS games have the same type of soldiers with the same weapons available for all players. Not so in Return to Castle Wolfenstein. You must pick a class of soldier to play (soldier, lieutenant, medic and engineer) which reflects the weapons you are permitted and the special abilities you can use. Some classes start with more ammunition. Each class has a specific function in the multiplayer map you pick and must be used in unison with other players and their chosen classes to complete the team's objectives. While medics might be reviving fallen comrades, lieutenants can call airstrikes on enemy positions, soldiers can use flamethrowers to sniff out enemy bunkers, engineers arm dynamite to blow up strategic walls, etc...
If the price of Return to Castle Wolfenstein was lower, I'd give it five stars in a heartbeat.  Unfortunately, the price was set by the game's developers to reflect the instant demand for a game hyped such as this.  Amazon. Com is actually one of the cheaper sources for Wolfenstein as I've seen retail stores that charge as high as sixty dollars for this long awaited sequel.
The price shouldn't be an issue though if the game's developers follow through with some of their promises to release many more multiplayer maps and an official map editor that will allow gamers to create their own maps.  Already, websites have started releasing utilities for this game and it looks like it will have a healthy amount of mods (Modifications that either create or change new levels and gameplay elements.), new mulitplayer maps and other creative programs developed by fans around the world.
Not a poor game by any means but I think PC gamers were expecting a little bit more for the price.  If you haven't done it already, download the free multiplayer demo available on the internet to see how fun the gameplay can be.  A game that is fun and entertaining and promises to be much more after the developers and fans have created many more new features for it.",4.0

"Fire Emblem started 18 years ago in Japan; when we got our first game of the franchise it was already well over a decade old. By the time we got to experience one of the greatest strategy games ever made, Intelligent Systems had had plenty of time to develop their ability to write a superb story, build up memorable characters, and work with the accessible but deep gameplay. Shadow Dragon is a remake of the 18-year-old game that started the franchise back in the NES days, giving fans of the series a chance to see how it all began. It's obvious that Shadow Dragon is the first in the series with its somewhat shallow nature, but despite that it's still a solid and enjoyable game.

Marth, who we were introduced to in Super Smash Bros. Melee, is the main character in Shadow Dragon. A former ally betrays his country, leaving the king dead and the land ruined. Marth escapes to a safe place where he stays until he is grown, and once he is old enough he gathers troops to regain his country and the entire continent, and save the world from the evil Shadow Dragon Medeus.

While the tale's premise is cool, Shadow Dragon's story is really quite shallow and disappointing. There appears to be no difference between it and the dialogue from the NES original, because it feels totally stripped of significance and a reason to care about what happens next. The entire story revolves around Marth being told to go capture this place or save this person, and the dialogue in between doesn't involve Marth nearly as much as it should. The other characters are nonexistent in the story after they are introduced, too, which is a big letdown and takes away almost all the strength the other Fire Emblem games have in story. Shadow Dragon shows its age in its story, and it makes for a lackluster adventure 18 years later.

Thankfully, the rest of the game is more solid than the story. The outstanding feature of Shadow Dragon is its turn based strategy gameplay, which is accessible while still being deep and leaving you with a lot to come back to. You take turns with your opposing army, moving each of your characters on the grid and attacking your enemies. Battles are decided by a basic rock-paper-scissors method of hit chances while using the characters' statistics such as strength, defense, and the like. Despite the fact that you are leaving the battles to chance, the game still involves a lot of skill in its strategy and how you use your characters. Fire Emblem has always been very good at this and it still is.

The units at your disposal are very diverse, and within each one you can change their class between battles if you want. This gives you the chance to fully customize your team and find where a certain character fights best. There are also quite a few weapons at your disposal, but not as many as recent games in the series have had. You are able to customize weapons, though, which is a really worthwhile feature and makes up for the lack of variation.

Shadow Dragon is the first game in the series to feature online play, and this is one of the best parts of the game. You are allowed to form a squad of any five units from one of your save files and use any weapons you have to fight against other people over Wi-Fi, and this is one of the biggest inspirations to replay the game. There is also an online shop that has great weapons and is very useful for playing through the story and forming a good online team. The online play is a great addition to the game, and offers a good reason to come back to Shadow Dragon.

To characterize Shadow Dragon as a DS game, it features touch screen controls as an option for those players who dislike the use of buttons. This control scheme is actually quite good and functions almost as well as the good old fashioned way. I use the normal controls because I've played enough Fire Emblem to the point where I move along at a very rapid pace, but the touch controls are good for newcomers or those who are intimidated by buttons (I don't know why you would be, as the normal controls are simple enough, but you never know...).

Shadow Dragon's graphics are an interesting mix of 2-D and 3-D. The map is shown in normal 2-D, like an enhanced verison of the GBA games. The battles have 3-D characters fighting on 2-D backdrops, which doesn't look half bad. The character models look pretty good, and they are always moving slightly to make them more lifelike. The fights, like on the GBA, aren't the most interesting things in the world, so being able to skip them by pressing start is a welcome option. Of course, you can always just turn them off too.

Shadow Dragon does a pretty good job in the sound department. The music is well done and sounds pretty good, and although the tracks aren't as memorable as in previous games they're still fitting to the situations and environments. The sound effects are good as well, with sounds like the clanking of armor or galloping of horses sounding nice and clear.

To sum it all up, Shadow Dragon is a great game that could have been better. Although I have never played the NES original I can tell there isn't much improvement here in some areas, namely that of story and weapon variety. However, the addition of online play and update in graphics are great, making the game look like it's from this decade at least on the outside. Despite its shortcomings, Shadow Dragon is still well worth a purchase for fans, and with online play and six difficulty levels there is a lot of value within the little game card.

Positive:
+ Fire Emblem gameplay is as solid and outstanding as ever
+ online play is fun and adds lots of value
+ six difficulty levels offer great challenges and more play time
+ touch controls work very well
+ you can make a unit whatever class you want

Negative:

"This is perhaps one of the best beat-em-ups that the PS2 has to offer.  In some ways, that's saying a lot (the controls are responsive and decently tailored to the environments, the combos are relatively interesting, and there is decent weapon variety) and not that much.
Honestly, this game is all about hack and slash and kill the monsters; it doesn't pretend to be otherwise.  There is little plot to speak of, but the monsters have interesting designs and the attacks based on what weapons you have equipped are quite amusing.
Where DMC really falls down is the camera.  I was tearing out my hair most of the time because, even though a camera angle may be good for being cinematic, it probably STINKS for gameplay.  That and some overly annoying boss-battles and supremely difficult ""secret missions"" make it a bit less than perfect.

You are in different seasons of the year and will find yourself in snow, sailing on a ship, etc. and jumping for icicles, hot cocoa mugs, etc.,  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I finished it within about 6 -8 hours.

"I gave the N64 version of this classic wrestling title 4 stars because this version of the game unlike it's PS1 cousin has very smooth graphics, shorter wait/loading times, and the overall presentation flows better. I don't have to worry about lag like I do with the disc. The default controls were a little hard to pick up on but once you find out what buttons do what, you're pretty much good to go. This version has the same amount of wrestlers in it as the PS1, same every thing. I'm very glad to have found this version of the game.

"Apparently some of these reviewers thought this was gonna be some new and improved or completely original take on Sid Meier's civ games.  No.  This is a console version of a great PC game.  As such one has to expect some differences.  That doesn't mean, however, that this game doesn't include all the aspects that make up a CIV game.  But I would say, if you like the computer version stick to that, if you're looking for something a little different, read on.

To answer another reviewers question, ""Why was this game made?""

As someone who always found Civilization games extremely massive, confusing, time-consuming, difficult to navigate, and impossible to grasp completely - THIS IS OUR SALVATION!!!!  All the fun of the Civilization franchise in a simple, intuitive, easy to learn, addictive, and yet still complex console game.  The graphics are beautiful (in the civilization's own cartoony way), the game has tons of replay-ability, and the setup/interface is so well designed that I actually quickly learned about elements of the game that I never even realized were a part of the old pc versions.

In my opinion... it's the way the Civilization games should have been designed since the very beginning.

"The Neverwinter Nights (NWN) game engine represents what I hope to be a new era in computer gaming: platforms that invite users/players to create their own games with near-complete access to the game engine.
Sadly, while the NWN platform itself was a major breakthrough, the included gameplay was routine, uninspired, and sometimes even silly. Shadows of Undrentide (SoA) shows that the Bioware crew can not only create a great technical product, but also deliver a solid story.
Unlike the original NWN storyline, SoA has a coherent plot that, while short of ""compelling,"" kept me interested. The fact that it was written for single-player mode meant the storytellers could focus on developing non-player characters rather than try to have the story work with lots of different players (not an easy task!). While many have complained about the lack of multi-player support, personally I've been unable to commit to that kind of gameplay anyway, and the few experience I've had were disappointing.
The fact that NWN is both a generalized toolset and a game means a lot of tradeoffs: one is that the graphics and environments become pretty uninspiring after a while because they re-use the same assets over and over again. To me, this is almost a blessing, as it forces story developers to focus more on the story rather than dazzle players with graphics.
Toolset enhancements and expanded assets (monsters, spells, etc.) make this expansion essential for those of us creating content.
Although not approaching the peaks of the Infinity Engine series of games, the NWN platform still has a lot of room for growth, whatever the power-gamers who want shiny graphics instead of good stories might say.",4.0

"We reached the end of the ""Arkham"" Trilogy and Rocksteady is pulling out all the stops! Unfortunately however effort alone isn't what makes a game great.

Without giving away spoilers I will discuss some pros and cons of the game and explain why ultimately I am giving it the WEAKEST of 4 stars.

Pros
- Rocksteady did their homework. Riddler challenges that rely on a lot of Bat History is a cool plus for a die hard Batman fan like myself. However this can be challenging and or frustrating for fans who only are casual Batman fans.

- Terrific voice acting. Batman sounds the same as he does back when Conroy was still doing BTAS, Scarecrow sounds creepy and menacing, and Troy Baker. I don't even need to explain anything there. However my one complaint was Gordon. Although I do love Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, I felt Gordon's voice did not match the character but that may just be my personal preference.

- The Villians. Another surprise was the use of not only well established villains but more recent and comic book entries. Apart from the typical two-face and penguin we are also treated to some surprise villains during the ""Gothams Most Wanted"" missions which I love how Rocksteady interpreted them into the Arkham Universe.

Cons

Annoying Riddler Challanges- It was the final game. I didn't want to just see the secret ending on YouTube, I wanted to earn it. I was wrong.... For all the trouble I went through the ending was just not that special to justify the frustration I went through. At the end of it all I was hoping Batman would break his rule and Kill Riddler, kidding (sorta...). Which brings me again to The Riddler...

-Riddler Batmobile races. Like I said before I wanted to personally murder the Riddler when the game was completed and his Challanges involving you racing against the clock only furthered that anger. I was lucky I managed to complete even the hardest of the races after a few tries but there are people on YouTube still stuck trying to beat certain Riddler races.

- Arkham Knight. I promised there would be no spoilers and I intend to keep my word. However with that being said, the reveal of Arkham Knight is not only anti climatic but underwhelming. I understood why they chose who they did and honestly I don't think I could have picked someone better, but still. It's resolution is clunky and quick.

Mixed bag

The God Damn Batmobile (Points if you get the reference) - Ok so at first I hated it. Clunky hard to drive, hard to turn, just not the best driving experience. I admit I got used to it and did enjoy it later on in the game. But I prefer soaring over Gotham, and grappling up buildings. Being forced to do so many Challanges with the car was not only annoying but could be frustrating when just starting out

Remember everything from the previous games? Well you better hope so because Rocksteady decided to just give you all your cool toys at the beginning of the game and hope you remembered how to use them. I discussed this with a friend who also agreed this tactic makes the game feel slightly rushed. I enjoyed the previous iterations where Batman had to get each weapon over time, instead the game is more focused on Batmobile upgrades.

So there you have it the pros and the cons, while its a good game it's not the best in the series. Personally it would be City, Asylum, then Knight for me. The game reminded me a lot of Dark Knight Rises which isn't the best thing in the world but still a fun time

There is enjoyment to be had but just don't expect this to be the best game in the series. Also on a side note. Although I compared this to ""Dark Knight Rises"" did anyone else pick up that Scarecrows plot is essentially the same exact one from ""Batman Begins""? Fear toxin all over Gotham etc

Anyway thank you for reading and please leave a upvote or comment explaining your feelings towards the game and this review!",4.0

"I was surprised and pleased with Mafia 2.  I went in without expectations (I picked it up for $10) and was satisfied in the end.  The story and voice acting are very well done and I liked the direction they went with it.  As opposed to many games that put you on the wrong side of the law, Mafia 2's story has a sense of realism to it.  Don't expect to do 10 missions and have more money than you could possibly spend in-game.  Money in Mafia 2 is earned the hard way, and every time you think you're getting somewhere in life (or the game, rather) things start to go awry.  I enjoyed the fighting (hand to hand and with firearms).  It's really satisfying when you canoe some dude's head in this one.  As a period piece, the game also does a good job, from the cars, to the radio programming, and even the liberal use of racial slurs.  A lot of time went into making the game ""feel"" authentic, and it shows.  Overall I would recommend fans of open world games a la GTA to give this one a try.",4.0
"I initially bought this game as a bday present to myself.  I played the base game and i liked it well enough to spring for the game of the year edition. Installation was easy enough and i had no issues with dlc itself. Aside from the occassional trademark fallout crash the base game and  the dlc went perfectly fine, mind u my computer isn't a sick rig since im on xp service pack 3. Having played all the dlcs, my favoriate one had to be poiny lookout hands down. The uniqueness of that dlc, compared to the others could not be matched, in my opinion. I gave this game 4 stars because, although the dlc ad ld more things to do, it is essentially the same thing round and shoot things. U spend alot of time running and or walking, ugh don't get me started on that stuff. Operation anchorage was beaten in less then an hour. Mothership zeta was also to short and very cliched and unimaginative. Poiny lookout was nice but wasn't expansive enough, and broken steel was a disapointment in so many ways. None of the dlc contents crashed for me. The price for this bundle was very resonable and it kept me entertained for a few days to a week tops, lol. I don't think ill be making the leap to new vagas, even though my pc can handle it, since i don't have the paitence to sit through yet again watch my character train for a runathon.",4.0
"When Oblivion first came out for the 360 i put 80 hours into, finished all of the guilds and most of the side quest, after over saturating myself i took 8 months-1 year break, and decided recently it was time to get back into it and I have beat Knights of Nine(which is also on this very same disc) and am half way through Shivering Isles.  And here we are...

Knights of Nine

-Good-

~Lengthy quest (5 hours), fun beginning, cool ending.  You get a new outfit with fairly nice benefits, nothing jaw dropping though.

~Kind of boss fight at the end in a cool environment(i don't want to spoil it)

-Bad-

~Half of the quest deals with you traveling all over the map to touch shrines(to become blessed), you have to find 8-9 of them.  You get a map, but the actual locations aren't marked on your main map so sometimes it takes longer then it should to find one.  Became some what tedious.

~More fetching type activites then actually meeting interesting characters, go in this cave to find this, go to this other cave to find that, etc...

~Everying thing besides the new boss where you fight the boss, and armor, you've seen before.

Shivering Isles

-Good-

~Very interesting story, great ideas and concepts.
~New environment, new weapons, new armor, new tougher enemies, great dialogue.
~Great main quest, and some entertaining side quests ( the first side quest i did; i was told by a distraught civilian that he hated his life and wanted me to kill him, but he didn't want to see it coming)
~You come across some interesting characters as mentioned above.
~Lengthy, i've put 15 hours into so far and am probably only half way done.
~Decent price, you get what you pay for, after all, $30 isn't cheap for an add-on.

-Bad-

~Review after review stats how different the two worlds are, mania(happy/energetic) and dementia(sad/angry), but honestly, they're not that different.  Don't get me wrong, you can tell which is which, but it's not nearly as extreme as i was made to believe.  Let's take leaves off trees and paint the vegetation in darker shades and call it dementia.  So far that's my only complaint.

For $30 this is a good deal because you actually get what you pay for.  An additional 30-40hours to an already extremly lengthy and well made game.  One side note, i bought this game downloaded it onto my 360, brought it my friends place and downloaded on his as well(he also had Oblivion).  Therefore, if you know someone else who wants it you guys should split the cost because you just download it on your hard drive and don't actually need the disc to play the game(you only need the Oblivion disc).",4.0
"Obviously the pricing isn't ideal. However, I would suggest if you haven't decided on a memory card size yet for your Vita then do yourself a favor and pick up the 32gb. There was a 4gb card with my Vita but I knew it was too small so I went and bought an 8gb. I had hoped that this size would last for awhile and save me the money from investing in the large size. It didn't.

Between the content in the Playstation store, movies, and music you'll probably end up storing on your Vita the 32gb is the only answer.",4.0
Please see my review of the Platinum edition of this game for my thoughts about the game itself. The one advantage to buying this copy of the Gold is that it comes with a printed manual. The hardcopy manual is far more convenient to use as you do not have to drop the game screen to open and read the electonic pdf file that comes with the Platinum one. Probably would be different if I had a 2 screen set up for my PC.,4.0

"I had been looking forward to this game ever since it was announced.  I loved the Stick of Truth.  That game got me interested in turn based combat games, a genre I never thought I would enjoy.  My hopes were very high, perhaps too high for the Fractured but Whole.

I'm sad to say that this game is not nearly as funny as the Stick of Truth.  There were some laugh out loud types of moments in the first game.  The humor in the Fractured but Whole fell flat though.  There was only one point where I laughed out loud.  The rest of the humor either completely missed the mark or occasionally made me chuckle to myself.  Even the character classes fell flat.  In the original, you could play as a Jew.  Since I am Jewish, I enjoyed playing as the Jew.  The classes in this game all felt very trite and it was like the creators didn't even try to be funny in coming up with the classes.  You develop a character sheet throughout the game, but those choices have no impact on how the game plays.

The one improvement over the original is the combat mechanics.  They are much improved over the original version.  It's still turn based, but you can move your character to different spots on a grid, as opposed to staying in one place.

There is nothing broken in this game. The combat works well and exploration is fun.  The game just isn't funny and the story isn't interesting.  I was shocked that after several years of development, this game fell so flat.  It's also relatively short.  I explored all of the nooks and crannies and completed all of the missions in about 25 hours.

Overall, this game feels mediocre.  It's only mildly entertaining.  I recommend picking up a copy once the price comes down, but to me, this game is not worth the new-release price.  If you haven't played the original, I highly recommend picking up a copy.",4.0
"I couldn't decide between Mad Max and Gear Solid V and I went with Metal Gear on launch.  I'm a casual gamer.  I'm not into stories or get in depth with characters and backstories.  I want to play a game not watch a movie.  Games should be games.  I'm a huge fan of the Hitman Series, Just Cause series, Crackdown series, etc.  I like games I get get in blow things up for a few hours and get on with life until my next couple of hours of gaming.

Saying that,  I never got into the Metal Gear series because I didn't want to sit through 9 hours of cut scenes.  THIS Metal Gear DOES NOT have the cutscenes like previous games and in fact, it stuffs the back stories, main elements of the story into analog tape files you can listen to at your own leisure.  This games is PACKED full of side missions and main missions, as well as, a mini-game fixing up your mother base.  It's a game though first.  In every way imaginable it's pure gaming heaven.  You can take on each mission or side mission one at a time.  Which means, I can spend two hours playing a mission and walk away feeling satisfied.  Considering I'm a casual gamer this game could literally take me a year to beat and play all the way through (side missions and everything).  Honestly, I don't even pay attention to whatever story is in the game, I don't really care but that's the beauty of it.  They built this game to be pure game first and story second.  That hooked me because gaming is what I want in some spurts.

I will say this, I ended up buying Mad Max.  I was reallllly hesitate to buy it based on all the bad reviews.  I was on twitch watching a guy play Mad Max and asked him, which game do you like better?  He said Mad Max hands down.  I couldn't figure out why.  So I bought it used at Gamestop (So I could take it back if I don't like it).  IN ALL HONESTLY, I LOVE MAD MAX better than Metal Gear Solid V.  I'm going to get alot of heat for this but I do.  Gamers that like Just Cause, Crackdown type games are going to LOVE Mad Max.  People that want to find loot, upgrade your character and car with special moves and abilities, if you like massive explosions and brutal fights and you only have a few hours to play every night or week, MAD MAX is to me....  addicting.  I'm having alot more fun play Mad Max then Metal at the moment.

I bought the Witcher 3 and played it for a week and was bored out of my mind.  I just couldn't do the story and riding the horse bugged the snot out of me.  I returned it and bought Batman.  I wanted to love Batman but returned it.  I bought Metal Gear and love it and will keep playing it, perfect couple hour spurt game BUT I ended up settling on Mad Max and love it.  It tickles all the right gamer buttons for me.",4.0
"While I enjoy this game it's just not the same as Spore. I understand they wanted to try and go with an Action RPG style for it, but that was what I loved most about the original Spore is that it didn't force you to follow a story or layer on complex controls. This game is pretty awesome and I intended to finish it, but it's not gonna be at the top of my backlog of games to finish.",4.0
"The Just Dance franchise continues to strike gold: this game follows along in the tradition now of good, fun family games, but this version does have some negatives. Note especially that this game is made up of downloadable content from Just Dance 2, so you don't necessarily have to go out and buy this as a whole set, simply select the songs you'd like online. However, if you want a hard copy backup of these tracks, this is a good idea. All in all, as I see it, this game can be broken down as follows:

PROS:

-FUN: There is no doubt that this game, like all others in the franchise, is fun. It's a great way to get members of your family dancing together, having fun, and exercising at the same time. Song selection, as always, has something for everyone, so every member of your family will enjoy some aspect of this game.

-COORDINATION: The coordination of the game with the Wii Remote is as with Just Dance 2. That is, this is a very good game in that the movements you make with your Wii remote are very accurately picked up by the Wii sensors.

-HARD COPY: The benefit in buying this as opposed to online, of course, is that you have a hard copy should your hard-drive crash.

CONS:

-EXPANSION PACK SIZE: As an expansion pack essentially (you don't need any other version to make this work, however), it only has a fraction of the games present in an original ""Just Dance"" game. The tracks are listed above however. They are fun, and this  game is priced reasonably enough considering the track size, so don't hesitate to buy it if you are looking to increase the number of tracks you possess.",4.0
"Socom 3 as you all know is the sequel to Socom II. They have improved the gameplay somewhat and the Single Player is funner in this game than Socom II. When you go online and register a name, they ask you for a credit card number to get a rank, stats, friends list, etc. What the heck! Oh Well. Another bad thing is that there is no maps from Socom II which was disappointing. All the maps in Socom 3 are from the Single Player Missions. A good thing is that there is better hit detection than Socom II and there is more weapons and attachments like scopes, front grips, M203's, etc. Also you can swim and dive underwater. Finally they have vehciles and tanks!  I'll break it down for you.

Graphics: 5/5 They have certainly improved the graphics in this game from Socom II. All the gun models are very nicely done along with the vehciles and tanks.

Sound: 5/5 The explosion and gernade effects are nice. Also the sound movement. When you are crawling through bushes, you can here the crunching noises and when you're in water as well.

Control: 4.5/5 They kind have mess with the controls somewhat, but good overall. There is some of control options you can adjust.

Fun: 4/5 Overall Socom 3 is fun, but it doesn't have the replay value as Socom II does. It gets a little repetitive sometimes and has some lag issues. And online, the stats never count and the ranking system is screwed up. Look at the message boards on Socom 3 and you'll see what I mean.",4.0

This is a linear FPS. The creativity comes in deciding how and with which weaponry you can defeat the enemy. I don't think you can just blast your way through. You actually have to plan your use of death-dealing machinery.",4.0

Having Street Fighter with over 30 characters for on the go is awesome. You cant ask for anything more... well you kind of could.

The only thing that stinks in this game, and its a big stinker, is the control. On a console controller or in the arcade i could bust out 50 fireballs in a row without a sweat. This game is a different story. The small size of the GBA/DS makes performing these special moves extremely tough. After 10 minutes of this game i feel like i need Bengay or some cream from the arthritis that this game is giving my fingers and hands. ;)

"After eight years without a new Metal Gear game, this franchise got it's third entry with Metal Gear Solid. The graphics have not aged well at all. Textures are very pixellated, animation is very jerky, and the framerate can get rather slow at times. The audio, however, has lots of great dialogue, combined with a catchy musical score.

The gameplay is based around stealth. You are Solid Snake, a spy working for a secret agency whose objective is to stop a device called Metal Gear, and save a couple of old guys. The story is deeper than that, of course, but in a nutshell, that's it. The controls, while laid out well, can be very unresponsive at times. The game itself is very fun (sneaking around to either get past or silently eliminate enemies), but is very easy to complete, and take away all of the cinematics and dialogue (12 hours of it all!), and you've got just three hours of gameplay.

Metal Gear Solid hasn't aged well at all, but is still very fun and happens to be a nice collector's piece for fans of the series. But should you start here? No, grab a GameCube and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (a next-gen remake of this) instead, then grab Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance on the PS2 or the Xbox.",4.0

"I purchased this game at the same time that I purchased Watch_Dogs. Played through Watch_Dogs first and then moved on to inFAMOUS. While the former left something to be desired, this game was quite the opposite. Sure, it's largely repetitive gameplay in terms of freeing city zones, climbing around to collect items, and progressing through a storyline that could have used some better fleshed-out characters (though the original two games weren't known for their stellar plots), but there's definitely a lot to do here.

If you're considering purchasing this game but are somewhat skeptical after the failure of other ""next-gen"" titles' abilities to live up to your expectations, please have no fear. This will be a stellar purchase compared to the other titles that came out for PS4 around launch.

"I was in the market for a mindless shooter that would deliver great visuals, great audio, and lots of shooting, and Quake 4 delivered on all accounts. It's not a perfect game, but it was perfect for what I was looking for at the time. Here is my take on it:

Good:

- Visuals. Even though this game is a year old, I was still impressed with the graphics. I love the opening planet invasion sequence. When you first land, you're ordered to enter the complex and rendevous with the team. But before just charging in, I stopped for a minute and looked up and saw alien fighters swooping in and out, large explosions, planetary guns firing off into space, and more. It was a real visual treat.

- Audio: The audio is fantastic. Bombs going off in the distance, aerial bombardments, gunfire from far off enemies. It's a cacophony of war sounds. The audio really helps keep the adrenaline flowing.

- Performance: I'm not experiencing any of the slowdowns people are reporting. I've turned on all the features including 2XAA. My system is a year old as well: AMD Athlon 64 X2 3800+, 1 GB RAM, eVGA 6800GS.

- Atmosphere: It's not quite as dark as some people have been saying. Yes, there are certain sections that are dark, but that's pretty realistic considering the power has been knocked out in certain areas of the complex. Also, there are several levels that take place outside, which is a nice change of pace.

- Squad AI: These guys actually know how to fight! They take cover and cover each other. And although, this might seem a little amateurish, they will often point the way. If you're in a dark corridor and don't know where to go, look at your squad mates and see which direction they're pointing. This will help about half the time. There are lots of sections where they rely on you to find the way.

- Enemy AI: I think the enemy AI is better than almost every game out there that I've played with the exception of FEAR. If you're new to really good AI, you'll be fairly impressed. They take cover and try to outflank you. The only thing they don't seem to do that the AI in FEAR does is they don't actually try to create cover by knocking things over.

- Weapons: They start out pretty standard: pistol, machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, but you start to get cool new weapons like the nail gun and lighting gun. I'm also putting this in the Pros section because they sound awesome.

- Vehicles: The troop transport is really cool and fun. See below for more on the bad ones.

Bad:

- Cut scenes: Some seem a little unnecessary and could have been accomplished through in-game dialogue. But again, with a lot of the ""bad"" things I list here, there is an upside. Quake 4 is such a non-stop adrenaline rush, these cut scenes provide an opportunity to catch your breath.

- Vehicles: These are really a mixed bag. There is one where you actually only sit in it for 30 seconds and take one shot, which is kind of weird. And I didn't enjoy the tank. It slid around too much. But I did enjoy riding on the back of the troop transport manning the machine gun. That was loads of fun just mowing down Strogg. So this one isn't all bad.

"I enjoy anime. I adore 2D fighting games. And Ive read through some fantastic visual novels during my lifetime of comedic peasantry, yet somehow, I didn't know what I was jump-kicking into when my Editor-in-chief requested a reviewer for Nitroplus Blasterz. Eyeballing the title, I figured Id be scaling the treacherous cliffs of K2s Magic Line with a canister of nitro on my back, blasting away ice sheets so as to expose and recover my lost lovers frozen corpse, and dragging it down to base camp before the ghost of Bill Paxton stabs my bundled heroine with an empty syringe. But instead of a supernatural gaming sequel to the tragic family rescue film Vertical Limit (Vertical Limit II: Mountains Infinite Explosion!!!), I discovered, with a search engine powered by inquisitiveness, an attractive fighting game with a roster of sweet yet aggressive ladies, who originate from a variety of Nitroplus properties and visual novels.

Thankfully, as to be expected from most titles published by the mighty XSeed, Nitroplus is a little more intricate than the bopping beauties and crossover ties might initially have you believe: With precise controls, characters with distinct personalities evinced through their move-sets, and battle mechanics that are easy to grasp while having the potential for frenetic complexity, Nitroplus is a game that rivals most contemporary brawlers when it comes to pure enjoyment. In fact, its so damn fun that you might be able to overlook or cope with the lack of game modes (there isn't even a tutorial), lifeless stages and presentation, and the upbeat but often unremarkable music.

As someone who isn't impressively familiar with Nitroplus, I had no idea who the hell the majority of the 14 playable characters (two of whom are free DLC for the first month of release) were or where the hell they hailed from. But after experimenting with each ones thigh-bruising move-set, I was absolutely compelled to scoop my jaw from the carpet and research their origins; these ladies, warning all not to take their cute, innocent appearances as feminine fragility, rock the arena with hyperbolically impactful PG-13 brutality. This is thanks to a fighting system that provides speed, input accuracy, a variety of Super Move mechanics that dramatically extend the length and dazzle of base combos, and offensive/defensive options that offer fairness and flexibility for most play styles.

Mind you, theres nothing new or mega-extraordinary about said fighting system, but that doesnt take away from its solid construction, surprising intuitiveness, or, once you familiarize yourself with multiple characters, the unique feel of each ladys fighting identity. Basic combos, which are executed by compiling a succession of weak, medium, and strong attacks, are reinforced by special attacks of the half-circle and charging variety to accumulate bars on your Power Gauge, which allows you to perform one of two Super Moves: Variable Rush (consumes 2 units of the power bar), a graceful flurry of fists and feet that acts as a sort of savage auto-combo; and the Lethal Blaze (consumes 3 units), a characters signature, stylish, and career-ending eruption of ultimate power, which not only prompts a short cut-in animation of the offensive character posing before performing, but also has the potential to rob an opponent of over half her precious life gauge.

Each character can also summon the assistance of two partners (of which there are 20 to choose from) with a tap of the left triggers, once the respective gauge of each partner is automatically filled throughout the round. Part of the intensity of learning the fighting system is experimenting with each partner's distinctive move. Most of them have outlandish attacks, like calling upon a lumbering horde of undead to trample your foe into a daze, but others have support moves, such as strengthening your defense or slowly replenishing your Power Gauge. Whatever the support characters function, mixing their moves into the fray generates an environment of strategic mayhem, in which a fantastic blur of lasers, katana, and laced thighs gracefully overpopulate the screen.

Actually, all this on-screen pandemonium is so mesmerizing, you might overlook the barren stages, with backgrounds so devoid of motion and enthusiasm that if you stared at them in isolation, youd start feeling inadequate both financially and sexually. Heck, the combat is so fun, it might convince you that the music is actually memorable, which it isnt, and partially responsible for your unstoppable winning streak. You might be so hypnotized by Super Sonicos shapely charisma and feline rush that youll say Who needs more game modes or a decent story or a competent in-game tutorial? Just give me more Sonico, all-up-in-my-face! Thats the possible effect NPBs fun factor can have; you're aware the games many inefficiencies, yet you're too pleased by the combat to give a damn.

Yes, NPB is missing a lot of polished characteristics weve come to expect in 2D fighting games (that is, anything developed by Arc System Works); however, if you are a devotee of anime, manga, Japanese culture, or interactive competitive fun, and also appreciate the artistic muscle of simple but undeniably solid fighting mechanics, Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel is a pleasing acquisition. It definitely won't dethrone your current favorite fighting game, but it will be a worthy supplement to your flashy fighting collection.

"Fighter graphics have improved, yet can't say the same thing about stages and background.  They look and feel dull.

Vader certainly makes his presence felt.  Nice addition to the line up.

I don't care for single player modes, I just use them to make gold to unlock stuff.  Didn't enjoy it in other games, not enjoying it here.  If I wanted to watch CGI, I would have bought MGS4.

Multiplayer is another story.  With these graphics and fighters the game has no equal.  Especially if you master Vader.  I usually play offline with my friends.  They love it, I love it, end of story.

If you liked it before, you will like it again.  You can always try it before you buy it.  Recommended, highly.",4.0
"Last year's Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 launched with the Xbox 360 in a good fashion, standing among the best of the launch's numerous sports titles. Last year I concluded my review of Tiger 06 saying, ""I hope next year's version of Tiger is fleshed out and features more while continuing to improve on the great gameplay."" Well, Tiger 07 is just that game I hoped for. It's a fleshed-out and well-done edition of a fine sports franchise, and now stands near the top of the Xbox 360's stack of sports titles.

Tiger 06 initially whipped me. It beat me into shape and forced me to learn the subtle things about golf, the things that make the ball roll just a little closer or land at a better spot on the course. It, however, could eventually become the easiest video game around. Tiger 07 looks to change this, forcing even more realistic difficulty into the gameplay. The core mechanics remain mostly unchanged-you still swing dynamically with the left analog stick, pulling back to backswing and pushing forward to foreswing. However, this year's game has a little twist; rather than Tiger 06's arrow that showed you where exactly your ball should land, Tiger 07 features a wide aiming area on each shot. This circular area represents where your ball can possibly land. Unless the golfer makes perfect contact and accurately judges the lie, the wind, and the spin on the ball, it is entirely possible for the ball to end up yards away from where it was intended to land.

Fortunately it's as simple as ever to take a shot and after practice it's quite easy to learn all of Tiger's tricks. Things like the wind and the lie only require a little time to get a feel for. I noticed that hitting the ball off of the side of a hill now has a very dramatic effect on where it will go in the air, and it feels almost like backspin and topspin on the ball no longer send the ball flying in the intended direction when it lands. Though the game is noticeably tougher and definitely punishing, Tiger 07 is difficult to put down.

You'll start Tiger 07 by creating your golfer with the deep Game Face system. My golfer looked so much like me that it was almost scary to look at him on the course. Following that, the game offers a long and engaging career mode; one that sends you week after week playing through tournaments at familiar courses like Riviera, Pinehurst, and Pebble Beach as well as Bandon Dunes, Carnoustie, Firestone Country Club, and more. The amount of courses I just rambled off is equal to last year's puny list of six, and Tiger 07 features even more. Similar to real life, getting better in your career can only be done by playing more. At first, this is difficult; your golfer's initially a total chump on the course. By performing golfing drills, competing in golfing games, and most simply, playing, your golfer's stats will raise and your on-the-course performance will improve. All of the stat changes are dynamic. By hitting a lot of lucky shots, your Luck stat will increase. Getting close on approach shots will improve your overall Approach stat, and using the game's Power Boost ability (jam a button to increase the power of a shot in mid-swing), you'll benefit from a bigger Power Boost stat. Tiger 07 doesn't give you a lot of freebies; to get better at the game you just have to play more. After a while you'll be blasting the ball down the fairway and having no trouble with that aiming area.

Tiger 06 looked great on the Xbox 360, and somehow Tiger 07's added even more detail to the beautiful courses. EA's Universal Capture technology looks great on Tiger Woods but all of the other characters animate well and swing animations look great. The fans that crowd the course are a little too numerous but it's interesting and cool to see them walk towards your ball and follow you around the course. The commentary, done by the same two fellows from Tiger 06, isn't much different. It's very appropriate to golf, and it's fun to hear them mock each other from time to time. I especially like when one of them calls my shot incorrectly and the other says, ""What are you talking about? That was a great shot "" Every virtual golfer needs a confidence boost from time to time.

Tiger 07 plays better than any Tiger before it, it looks beautiful, it sounds great, it comes chock-full of modes...the list goes on and on; EA Redwood did a fantastic job. As a result, the second next-gen golf title is a winner. Though it's a little tough at first, Tiger 07 has few flaws and it's one of the better next-gen sports titles. Virtual golfers should definitely check it out.",4.0
"I received Time as part of simultaneous release of other Disney Infinity 3.0 characters from the movie- Alice through the looking glass. Other Disney Infinity figures I purchased were Alice and Mad Hatter.

This is my least favorite character of the three. Maybe because I haven't seem the movie to get to know or relate to him, or maybe its the Black on Black clothing that looked a bit bland... But maybe that's the idea, dark and sinister. At least the facial expression looks expressive enough with that disdain (you're not worthy) look. Or maybe he knows that Disney Infinity is about to run it's course... ""Oh Well' he said. Boo~ :(

"I already reviewed the Nintendo 3DS version of this game, but since this game has just been available for rental via redbox, I thought I'd give the game a shot on the Playstation 4. Nevertheless, if you want to see my 3DS review, you can look here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R292PWUACJWTCF/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm

Anyway, this game is one of the latest to be published by Activision, who you may know as the game company that's been releasing garbage after garbage people are expected to pay money for. Despite their truly awful lineup of ""games"" this year alone, Snoopy's Grand Adventure avoids the loads of pitfalls that most of Activision's 2010-era games usually fall into, probably because it seems that development team Behaviour Interactive has actually gotten to figure out how to use Unity by this time. Even though they made the disastrous Spongebob HeroPants game earlier this year, their take on Snoopy is actually not bad.

In every sense of the word, this game is a platformer. Snoopy hops and bops his way through the various levels of six themed worlds whilst avoiding obstacles and enemies (unless you rather want to jump on them), and every world ends with a boss level that either is a battle or race against it. Snoopy fills out the platform game checklist to the brim, but even though it won't win originality awards anytime soon, that doesn't mean the game can't be fun or presented well otherwise.

The graphics are simply BEAUTIFUL! I already was satisfied with the scenic and colorful environments on the Nintendo 3DS version, but everything here is completely lush and vibrant, flowing with detail, and yet still manages to complement the the CGI Peanuts Movie art style as well as the game's soundtrack suits Peanuts as a whole with its collection of jazz-like melodies sprinkled throughout the journey. Not to mention, loading times are quick, and the game runs entirely in silky-smooth 60fps (although I did see a bit of a framerate drop in one level)! The whole thing feels generally polished, which is something I never thought I'd say about a game published by Activision.

Snoopy himself is agile enough to make the platforming enjoyable. His running and jumping controls like you'd expect, but he can also helicopter his ears like Rayman and put on plenty of costumes that would each grant Snoopy a unique power as well as a reference for die-hard Peanuts fans out there. Some powers include floatier jumps, the ability to find passages hidden in certain walls, freezing enemies by facing them, etc.

As for the level designs, they really don't put up too much of a challenge, as platforming fans can breeze through the game without worry. Nevertheless, the environments are varied and provide a good amount of ways for the player to advance thanks to the multiple paths and areas. Jellybeans are scattered around like coins, and they are just as satisfying to collect, but there are also Beagle Scouts you can find in certain places. They probably don't do anything more than provide achievements, but they at least provide some replay value.

That isn't quite enough to justify the big issue, though. Before you think about buying the game, you should ask yourself: ""Should I pay fifty bucks for a game that lasts two to three hours?"" While the game has plenty of pleasant qualities going for it, the length is pretty darn short for the price point. I personally don't care (Plus, I rented this, anyway), but there are definitely people out there that don't consider a few hours to be worth that amount of money. I recommend either renting the game or buying it when it inevitably dips in price by at least thirty dollars.",4.0
"I really enjoyed this game, despite the negative review scores form the video games media (currently, a 54/100 on metacritic).

Graphics - the quality of the graphics in this game are more subtle than what you might expect from a next-gen title; they're nothing eye popping at first glance, but as you play the game, you notice the small details that really stand out from a regular PS3 game.  The first thing I noticed, was the little blocks that Knack is made of, have really detailed textures.  Also, the shininess of the metal and other jewels in the game look so realistic.  The rest of the game looks pretty much like a Dreamworks or Pixar animated movie.  If you like this type of art style, you're going to enjoy the graphics of this game.

Sound - For the most part, the sound is pretty good.  It doesn't use a ton of surround sound like other games, particularly first person shooters or 3rd person shooters. But this is a 3D platformer, so you really don't have a lot of enemies off to your left or right, or behind you to really take advantage of surround.  You do have the soundtrack, which isn't anything spectacular, utilizing the surround, but that's about it.  The game does utilize the speaker on the DualShock 4 when Knack picks up the small blocks to get bigger.  On the whole, I'd say the sound is just so-so, not good, but not bad.

Multi-player - I believe the game has some sort of co-op, but I did not use it, and I do not know for sure.  However, it does have an asynchronous multi-player component, when you find treasure boxes, you can swap what you found with treasures that people on your friends list found--sometimes, they found better, more rare treasures than you, and you can take what they got instead of what you got.  Also, there is a companion smartphone app for both iOS and Android.  The app is nothing special, and kind of mimics Bejeweled; however, it's not as fun as Bejeweled, and quickly becomes boring.  I really wish it did a better job of imitating Bejeweled, giving you the power-ups that you get form matching sets of 4 or 5.  You basically match sets of 3, 4, or 5 + combos to fill up your crystal gauge.  Once the gauge is filled, if you run into trouble, you can swipe down on all 3 crystals and tap any block in the field to remove all those type of block on the screen.  As you play, you fill up an experience gauge to increase your level; when you gain a new experience level, you are awarded with a secret treasure, that is synced up with your PS4 version of Knack.  This helps you immensely, because there are maybe 3 or 4 chests on each level of Knack, and this app helps you complete the components to gain all of his extra powers.

Story - Overall the story is good.  It's nothing too deep or serious, and you don't really get the whole story about the Goblins, and why they're at war with the humans.  But on a whole, the story is light and fun.

Gameplay/Fun - The game play mechanics are pretty much the same controls as God of War.  Hit 1 button to attack, one button to jump, one button for a special attack, left analog stick to move, and right analog stick to roll or dodge.  Overall the controls are pretty good, I don't know for sure, but I don't seem to remember having a block button that was as effective as in God of War (L1 trigger), so if you're not good at dodging, you're going to get hit and die a lot.  If you die, not to worry, you generally start back at the last checkpoint with full health.  Many times, I'd get to the next checkpoint with very low health, and get killed, only to respawn at the last checkpoint with a full health bar.  There are some pretty challenging arena type battles with tanks and such, that can require a lot of skill, but as a God of War fan, I didn't have too much trouble.  If you're not good at these types of games, or are getting this game for children, I'd suggest using the easy difficulty setting.

Another slightly annoying thing about the game was that I'd get through a certain chapter or section, and by the end of that section, Knack was so powerful and enormous.  It was a lot of fun to be able to kill large goblins, tanks and robots with one or two hits.  However, almost without fail, at the end of the chapter, knack would drop all of his power-ups and you'd begin the next chapter as baby knack.  I understand what the game designer was trying to do, but I would have liked to just make the enemies maybe slightly harder instead of starting all over again w/Knacks health gauge and power-ups.  You can play the game over again after beating it to use the gems you found throughout your  first play-through, and from the mobile app, but I didn't feel too compelled to play the game again.  You have no control over the items you get from playing the mobile app, so some of the more rare treasures are tough to get, so I wasn't able to play as ""Diamond"" Knack or anything.

Overall, I give the game about a 4/5, because it was a lot of fun.  I personally didn't really feel the need to play through it again, but this is mainly because I have many other games in my backlog, and I just couldn't justify spending more time on it.  However if you don't own a lot of games, or are all caught up, the game does have some replay value.  The experience is pretty linear, and the enemies all appear in the same place every time, so don't expect to discover much more after your first play-through (not that it's a bad thing, just FYI).  So to summarize, it's a very fun 3D platformer, so if that's your type of game, you'll enjoy it--I definitely recommend this game.",4.0
"Pretty decent amount of resistance.  Will not really protect from major impact, but is sturdy enough in case of drops or rubbing against other objects.

Has enough room for three UMDs... barely.  I usually just keep the PSP in the case when I am not using it at home to prevent dust from getting into the seams or in case I knok something onto it or knock it off the shelf accidentally. Doesn't make much sense for a travel case unless you only take along a couple of UMDs and don't mind having the headphones in a pocket or such.

If you are like me though, this is a great case to pop the PSP into then place in your backpack.  Since I ride a lot on my bike, it makes sense.  Plus I always carry headphones for my phone anyway... so it works for me.

Also of note: There is the small wrist strap included, but it doesn't really fit well onto the PSP strap clasp.  I use the aftermarket Nintendo Wii remote wrist straps instead for the PSP itself.  They are more comfortable anyway.  But for $4.99 it's worth it.

And the third party I bought it from offered the case with Prime shipping and it arrived in the two days and in perfect condition.  Happy with them, and I've bought from them before. (OEM Planet)",4.0

"I purchased the Limited Edition version of Halo 3 that comes with a bonus disc of video, metal case with slip cover and small hard cover book with additional information on the game and its elements.

I would like to clarify that I did not have the original Xbox or get into Halo: Combat Evolved or Halo 2.  I purchased an Xbox 360 as I believe to be the best choice for me for a gaming console, and I jumped right into the excitement over Halo 3.  I rented Halos 1 and 2 to see if I would like them.  I enjoyed both games, despite not finishing them completely prior to Halo 3's release.  I even purchased both of those games.  I completed about 75% of the first game and about 20% of the second.  I just couldn't wait to solve both of them before playing the ""next-gen"" version.  That being said, I am not as familiar with the Halo story or universe.  I don't think this made too much of a difference in getting into Halo 3.  I think one could get Halo 3 having never played the other games...granted you would wonder a little about the back story, but the game play would suck you in and forget about that until you finished the game.  Now I am going back to play the first two games to completion.  I know it's a little late, but now I am into the Halo thing...

I have played the game completely through on Normal.  I did not think it was too short.  I thought that I had solved the game twice, when in fact there were more levels and more story.  I felt satisfied with the campaign aspect of the game (even compared to BioShock, Lost Planet, Prey and Gears of War).  Now, I am going back through the game to collect the skulls for extra features and achievement points.  The campaign was a little challenge for me on the normal difficulty...it wasn't too easy and not too hard.  I was stuck in about 3 places that took a day to move on through by myself versus co-op play.  Now if I try to play on Heroic or Legendary difficulty, I will have to call in a friend for support via co-op such as I did with Gears of War on Insane.

Graphically, this game is impressive.  While the screen layout and the weapons are similar to the previous versions and seem very familiar, they are better graphically.  The designers didn't completely overhaul the Halo gaming experience...just gave it a renovation similar to what one might see on a TV show about flipping a house...excuse the analogy, but I think it is a good way to describe the difference.  The Halo universe is prettier and even more colorful with sharper lines and details.  This game has wonderful scenery like the jungles in the beginning to the futuristic interior of bases and spaceships, or later in the game from the desert with sand dunes to snow covered mountains.

The online play is where this game really shines.  The online matchmaking system is wonderful.  You aren't thrown into a game with a group of die hard Halo fans where you get completely slaughtered...you are matched by your abilities in the game with players of similar attributes for a fun and even handed match.  There are a number of game modes where you can play death match type free for alls or team based games such as capturing the enemy's territory.  With the Forge aspect of the game the online play is editable and customizable to give this game a great deal of replay value for the online players out there.

I gave this Limited Edition 5 stars for fun, and I do believe it lives up to the hype.  This is a solid game that one can play over and over and enjoy it as much if not more as time goes on.  However, I gave it 4 stars for the game overall as the extra stuff that comes with this version is not high quality or quantity.  The bonus disc really only features one making of documentary if you play all of the segments as one movie.  It is fun to see all the time and effort that went into making this game, but after watching it I thought that's it?  There should be some added features like maybe including some features from making the older two games, or some more footage as to where they are thinking they will go in the future with other games or characters.  I was also hoping for some exclusive content like gamer pics, themes, etc.  The metal case is very nice, but as with many others who have reported...my second bonus disc was scratched!  The disc comes loose inside the case very easily.  The plastic center holder does not fit snug enough on the disc to anchor it in a way that eliminates damage during shipment.  Be careful when buying it...gently shake the box before checking out to see if there are loose discs.  Make sure you grab one that does not sound like a box of Legos!  I didn't have an option as I preordered mine.  The disc was loose and it was scratched, but it played just fine.

Buy with confidence...this is a good solid first person shooter game that lives up to the hype of the ""next-gen"" console war.  I would add that if you don't always watch the extra making of features or documentaries, you may want to just buy the regular version with the game disc only.  If you are a huge Halo fan, then you probably already have the Legendary Edition with the helmet...or if you are still debating on which one to buy get the one with the helmet and all the goodies...they are in a better box that anchors the discs better...plus Master Chief's helmet sitting in your game room just looks impressive!",4.0

Then after several good deeds you make a mistake and burn down the sacred elf forest by bringing a bunch of fireball slinging minions without thinking one of them may catch everything on fire.

Additionally, there are bonuses that can be applied to space battles or ground battles.

As for the negatives about this game, I would say that after a while it gets old.  You get to play different sides but you're mostly fighting over the same planets, with the exception of a few.

"When I first heard about this game, I was rather excited because there weren't many RPGs available on the PS3 at the time.  I've only just now gotten around to playing this game (spent all my money on DS games!).  When I first heard the game's premise (that you are experiencing the fever dream of famed composer Frederic Chopin), I was really intrigued.  It's a very unique  premise for an RPG and has the potential to be deep, artistically meaningful experience.  After a string of crummy games I'd played prior, it was with some trepidation that I fired up my PS3 and placed the Eternal Sonata disc in the slot...

Graphics (score 9/10): It doesn't really matter how many pixels the game engine will display or how fancy the lighting system is if the art design is boring and uninspired.  Eternal Sonata really proves this point with copious amounts of creative art design.  Everything is vibrant and eye-catching with a myriad blend of bright colors.  There is also fantastic detail in the environment designs (especially the towns), and I haven't seen environments this beautiful since Final Fantasy IX (remember what the town of Cleyra looked like?).  As for the character designs, they all have very distictive appearances and nicely detailed outfits, but characters' faces are not as detailed as they could be.  Also, the character acting in the cutscenes is kind of lacking - they frequently make really awkward gestures and motions (such as when characters are supposed to be touching something, but there's like a foot of space between their hands and the thing).  Really, though, they aren't that bad and I can hardly hold it against this game when everything else is so beautiful.

Music (score 10/10):  Some of Frederic Chopin's actual music is played during certain scenes, but most of the music was created specifically for the game.  Either way, all the music is lovely.  I felt that each new piece of background music fit well with either the location or the event and that all of them are very pleasant to listen to.  Plus, many of the tracks are quite long and detailed so the ""20-second-repeating-loop"" problem isn't an issue here!  Now, the other half of the aural experience is voice acting.  This is not quite as awesome as the music.  It's certainly not the worst voice acting I've ever heard (that distinguished accomplishment belongs to the first Grandia), but it's not the best either.  The problem really is that there are several younger characters that have voices that either sound fake (like when an adult is obviously pretending to be a child) or are slightly annoying sounding (Salsa's voice irritates me slightly).  Overall, though, the voices are not bad, and the actors themselves do a pretty good job, so I'm not going to hold it against them.  Plus, Frederic's voice is pure awesomeness.

Characters (score 9/10):  Oddly, Frederic's in-game character model does bear some resemblance to the real-world Chopin; you know, if he were a beautiful anime character who looked not at all like the age he was supposed to be.  The other characters are 100% fictional.  Frederic spends his time interacting with these characters in his ""dream world"".  Well, Frederic himself is awesome; just the sort of refined, elegant personality that I imagined he may have really had (okay, so I have no idea what the real Chopin's personality was like).  Realistic or not, he IS cool.  Now, there are a handful of other characters (Allegretto, Polka, Beat, Viola, Crescendo, etc. - note that they are all named after musical terms) who also have good characterizations and well-developed personalities.  The only one who really annoyed me was Salsa.  She's just got one of those bratty personalities that make you want to slap her upside her head.  Despite Salsa, by the end of the game, I was really attached to these characters.

Story (score 8/10):  The basic premise of this game is that you are experiencing a rather detailed fever dream that is being experienced by famous composer Frederic Chopin.  First, let me get a little confession out of the way...  Sadly, I'm woefully ignorant about Chopin's life (which I remedied somewhat by reading some Wikipedia) and about classical music in general (I really don't understand what a ritardando is, even when I do read the definition).  This game is chock full of music-related references (there's even a character named Allegretto!).  I imagine these would mean more to me if I had some kind of background in music at all...  Oh well.  Anyway, the premise itself is a really interesting basis for an RPG.  Most RPGs have your standard  ""kid from small village saves the world from random evil guy plot"" but Eternal Sonata breaks out of this mold.  In fact, the premise is just refreshingly different among a sea of generic RPG stories.  I think this is the game that really proves that RPG storylines can be truly innovative and different.  Okay, so the premise is good, but is the rest of the actual story executed well?  Well, yes.  I found it gripping all the way throughout.  Even though the ending is kind of confusing at first, it's just the sort of ending that forces one to think, and the story is at least interesting all the way through.

Battle System (score 7/10): The combat system is sort of a weird hybrid between turn-based and active.  Basically, each character/enemy has turns, but each turn is on a timer and you move freely about the field during your turn.  Actions are performed by pressing certain buttons which are visible in an onscreen menu.  At the beginning of the game, if you stop moving, your time gauge stops.  However, as the game goes on, they constantly change the battle system so that it doesn't stop anymore and it gives you less and less time (until it eventually stops altogether) to plan your attack at the very beginning of battle (at early stages the time gauges don't start until you move).  This irked me quite a bit because just as you are getting use to how battle works, they change it!  Plus, I just prefer turn-based in general and would've liked it kept that way.  Perhaps they should've just made turn-based or active an option that could be turned on or off from the Options menu.  That would've been best.  Related to this problem is using items.  By the end of the game, you'll be able to carry around up to 40 items (depending on the type of item) and the game does not stop the active time gauge to let you scroll through items.  This got frustrating, believe me.  There are other issues with battle too.  there is a guard system that is notoriously difficult to get to work correctly.  I don't know why, but I had terrible difficulty making it work even though I hit that guard button as soon as the icon came up.  In normal games, blocking attacks is a bonus that helps you avoid damage.  If you miss, the enemy does a normal amount of damage.  In this game, though, failing to guard hurts you quite a lot.  The game is still manageable if you level properly, though, and the rest of the battle system is technically decent.  There is one other thing about the battle system that is kind of cool - the light/dark system.  Basically, shadows and light on the battlefield effect enemies strengths, and characters abilities to use certain skills.  In other words, some enemies morph into stronger beasts in the light/dark, and you can only use certain skills when standing in light/dark areas.  This was a pretty innovative feature.

Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The first thing I want to mention here may seem random, but it's something that's been irking me for a long time.  PS3 game developers seem to think that because you are probably using an HDTV, it's okay to shrink on-screen text to a size where no one can see it.  Thankfully, Eternal Sonata doesn't do this.  So, I salute you for your nice text size, Eternal Sonata, by pointing it out in this review!  I do have other complaints though...  First off, this game can be mean about the the lack of places to heal.  Places to heal (some people let you rest in their house) are few and far between.  Even worse, sometimes I was stuck before a boss with no way to level raise.  Literally, it wouldn't let me go anywhere except to the boss.  That means that if you happened to accidentally be too low-leveled, you're absolutely screwed.  That's just crummy game design, but it's part of a larger problem.  The game won't let you backtrack much at all, and thus it feels much too restrictive.  I don't mind linearity in the sense that your movements are strongly influenced by the narrative, but this is just ridiculous.  I actually took to keeping three different save files at a time just in case I got stuck somewhere.  Utterly frustrating.  Plus, there is never any point in the game where you have the option to move around the world wherever you want (and no sidequests at the end outside of an optional dungeon).  I've heard that if you replay using the new game+ feature, you can use the warp pad in Baroque city to go to other places, but this doesn't happen on the first playthrough.  Either way, the game feels too cripplingly locked down.  This game's also mean about arbitrarily removing people from your party at certain points, and then not unequipping their accessories so that you literally have no access to them until the next time that character rejoins.  The game is also very arbitrary and unpredictable sometimes about who will be available for a boss fight.  There were several times where the story would shove an unwanted character into a boss fight with no prior foreshadowing or warning.  Other than those issues (which are admittedly pretty big issues), there isn't much else to complain about.

Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I've played a ton of video games, some good, some terrible, some that were just okay, but it's been a long time since I've played a video game that was  so hard to judge.  On the one hand, the graphics, story, characters, and music are a clear artistic experience, but the gameplay is not up to par.  I desperately wanted to give this game a perfect score because the premise is so fascinating, but the somewhat painful gameplay holds it back from perfection.  It's not perfect, but it's still a very good game.  I've become very fond of Frederic and crew despite some of this game's shortcomings, so I suppose it's a success in that regard.  In the end, I think my final score is a fair one given my experience with this game.  If you are curious about this game, or are an RPG enthusiast like I am, then you'll want to get a copy of Eternal Sonata; despite it's flaws, it's still worth adding to your collection.",4.0

"This game probably deserves 3 stars but with the sheer amount of work Bioware put into this game in terms of lore and dialogue I have to give them 4 stars but it will never be a 5 star game due to one thing: collecting.

I don't mind collecting things too much but in this game...thats pretty much all you do. I've never played a game with this amount of collecting, gathering and useless sidequests. It is almost absurd how redundant and repetitive these are by the time you finish the game.

Here's how the game is played

The game (world) is played on roughly 10 maps. Each map is an overland area like a mini Skyrim or Dragons Dogma ""open world"", each of them contains ""lists"" of things to do, like collecting something or finding X number of things on the map and marking them. Here's a sample of what you do on each map:

- A primary quest to complete.
- A dragon to kill.
- Collecting shards!!!! (gives you a bonus to a character stat..not worth the effort)
- Find each landmark (gives you certain game points called power and influence)
- Find each campsite (like a bonfire or checkpoint or safe zone)
- Finding all the Ocularums and Astrariums (gives you certain game points as above or a secret cave stash with loot or reveals shard locations)
- Miscellaneous minor side quests involving finding, collecting or killing something.
- Collect various miscellaneous objects like mosaics and bottles of wine or beer.

While you are doing the 10 maps you can also choose to do the main storyline quest which will take you to the midpoint of the game where you own your own castle called Skyhold. You can deck it out somewhat and it reminds me a little of Suikoden but sadly its not exactly as involved as that since there aren't many characters in Skyhold that do anything useful IMO. There is also a war table (world map) where you have your agents do things like auto collecting material for you or unlock additional maps (out of the 10). These things require power which you gain while playing the game. By the time you finish the game your war table or world map will be completely filled in.

The second half of the game is more of the same until you beat it. Unfortunately your character isn't as memorable as say past Dragon Age games IMO and certain older characters seem to be shoe horned in where it could have easily been anyone else, having some of these older characters show up simply answers the old FAQ: ""Where are they now?"". Their parts just seem brief and generic even though they are placed in critical situations in various parts of the main story.

As negative as this review sounds the game is still Dragon Age with lots of stories to tell, maps to explore and a few dungeons (I was hoping for more) to conquer. Also there are quite a bit of dragons to kill that are pretty difficult to take down if you are under powered and the crafting system is rather well done. If you spend time with crafting you can make yourself much better weapons and armor than what you will find. Character skills and skill trees are OK, some of them were really cool and others seemed pretty useless but overall it gives you a wealth of options to customize a character to suit your style. The game is also filled with dialogue, cut scenes, stories, romances, books and other things to do with your companions that they grow on you and by the end of the game I'm happy to say Bioware successfully made a game that makes up for the travesty IMO that was Dragon Age II.

I beat this game and its DLC, completed every quest and collected almost every item and I can firmly give this 4 stars. If your a Dragon Age fan do yourself a favor and buy the game and keep in mind two things: Do not bother with collecting everything cause you will go insane and get to Skyhold (do the main quests early on), with that in mind you will probably have a much better time than I did.

Now lets hope we see a sequel but with much less shard collecting!!",4.0
"I never played any of the LEGO games before this, but always thought they looked like fun. They already have LEGO Star Wars, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, and Pirates of the Caribbean, so I wondered when they were going to make LEGO Lord of the Rings. Being a HUGE LOTR fan, I had to get this.

For the first 2 or 3 hours, I was a little disappointed. I think my expectations were too high due to all the hype. Some previews were saying things like ""this isn't just the best LEGO game, it may be the best LOTR game"" and how it was going to be open world. One person called it ""Skyrim for kids"". It's not the best LOTR game...it's too condensed and too simple, and it really isn't what I consider ""open world"". Yes you can explore off the path and you can revisit locations as you wish, but you can't go too far and you can't for example take a different route to get to Mordor than they took in the book/movies. Some areas are fairly big while others are really small. Rivendell is pretty big, while Bree is like 4 or 5 houses, then when you leave you literally turn a corner, go over a hill, and there's Weathertop.

Once I got about 5 hours in though, I cast aside my preconceived expectations and began just having a blast. The cutscenes are HILARIOUS. I've laughed out loud so many times. It's a really fun game, and addicting. I like how you actually get to play as Isildur and fight Sauron at the beginning, and fight Saruman and the balrog as Gandalf, and get to play as FREAKING TREEBEARD and just step on orcs, and as Faramir and try to take down the oliphaunts! It covers the entire story and lets you play most of the memorable scenes. The fighting is a bit on the easy side (it's kind of like Fable 2 & 3 where you can't really ""die"", you just lose some money every time, which could have been used for buying new and better equipment), but there are puzzles that have had me stumped. It doesn't hold your hand and show you what to do.

As of this review I'm only halfway through The Two Towers, but seeing as how I haven't been able to find many reviews online I wanted to let people know how it is. If you're a fan, get it. It's a really good game and does the source material justice. There are little easter eggs in there that only big fans would get, like how Tom Bombadil is an unlockable character, and Peter Jackson makes a cameo in Bree (eating a carrot). I'm 30-years-old btw so you don't have to be a kid to enjoy this. Just don't expect ""Skyrim for kids"" or ""the best LOTR game ever"", but it's way better than most of the tie-in games that have been coming out in the last few years. I give it a 4/5.

UPDATE: I've now finished the Story Mode. It will take you about 9-12 hours depending on if you try to collect everything, but after you finish it tells you that you're only about 30% done with the game. Now you begin Free Play Mode and can now roam freely around Middle Earth collecting things and doing sidequests. There's also at least one bonus level (that I've discovered so far) that may be the best thing in the whole game...You get to play as Sauron, and the entire map of Middle Earth is now built out of LEGOs, not just the people. It's a lot smaller than in the Story Mode though. You go around with your mace and smash Minas Tirith, Edoras, Rivendell, Lothlorian, Bree, and Hobbiton into little LEGO bricks. The Mouth of Sauron follows you around as your companion. You can send the LEGO villagers flying with your mace...and there are sheep that you can ride around on as you spread your fear. So much fun. Anyway, it's a short game, but fun. The most open area in the game is Rohan/Gondor which is all one field but much too small for Rohan AND Gondor. You can see every landmark (Edoras, Helm's Deep, Isengard, Minas Tirith, and Mordor) on the horizon no matter where you're standing.",4.0

"This is an edited review... when I first reviewed the game, it was somewhat reactionary and I hadn't given it enough of a chance (I was greatly anticipating another DS Final Fantasy game with turn based play, and when it did not align with what I had pictured, I was initially let down). Though I still have some of the same issues that I did with it in the beginning, my opinion has greatly changed after I returned to the game and went on to finish it, logging over 100 hours of play.

Here's to an amazing, challenging, unique game to the portable final fantasy franchise. Its a must own for FF and DS rpg fans.

You can read more about the ""flaws"" or rather the things that other reviewers found problematic at length in other reviews, especially those that are 3 stars or below, but I will briefly go over them... the number one issue is the 15 item limit... Each character is allowed 15 items, which wouldn't be so bad if the 15 items didn't include your spells, weapon, armor, and equipable accessory, so really, it is an 11 item limit after your equipped items, and that 11 includes the spells you choose to equip and any extra you want to carry with you. That alone constitutes over half of the items you can carry. This is a strategic element and you must choose wisely and become adept at spell and item management together, and as you continue to play the game you become more accustomed to it and appreciate the challenge. Still, when you're only working with one or two characters at certain points in the game as opposed to three or four when you can spread it out with more ease, it can be annoying. Final word on that, though, I respected the added twist once I got used to it.

You can store items at local shops that will hold on to extra stuff for you. Again, it's less of an issue as you get used to tightly budgeting what items you take with you... the biggest pain is when you are on a longer mission and you run out of room to collect new items from treasure or win a new item from a battle that you would like to keep. As far as battle items won, when you are full, there is no option to swap out and discard an existing item for the new one. So, you have to be  well aware when you reach your maximum. You have 6 slots to fill with spells available for battle (although you can hold more and change your ""active"" spells).

It should be noted that only purchased spells fill up item carrying space - that is, you have other spells at your disposal depending on the ""crown"" you are wearing (equivalent to a profession, and you acquire more crowns as the story progresses and you defeat bosses, as well as other crowns for accomplishing optional challenges). With the gems that you acquire from battle, you can upgrade your crowns which adds additional spells to your disposal when wearing that crown, which, again, those spells are not added to your 15 item limit. Gems can also upgrade equipment such as weapons, armor and shields, and be sold for currency (gil) in order to purchase items, spells, equipment, etc.

There is a wifi multi player game option. Game battle, enemies, spells, weapons, armor etc. are also based on the elements of air, water, fire, earth, light, and dark. There are many accessories which block certain elements or statuses in battle such as paralysis, etc., upgrade certain statistics such as attack defense, magic attack, magic defense, intelligence, strength, etc.

Battle is based on HP - Hit Points, and also partially based on ""AP"" level (an acronym for ""Attack Points"")... Your AP level acts as both your spell and attack points, and you have a max of 5 AP. Stronger spells cost more AP, and you regenerate AP each turn. You can also use the item ""Ether"" - This regenerates your AP more quickly. A weapon attack takes only one AP point, whereas spells vary depending on their power. Sometimes you get caught in a bind where you have a character that has run out of AP during battle, in which you must choose the ""Boost"" command, which also doubles as defend, and allows you to regenerate AP.

The world map kind of stinks... it offers little help, as it is too general and small and often slightly inaccurate as to your exact location. You only start with a partial world map.

Overall, this is an 8 or 8.5. I rally enjoyed it despite some initial disappointment.

If you're going to include a world map you can access, make it something that marks towns, caves, etc., and isn't tiny. The world map in this game shows your location on this tiny image and doesn't indicate anything else useful. Plus, one of my favorite things about RPG's are maps. When a games map or mapping system stinks, it can almost ruin the game for me (although not that bad in this case).

All in all, the game deserves a better review than my original one, so that's what I decided to do. This game is worth buying for any turn based RPG fan, Final Fantasy fan, and DS RPG'er. A lot of fun overall.

"I had a lot of fun playing this game. I'm not an expert, by far, at this type of game playing; but, I didn't think it was too easy nor too hard. Graphics were nice, and I especially liked that you didn't have to walk to and fro, back and forth from room to room, to get to where you wanted to be. The map is great! The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that Gabriel promised to answer questions that the main character had at the end, but didn't. Of course, this may allow for more sequels, which would be great. I've played several Alawar games, and thus far, have enjoyed every one!",4.0
"First of all, I have played this game since launch. Yes the game is laggy, there are bots, and there is duping. But what is new for a diablo game. These were in diablo 1 and 2. Yes this game is no diablo 1 or 2. Yes the story sucks. Yes there is a pony level (Dumb). Yes you can only get to level 60 (EASY) and not a sense of accomplishment.

Regardless, the game is still actually fun at times. Not as fun as diablo 1 or 2. You don't feel that same sense of achievement when beating this game as the other two. As for inferno. Inferno is challenging. It causes the player to actually use skill and kite the enemies. Not just stand there and let the enemies hit you because you will be 1-2 shotted depending on act and class you are. If you are getting frustrated with inferno, go back to hell mode. Especially with NV stacks. Now you have to be even more careful not to die due to patch 1.03. Repair costs are very high. So the game actually takes skill. The game deserves a 3-4 star.

Also the announcer's tracks (the voice) repeat itself a LOT. They didn't need to have him repeat everything ever for the whole game, it got really annoying so that detracted from the score.

"I use this keyboard at work. With o-rings, this sounds very quiet and I'm a pretty fast typer, so imagine someone typing over 100 WPM on blues. Loud.

I really like the software. I don't see why this couldn't have been a single colored keyboard rather than just white. So, not pleased about that, but I knew going into this it was just going to be white. I like the feel of the cherry mx browns quite a lot.

The only thing I don't like is if you have oily fingers your keyboard is going to start looking pretty gross. It's been one day and my space bar looks like I rubbed french fry grease on it.

"Let me give you the bottom line before getting to the details.  If you hate messing with a lot of wires, have a need to play games without disturbing others in your house, and are not an audiophile, then this is a good product for you.  If you are an audiophile, you will likely not be happy.

Here are the details:

Setup is really easy and it really works quite well.  It is no longer stressful for me to get setup to play games when I need to do so while being quiet.  My wireless controller with this headset work really does the trick.

The reason you wouldn't want this product if you are an audiophile is that there is a constant white noise sound in the background.  It is actually somewhat similar to the white noise you get with noise canceling headphones, just a lot stronger.  Once you get used to it, you don't really notice it too much, though.

The headphones are quite lightweight and work well with my energizer rechargeable batteries.  The battery life seems pretty good, even with rechargeables.

I really like being able to independently control the mic volume and game volume.  The headset does a good job with keeping a constant level between them even when the game gets loud.  It took me a few games to get used to hearing my own voice, but now I actually like it.  I do however wish there was a way to turn off the microphone when you don't want it to be on.  I think that the lack of microphone kill switch contributes to the white noise (yes you can mute broadcasting to the xbox from the mic so other players don't hear you - however it still continues to pick up room noises and play them in your ears).

There is still the wire that connects the headset to the controller.  I don't find this to be an issue though.

Overall, I would buy this product again, because it really met my needs.  I had the X1 earforce, but the wires on it were just annoying.  I chose to give up a little sound quality in favor of not having to mess with the wires.  If this profile fits you and you are okay with pretty good sound, then you will probably be happy too.  Otherwise, you probably will be unhappy.

TIPS:

* Set this up with your receiver so that the broadcaster attaches to your receiver via the headphone jack on your receiver.  I simply use the adapter for the headphone output so that the mini-plug on this unit works with it.  I then have just the jack sitting next to the receiver with the rest of the wire winding around the back out of site and simply connect the headphone jack to the receiver when I want to use the wireless headset. This makes for almost hassle free switching between wireless broadcasting and normal speaker usage.

* If you have a receiver, check to see if it supports simulated surround sound over the headphone jack on it.  My Yamaha does (called silent cinema), which means that using the setup I described above allows me to still get simulated surround sound over the stereo speakers on this headset.",4.0

"I have to say that I didn't really have any clue what this game was when my friend talked me into buying it. Let me just say, ""IT's A WHOLE LOT OF FUN!"" There is not much of a story or any kind of depth to this game; it's pretty much a run around, dodge attacks, and blow up as much stuff as possible. Due to this fact and the repetitive nature of the game, certain people will not like it (I have another friend who hates it). I love it. It's pure destruction and bug killing with some alien aircraft and anime style mechas thrown in. In the fight to overcome the aliens you will destroy entire city blocks. On the more difficult settings you will have to work with your friends in order take down giant spiders, robots the size of skyscrapers, and space ships that continually dump more insects on you until you destroy them. There's a pretty generic leveling system which basically gives you access to more powerful weapons and increases your life. In my opinion - what's not to love?",4.0

"I played this game 3 times and enjoyed it thoroughly. It has a great story and musical score. The gameplay relies on you taking cover. You certainly can not go all ""Rambo"" on this game - definitely not on ""suicide mission"" or ""FUBAR"" difficulty. You will get torn to shreds. When you play on normal, explore the areas when safe. This will come in very handy when playing on harder difficulties.

I found no issues with ammo being scarce. It was plentiful for me. After a battle or wave of enemies you need to quickly collect some from the downed players and scurry back into cover. There are also hidden stashes in a few spots. You need to look around after all the enemies have been terminated to refill your ammo. One other tip is reload your weapon BEFORE using an ammo box. You will get more bullets that were in your clip and couldn't be filled otherwise.  Also after you die, and you will many times, go back and collect ammo from the boxes around. They all refill when you restart the checkpoint.

I enjoyed the variety of guns but mostly stuck with the M249 Saw and the M4 Carbine. As the game progressed to the later levels the SCAR with the grenade launcher is invaluable. In chapter 14 you will also get two outstanding guns that are extremely enjoyable to shoot and, in my opinion, necessary to complete the game on the two harder difficulties.

I enjoyed the grenade play also. You get frags, stickys, and flash grenades. Each have their own specific use. The flash grenades saved my life many times in the harder difficulty playthrough during the crazy battles of chapter 13 and 14. They give you a chance to shoot enemies while they are stunned. The stickys are invaluable for the ""heavies"" if you have good placement.

There are some choices you need to make in this game that affect gameplay. Figure those out when you play on normal difficulty. Later when you play suicide mission and FUBAR difficulty, you can avoid an ambush and if you choose stealth in one, you can avoid a ""heavy"" and probably the hardest battle of the game. You will only have to kill two enemies quietly.

My one problem with the game is your squads AI. At times they get ahead of themselves and go to far out in the zone and get ""downed"". There is no way to call them back to your spot. Now you have to get out of cover to revive them. Unfortunately you die while doing this a lot. Also, after reviving your team member, you sometimes get turned around and cannot slip right back into cover. This is pretty frustrating. When commanding your squad, make sure you don't send them too far in to battle. Take care of the closer enemies first. When your guys go down, you usually have a good amount of time before they bleed out so take your time and clear out as many enemies as you can before rescuing them. On the harder difficulties I cannot stress how much patience is important to success.

One of the most satisfying (and rewarding) part of the game is the execution animation. When an enemy is down wounded, you can go over him and use a dedicated button to execute him. It goes into a slo-mo animation of a gun shot to the head or you twisting the neck, smashing his head into the ground, and other good scenes like that. The rewarding part is you collect some ammo from each guy you execute.

I did not play the multiplayer so I cannot comment on that.

I think the game deserves a good ranking. Everyone has their own opinion and I would give this 5 stars because this is the type of game I enjoy. I take the game for what it is. I thought it was on par with 2012 games that don't have a ridiculous 9 figure budget. I deducted one star for the often silly and frustrating AI of your squad. Enjoy.",4.0
I have the ENTIRE Silent Hill collection. Literally. Every Silent Hill game from the PS One all the way to the XBOX 360. This one is really entertaining and I highly recommend it. You can always watch gameplay footage on youtube so that you can be your own critic.,4.0
"Let me start of by saying that all ratchet and clank games are a 5 out of 5!
But this collection is lacking. The company ""Idol minds"" who put these 3 ratchet and clank games together did a poor job. There is frequent lag and some different, or completely missing details in the games. I will start off with ""Ratchet and Clank Going Commando"" since it is the game I am the most familiar with on the PS2.

Going Commando will occasionally lag especially when there are multiple explosions at once, the original PS2 version never lagged for me no matter how many explosions were going on at once. But the lag doesn't happen too often. The original version had very few glitches, this version will glitch occasionally. A few times the camera will get stuck under the floor or in front of the character making it impossible to see what you need to see, and then you will need to completely stop the game and go back to the PS3 home menu before going back to normal gameplay.  The trash cans in one level will often dissapear when you hit them instead of breaking and falling over. One time the mini gun menu dissapeared and didn't come back until I restarted the whole game. But enough about lags and glitches, lets move on to the parts of the game that they removed!! On one planet there is a missle yard and there are tourists. The leader robot takes them on a tour. In the original game the robot would actually talk about each missle, however, in this collection the robot says nothing!!!! he just keeps moving.

Now onto the other two games that I am less familiar with.

Ratchet and Clank lags very often from explosions... try to remember that the whole point of this game is to blow stuff up! Every single time you use the missle launcher it lags!! This is hard for me to comprehend since the PS3 can easily handle a PS2 game... Darn you Idol Minds!

I have played Up Your Arsenal the least, but the spaceship sounds on the loading screen aren't even synced properly!!

Overall, I am not discouraging you from buying this collection, just be warned that it comes short of the greatness of the original PS2 versions.",4.0
"Certainly, this game is manageable in the right hands, but those who are novices to the world of video games or racing titles in general will struggle with the REALLY realistic feel of this Wave Racing game.

"This is a complete edit of my first review in which I only gave it one star. As mentioned in the title, the first console had the blue light issue right of the box and as you can imagine I was very pissed and disappointed but Amazon did the right thing (best customer service BTW) and sent me a replacement console right away. The second one works like a charm and it grew on me to the point where I felt that changing my review was the right thing to do. I like the redesigned controller a lot better than the PS3 controller but comparing it to the 360/Xbox one doesn't seem fair. For some games I feel the 360/One is a better controller (i.e.: FPS games) while others play a lot better on the PS3/PS4 (fighting games, arcade games). I also feel the design fits the 21st century (who in his right mind thought VCRs are still cool in 2014?) and looks a lot snazzier than the competition's. Launch games are of course a disappointment with only 2 exclusives currently available (Knack, Killzone Shadow Fall) but this doest make the XB One any better either (to be expected though). The software has been revamped (I had an unfortunate game crash while playing Killzone but the console didn't freeze), the interface looks a lot like the XMB but feels faster and more intuitive in some aspects. In others it lacks... It's still not clear to me how to close a game, If one can really be closed. Remote play is something I have yet to test.
Graphics are now on par with the modern PC but are not the leap we have experienced with the PS2->PS3 upgrade, the blu ray drive is indeed faster as well as loading times. Overall I believe the PS4 has given the XB One a good beating, numbers speak for themselves.",4.0

"I bought this remote because I habitually use my Xbox One to watch shows and movies on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. I saw the price of the official Microsoft Media Remote and said ""nope"". Seriously... $50 for a remote?! Being the reasonable person I am (and that you are since you are looking here), I went with this remote.

I am well pleased with the Talon Media Remote. There was absolutely no setup involved aside from placing the batteries inside it. I have read some reviews complaining that they had troubles with the remote's infrared getting to the console. Personally, this remote is working better than my Vizio TV remote. It may also help that my Xbox is on an open shelf of the TV stand with no interference such as cabinet doors.

The remote itself feels well-made. The material feels soft but has more than adequate grip. The entire backing comes off in order to add or replace batteries, which can be annoying to some, but it really makes the remote look nicer and it feels nicer to hold.

The remote also has a nifty backlighting so you can see in the darkest of times. Others have complained that the backlighting needs to sustain itself for just a little bit longer so they can find their desired button. I had experienced no trouble with that until I really needed the backlighting, and I couldn't agree more- hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

The Xbox ""Home"" button on the remote can turn on your Xbox which has completely eliminated my need for a controller when I just want to watch a movie or show. And the remote doesn't have to constantly be turned on and connected again when you haven't touched it for so long, unlike the Xbox controllers. That has been most handy for me.

If you want to use a simple, cheaper but well made remote to watch your shows and movies instead of your controller, this is an excellent option!

Hope I could help you with your decision. Godspeed.",4.0

"I got this game because I've always been curious about it and could never afford it when I was younger. It satisfied my curiosity but I won't be spending much time playing it.
Sadly instead of keeping the controls the same like Street Fighter did on the GBA by using the triggers for heavy kicks and punches, it used the triggers for grabs and mixes left and right kicks into a single button as well as combining left and right punches into a single button. This just about ruins the game.
I was impressed that they pretty kept the exact same engine as Tekken 3 on PSX, just lowering the graphics and frame-rate a lot. If they had just kept the controls the same, this could've still been a great game that would've been very similar to Tekken 3.",4.0

"Final Fantasy:

The Good -- This version of the game is fun. My wife and I had a blast playing and even leveling up (which, on the easy setting, wasn't often). The fights, dungeons, and boss encounters excited us to want to stay up a few extra hours to keep the game going.

The Bad -- The main characters have no pre-set character. My wife and I named each of the four and gave them our own backstories and such. While having no restrictions was freeing, I wondered why the heroes would even want to do good other than for goodness's sake, which is lame, but not enough to not recommend this game.

The Ugly -- I knew how to play only because I played the Nintendo original way back in the day. That was 20 years ago. I forgot a lot and even with the in-game clues, I was sometimes lost. Playing with a walkthrough helped immensely. A good game wouldn't need an external, unofficial aid. Using one felt like cheating, but was necessary at certain point because I had no idea where to go or what to do next. Just one blemish on a very good game.

Final Fantasy II:

The Good -- This game has a much more elaborate storyline than its predecessor. The characters are pretty one-note, but at least they have character.

The monsters are unique, surreal, and quite disturbing. That's where the Final Fantasy series shines, in its bestiary. I didn't cringe whenever I had a random encounter because I wanted to see what creep (or band of creeps) I'd have to fight. No, I cringed for an entirely different reason . . . .

The Bad -- Let's just skip to

The Ugly -- Final Fantasy II is unplayable due to its convoluted and not fun leveling system. In most Final Fantasy games, leveling the characters up is simple: just fight enemies. Here, you have to hone a particular skill. For instance, if you want someone to be proficient in using an ax in battle, they have to use an ax in battle . . . over and over and over. Magic users have it worse as they have to use their spells (which cost Magic Points) over and over to make them stronger.

This system allows a cheat of sorts, but the cheat is a time-drain that does nothing to inspire me to continue playing. I quit and have no desire to ever pick this up again.",4.0
"First let me say that this is one of the best golf games you can buy for the PC.  If you don't have any other TW title and money isn't the deciding factor then this is the one to get.  If you do have some of the more recent titles you may want to sit this title out.  If you are looking to enter into the TW universe and money is a factor you would probably be better off picking up 06 or 07 as the last three incarnations have been very similar and previous versions can be picked up at a much cheaper price.

For those that have some of the more recent PC versions of TW... they have made slight improvements over previous versions but I'd be hard pressed to say that they are anything that warrants buying it at the current full retail price. In some ways this is a good thing.  They didn't ""fix"" anything that wasn't broken.  Oh the other hand they didn't do much to merit the full retail price of a new game either. They've mixed up the presentation of the scenarios a bit this year but it really amounts to the same scenarios of the last 2 or 3 versions of the game.

I believe it was 05 when they had the scenarios separate from playing the legends (which were arranged in a pyramid).  The next version still had both but they were mixed together. Things really haven't changed since the version where they mixed them together... it's just that they update it with a new interface each year. One year it was time travel. This year it's a honeycomb.

The graphics have improved a bit but following in Maddens footsteps EA didn't take the PC version of the game to the next generation's level.  My now somewhat dated PC can still run the game quite smoothly so I can only assume that they are doing this to ensure that those of us with older computers can still play the game.  I guess I have somewhat mixed feelings on this.  It would be nice to have next gen graphics but not at the expense of not being able to play it without massive upgrades.  It seems like they could have developed it with paths for older systems to run it at reduced levels while giving those with better rigs the ability to take it to the next level.

I haven't noticed any difference in the game face character design going on a 3rd year now. I don't think they've even so much as added a new hair style or single piece of extra clothing.  I haven't seen the new feature that allows you to import your face yet.  I believe it is absent from the PC version.  That and the absence of next generation graphics may push many to opt for getting one of the console versions of this game.

Experience points develop your attributes using the same system as '07.

Sad to say that the commentary is the exact same as the previous 3 or 4 years. ""You've gotta be happy with that birdie, you've got to be happy with any birdie"" ""What do you see? I see a straight shot, 150 yards to the hole, and I see dead people"" (yes, they've probably been doing that one since the movie came out in '99).  It's pretty bad when they don't even update the commentary parts that date it to a movie that came out 8 years ago.

They've changed the on course HUD to match the game's honeycomb motif. One improvement that I did like was the honeycomb that is dedicated to telling you the current distance that your club will hit the ball. In previous versions you had to mouse over the club selection, adjust your shot, re-mouse over the club selection to see what your adjustment did, and repeat until you got it right. Now when you adjust your shot the distance is updated right on the screen. No more back and forth.  This is the only feature that really made an improvement on the game for me.

The other new feature is the confidence meter.  I haven't found it to be very useful.  The HUD seems to be just as touchy as it has been in previous years.  When using the click golf swing method you have to take extreme care to make sure you don't accidentally initiate your golf swing when doing things like changing clubs, adjusting your shot, or changing the shot type.

You also have the ability to jump right into the FedEx playoff.  That didn't appeal to me too much since you play tournaments all the time in PGA mode.  It didn't really add to the game.

This is a fun game for me.  For those that haven't experienced TW, pick it up.  For those that have you'd probably be better off waiting for a price drop.  If next gen graphics are your thing, definitely go with one of the console versions.",4.0

"This is a fantastic game with many revolutionary changes never before seen in video games.  The most obvious is the advanced face recognition software that was used to capture even the slightest facial movements for you to determine if the suspect is lying or telling the truth.  I love how the game is broken up into separate cases, but in addition, there's also a contection from one case to another, adding another layer to victims who have similar M.O.'s.  The details in every clue become very important.  And all of these factors are thanks to the advancements in graphics and HD gaming.

The mini-cases add a little variety so it's not soley one case at a time.  Just like a GTA game, you can enter any car you want and say it's for ""police business"" but doing this too much will take away from your intergrity.

Though I haven't completed the game yet, I'm worried that the cases are still too easy.  The notebook your character keeps organizes the clues for you, but almost too well.  It doesn't really leave much room for you to do anything thinking on your own.  And even if you completely botch an interview, you'll still figure out who the suspect is because they're the one running away.  It would have been nice to have different difficulty levels to add more of a challenge for those who wanted it.

Perhaps the game's biggest flaw is its lack of replay value.  Your only motivation to go back and re-play a case is to try and get more questions right to get more stars.  But after the criminal is behind bars, why would you?  Understandably, it's hard to make a game like this that could be replayed since all the clues are pointing to one person in particular.

Of course, the game is not without flaws, but the 40's LA feel (complete with music), graphics, and game play still make it very enjoyable and completely different than most other games on the market.  My hope is that Rockstar will add on to this amazing start and we'll soon see additions similar to what they did with GTA IV.

UPDATE - 5/3/12

Now that I've completed the game and the retail price has been reduced, I thought I'd come back and add to my first review.  I'll agree with most reviews in that cases are repeatative, the outcome of a case doesn't change the story at all, and now that the game is beat, it sits on my shelf unplayed.  When I first played this game, I had it on the ""easy"" mode where the controller shakes when you're near a clue and the music changes when you've found them all.  This makes the game extremely easy, but I wonder how difficult it would have been without this support.  However, now that the price has been reduced to $20, I think it may be worth your money.  I think my initial review (and perhaps some of the others out there) would be very different if I hadn't bought it so soon at full price.  I think when you consider the price, the value is now worth it.",4.0

"I went from a wireless six-button mouse to this wired gaming mouse, and I have to say the difference is significant. Where my wireless would do weird things like not recognizing clicks until I moved the mouse, and dropping out every once in a while, this wired mouse with increased resolution never does either of those things. It's incredibly responsive, and makes me glad I decided I could ""live with"" having a cord on my mouse.

The buttons are handy, and easy to reach. The feel is a little more blocky than I'm used to, but it's still comfortable. The mouse just feels like it's tracking far better than any I've used in a long time-- There's no ""jumpy"" feel to it in lower DPI settings, and less of one in the high setting than on my wireless mouse. It's kind of cool that I can switch DPI on the fly with a button.

In games, I noticed my response time was better, especially for circle-strafing and mouse-looking. While I'm not a huge FPS gamer, I did get some better control with this mouse in Team Fortress 2, and I felt a HUGE improvement in the way the mouse felt for Oblivion. Clicking on small icons and buttons on the in-game GUI isn't as tedious with the Sidewinder X5.

I use it in both OS X and Windows XP. Despite what the package says, the mouse does, indeed, come with drivers and control panels for OS X (not that OS X needs drivers, but the control panels are handy to assign buttons).

There's one button that I find sort of stupid and useless on this mouse. It's near the back (under your palm, when the mouse is being used) and its purpose varies depending on what OS you're using. It's not reassignable, either. It does what it does, and that is all. In Windows XP, all it does is launch the Intellimouse software; That's the mouse control panel, which you can normally reach two other ways (click the desktop/Start menu icon, or go to Control Panel). That's all it does. I hardly see why a button was needed for this function. In OS X, the button just pops your pointer up to the top left corner of the screen, and again, you can't reassign this button. It's just sort of a waste of moving parts, if you ask me.

However, stupid button aside, I dig this mouse. I think I may stick with it, despite losing wireless freedom compared to my old mouse. This mouse just works better!

Oh, I should mention that this mouse has two red lights on the bottom, near the back, and one on top. They remain on as long as your computer is sending power to the mouse, and this might be annoying for some people who don't want their mouse to be all lit up. It doesn't bother me much, but it is curious that Microsoft would put bright red lights on the mouse when the laser tracking emits light that is invisible to the human eye. These lights aren't part of the tracking hardware: They're just decoration. I guess it's supposed to look cool or something. I just think it's sort of a waste of power.

A good mouse, but not for the office or conservative desktop. Definitely a step up for gamers, though.",4.0

"So, I hadn't played the other Theaterhythm games, and I basically bought this because I was bored and had some money burning a hole in my pocket. Turns out, I was pleasantly surprised! The game is basically Rock Band with a Final Fantasy soundtrack and a couple different ways of interacting with the controls. It has multiple play modes available that change the best way to interact with the songs, and a thin veneer of a storyline that does an adequate job of explaining and justifying why you have the main characters from 17 different games making music while fighting bad guys.

The repetitive nature of the game makes it hard to play more than a couple songs at a stretch before getting a bit bored, but the length of the songs and the style of the game makes it pretty clear that the designers realized this as well and set up the game in such a way that you can pick it up and play for the length of a car ride, ferry ride, plane trip, or spell in a waiting room and then close it up and come back later without missing a beat.",4.0

"I once tried the game ""Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front"" and it was quite good, if not complicated and difficult. But ""Zone of the Enders"" puts that game to utter shame. The powers and weapons that you receive for the Orbital Frame (giant robot) are awesome and the way it moves is incredible. You gain control of the Orbital Frame called Jehuty and you basically battle against a whole bunch of other Orbital Frames. Most of them aren't that challenging at first, but later the enemies receive upgrades and become considerably tougher. The leaders are a whole other story.
There are about 5 other Orbital Frames that Jehuty must face off against: Tempest, Tyrant, Nebula, Neith, and finally Anubis. Tempest and Tyrant are very large and powerful and Nebula is kind of like a huge jet Orbital Frame. Neith and Anubis however are very similar to Jehuty: bipedal, very fast, powerful, etc. The story of the game, which is quite good, revolves around a young boy named Leo Stenbuck who lives in a space colony outside of Jupiter called Antilia. After he accidentally gains control of Jehuty, he has to deliver the machine to the people who created it in order to keep an invading army of Orbital Frames from acquiring it. Leo then meets up with his remaining friend Celvice and along with Jehuty's AI system codenamed ADA, faces off against the invading army while also defending innocent civilians from destruction.
Another good thing about this game is the controls. They are very easy to remember and are not complicated at all. The only thing you should know is that to use the special weapons you acquire throughout the game, all you have to do is press the circle button (the game doesn't really tell you how to do that unless you read the manual). Jehuty is much more powerful than any Zaku or Gouf you may control in those Gundam games and is not nearly as difficult to control. The only thing I don't like about this game is how you have to go back and forth basically all the time in order to accomplish missions, and sometimes you might find yourself wandering about thinking ""what was I supposed to do?"" or ""where do I look for that program?"". As long as you keep your cool and read the objectives and hints listed in the MISSION area of the pause menu, then you'll do just fine.

"Sega definitly had a good thing going when they were still marketing this system. Not only did it have a backlit screen (an 11(!) year old system having a backlit screen...are you listening Nintendo?), it also had a slew of great games, and a really cool design. I took mine to school a couple of weeks ago (freakin' finals.) and people were actually willing to trade their GBA's for a few precious minutes with my Game Gear! That's amazing. Even though I only have 3 games now (I actually had about 10 but I let somebody 'borrow' most of them about 5 years ago and he never gave them back), it's still fun to play.
  But, with every system, there's always a few drawbacks. To start, this thing is BIG. No, it's HUGE, and it gets even bigger when you use a battery pack. Next, the sound isn't great, it's only decent, and it doesn't get much better with headphones. Lastly, if you buy used games, test them FULLY before you buy (with Sonic 1&2 on mine, I have to leave the cartridge sticking out about 1 or 2 mm., or it won't even play at all).  But overall, I've had a lot of fun with my Game Gear over the last decade, especially with the Sonic titles, and I plan to have even more fun until my system finally gives up. Would I recommend it? In a word, yes. If you can get around the fact that it is huge, and that it is basically dead, you and your Game Gear can, and will, have a long, happy life together. I guarantee it.",4.0

- You can play while the PSP is into the case.

Cons:
- In order to use the USB port you have to open the case, but still, there's little to no-space to plug a cord. And if you manage to plug one, it feels like you are forcing the port, which might cause some wear in it.
- It's hard to pull out the screen protector. It can get a little bit tricky.

Overall:
Buy if you don't intend to take out the PSP too often, and love how this case looks.",4.0

"I got this for christmas, and I've enjoyed it thoroughly. The way you pick which side you want to be on(good or bad) is fun, but I don't like how it ends up the same either way you go. It has a little language, but nothing deep. The gameplay and graphics are pretty nice. Overall, the game is pretty good.

"I've bought this game, because I'm a Mortal Kombat-fan. Midway Arcade Treasures 2 has Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 and I enjoy these games. Other games are not interesting I only play Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 on MAT2. Also the graphics are very good. And both MK-games run very quickly. Buy it !!! Only in Mortal Kombat 2: If you want to know Kitana's ""kiss of death""-fatality; press and hold LK (low kick) then type forward twice, down, forward and release LK.",4.0

"I'm a die-hard fan of the Dragon Warrior series to the point where i contacted Square-Enix via instant messenger and told them of my ideas for Dragon Warrior Monsters 3. Due to copyright issues, i wasn't successful. After having played Dragon Warrior Monsters 2: Tara's Adventures, I desperately wanted this game. I managed to get a used version, and as of now have put a total of 55 hours into the game. This game is a very long game. It's not hard, but a majority of the time spent in this game is for training. The goal of this game is to rescue your sister Milayou who was kidnapped by Warabou some stupid looking monster. In order to save you sister, you must get and train an army of monsters and win all the classes especially the S class to enter the tournament where if you win, you get to make a wish (which is obviously to save your sister). This is how I rated this game:

GRAPHICS:10/10
MUSIC:10/10
REPLAY VALUE:1/10
GAMEPLAY:5/10
OVERALL:3/5

However, this is one of many games that has a very bad replay value. However you don't have to re-play this game, you could just either train or compete again in anything. The only problem with this gamne is there are no other side quests like in Dragon Warrior Monsters 2. That makes the game boring while you train. the only problem that got me away from this game. Well that's all I gotta say.",4.0
"First off, the best part of the Crackdown games is collecting orbs!  Don't get me wrong, it's fun to pick up cars and throw them, but orb collecting is where it's at.  It's fun to figure out how to get to the top of buildings and other structures to reach the orbs.  As you level up your agility, you can jump higher to reach places you couldn't before.  You have to backtrack at times to reach orbs you've passed before.  It can be a chore, but if you're a completionist, you'll find a lot to do in this game.

Crackdown 2 plays just like the first Crackdown.  The graphics are cel-shaded, so it looks like you're in a comic book.  Don't expect Alan Wake or Dead Space quality graphics in this game!  Gameplay is just like the original.  You run around, powering up your abilities such as strength, driving, guns, and agility.  Orbs scattered around the city help increase your skill levels.

New to Crackdown 2 are freaks.  They are mutated people who've been infected.  You learn more about them in the intro.  The terrorist group in Crackdown 2 is called Cell.  I haven't gotten far enough to find out if there are multiple factions like in the first Crackdown.

I've played a variety of missions.  In the first mission, you have to reach a drop point and secure it by killing the Cell terrorists.  Another mission I've completed was securing collectors for the power beacon, which is used against the freaks.

There is a variety of weapons in Crackdown 2, you get automatic rifles, shotguns, pistols, rocket launchers, etc.  There are energy weapons in this game, which is new from the first Crackdown.  I received a UV shotgun which does heavy damage to multiple freaks at close to medium range.  The freaks disintegrate into a yellow/orange fire when you destroy them.

If you've played and enjoyed the first Crackdown, you'll like Crackdown 2.  Don't expect an big improvement in graphics or gameplay.  There are some added abilities and weapons which keep things fresh, in addition to the freaks, so it's not just a rehash of the original, although it takes place in the same city.

If you're new to Crackdown, don't expect a blockbuster AAA title with Crackdown 2.  For what it is, Crackdown 2 is a really fun game.  As I stated before, the fun is collecting the different orbs and powering up your character.

One thing to note is that the lock-on targeting is sort of hokey.  If an enemy is standing next to a vehicle or barrel, sometimes it'll lock-on to the object instead of the enemy.  I only use lock-on targeting when there are a lot of enemies coming after me.  You can also aim freely to pick your targets.  With the lock-on targeting, you can move the right thumbstick to select different body parts such as head, arms, and legs of enemies.  It's a nice feature, but I rarely use it because it slows you down when there are tons of enemies on screen.",4.0
"This game is a definite improvement over the first game.  The story feels much smoother, and this time I actually care what happens to the main character.

Pros
1.  This game is rare when it comes to sequels because it's actually better then it's predecessor.  The characters actually have some depth to them this time.  There is vast character development on all of the characters.
2.  The upgrading of your compound, and buying better equipment to help with your missions was a great addition to the series.
3.  The villains this time felt like they were actually evil where as the last time the villains weren't good they seemed like big pansies.

Cons
1.  The fighting gets repetitive at some times, but that can be overlooked by the awesome story.
2.  The collecting of items is back again, and I hate that crap it's so ANNOYING.  If your going to have collecting of feathers please give a map at least.

Overall this game is taking this series in the right direction.  There is 2 other sequels out there that have gotten good reviews, and I planned to play them in the future and give you heads up if there good.  I got some other games that I got to beat, so I have to put those two on the back burner I guess.  8.8/10.

"Just Cause 2 is a fun game. I personally enjoy open-world games, so this immediately appealed to me. The game has great graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics and lots to do.

"I've been playing Dance Central 2, Dance Central (original), and Just Dance 3 pretty non-stop recently. How does Dance Central 2 stack up against its prequel and the Just Dance 3 game?

First, let's look at the enhancements over Dance Central. The graphics are naturally much better. The characters look better and move more smoothly. I love the new venues far more than the old ones. The beach is my favorite, although I wish they didn't cut to a basketball court half the time. The characters are good. Songs you bought for Dance Central are available here with the same moves.

The exercise mode is improved - you now get playlists of songs arranged by the intensity of the workout. So you can go through a 20 minute easy set to get going. You can also make your own playlists - awesome! It will give you alerts when you hit milestones, like 50 calories or 20 minutes - but you get no running tally as you go. So I do miss that.

They lost the sense of a level progress as you play. Instead, they added a challenge mode where you ""take on"" a given dance crew by playing their songs. I'm not keen on this since there are songs I just don't like in the set. I'd rather be able to play the songs I want to.

They now have a 'helper frame' to see where you are in the Kinect view square, which helps keep you in the camera frame. This is especially helpful if you're playing two player at a time.

You can use voice commands to control the songs, which is fun.

So definitely if you have the original Dance Central I'd look into upgrading. You can even import your old songs for a fee, so you'd get double the songs here.

Now to compare it with Just Dance 3. The characters here in Dance Central 2 are still fairly robotic, and the moves can feel forced. Transitions between moves aren't always smooth. There are only the few venues and characters. This definitely gets kudos for its playlist functionality; I wish Just Dance 3 offered that.

Just Dance 3 lets *four* people play at once in cool choreography that is smooth and gorgeous, and in general the dancing is much more fluid. Where this one has robotic move-leg-left and lift, with Just Dance 3 they are real people jumping and spinning and as I love jumping songs I miss that a lot here.

A key issue for me is song selection. As I say on all my dance reviews, we all have different tastes in music. That's fine and natural, so the games we gravitate towards will be guided by that. I love the song mix in Just Dance 3 and I'm just not that same level of fond of the songs here in Dance Central 2. So if I'm going towards the TV and looking to pop a game in, I'll reach for Just Dance 3 instead because of the song mix and the fluid moves.

Still, if you adore these songs, then you'll be drawn to this one for the same reason, and you won't mind the semi-robots you're following.

So well recommended for people who love this song mix. If you're 50-50 between the two song mixes, I might lean towards Just Dance 3 - or heck, get them both and have double the songs to play with.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions; I play these a lot.

I bought this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.",4.0
"First off, im a huge fan of Wii sports.  I think it's the only game that's consistently in my Wii.  That being said, I wanted to try another tennis game that took advantage of the Wii controller.  Sega Superstars tennis fits the bill.

Sega Superstars tennis can be played in several modes, most of which are pretty similar to any other sports game: tournament, single-match, multiplayer, etc.  The mode that I have been busy playing is the Superstars Mode where you play certain missions based on other Sega games of the past.  By doing the missions you unlock new characters, music, courts, and other stuff.  It is a great time and will keep you busy for a long time trying to unlock everything.

There are four ways to control the game on the Wii: 1. The Wii remote held like a tv remote  2. The Wii remote plus the nunchuck  3. The Wii remote held horizontally  4. A classic controller  I found the Wii remote plus the nunchuck to be the best.  You swing the raquet with the Wii remote just like Wii Sports tennis but with the nunchuck you get to move your character around the court rather than let the system move for you.  I enjoy being able to move myself where I want way better than how it was in Wii Sports.

The graphics are pretty good.  Not exactly amazing for the Wii, but pretty average.  If you have been playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl lately, these graphics may disappoint a bit, but the gameplay definitely makes up for the graphics.

The one thing the Wii version is missing that the other systems got is online multiplayer.  Im not sure why they left it out, but that is one downfall the game has.  Playing local multiplayer is a good time though.

I've only spent a few hours with the game but already I can tell im going to be playing it for a while.  The controls are great, the characters are fun, and unlocking stuff is a good time.  If you enjoyed Wii Sports Tennis and are looking for more, give this game a shot.  You will definitely enjoy it!",4.0
"Fallout 3 is a long game. But it's fun and you wouldn't want a short game, especially if it was sixty dollars. There is also a lot of variety in the game.
 First is the people, some are wealthy and have nice clothes and some have dirty overalls and are homeless and hungry. Second is the creatures, or aliens, there are super mutants that have hatred and envy and are everywhere in the game, there is also raider which would love nothing more than to kill you on sight. Third is the quests and karma, there is a lot of quests in Fallout in a lot of locations, which means you do a lot of traveling. You can sometimes loose karma by doing bad quests and bad things, and gain karma by doing good things and being good.
 At the beginning you live life in Vault-Tec Vault 101 after the Great Nuclear War of 2277. When you find out your dad left the sealed shut door of the vault, you have to chase after him in the ""Capital Wasteland"" which is what use to be Washington D.C, before the war. Later inn the game you find out why you dad left, because he needed to finish a science project called ""Project Purity"" which is exposed to create purified water for the world and he needs your help with it. When the ""Enclave,"" a group of scientists that try to help the world but everyone thinks they are up to no good.

"This game packs alot of hours into it, that's for sure. In fact, that may be part of the downfall. My only complaint is there wasn't enough to do in the amazingly HUGE cities; There are only so many types of missions, so a little more variation and weapon upgrades(more so than offered...)would have been nice.

That being said, this game looks fantastic and controls just as well. there are some target issues when it comes to intense combat, but not too big of a deal. You can effortlessly flee on rooftops, jumping left and right without a care, the game flowing with just about everything you actually meant to do control-wise.

The story is complex but interesting, and the game can unfold at your own pace. You can explore, climb, collect, save citizens, ride horses, or just fight; Just expect to be in for at least 15-20 hours.  Assassin's Creed is a nice take on a familiar genre, playing more in the realms of reality than say the 'magic powers' and 'flame-throwing sword'realm. It's def. refreshing, and the time-travel bits were a pretty cool surprise.

A solid, well-made, hassle free fun experience. Although it would have been awesome to see the cities at NIGHT instead of all being in the day. Oh well. Maybe next time.",4.0
"With this title in the Sims series, there is an emphasis on the community lot play. Personally, I prefer to just play my own family at my own house with little interaction with neighbors. The ability to buy things in the shops is a fun feature, but it has just never appealed to me all that much. Overall, I think the Pets expansion pack offers more new, fun features.",4.0
"I like the funkiness of the design. On its own, without the PS4 controllers plugged in it's reminiscent of a Cylon spacecraft from Battlestar Galactica (the new version).  When plugged into a power source (such as your PS4) it gently pulsates through a rainbow's variety of colors - it really looks good in a darkened room.

As far as functionality goes this product is fairly simple but it does what it's supposed to do and that is charge two of your PS4 controllers simultaneously. A really nifty product for those who utilize 2 or more controllers on the reg (product sample provided for review).",4.0
"It isn't Fallout 3 or in anyway Fallout 4 for that matter, but it is a good enough game. I hadn't really been a devoted fan of the series though I stumbled on to Fallout 3 when it was re-leased and thought ""wow this is awesome!"" and it was. Still is actually New Vegas although similar is not the same, but it is a good game you will have many hours of game play and unique ways to go about it. Now if you played fallout 3 then you know about the whole Karma thing, in this it isn't so much a big deal rather than how you interact with certain people, and what you do for them it's more about your reputation. The graphics are great or at-least they are on my computer. See where as Fallout 3 was kinda green and mostly apocalyptic looking this is more Wild West and Howdy Partner haha and that is alright. Seeing how it takes place in a desert that works, to me it got a little old after a while though. But the missions are fun and it's a better way to kill an afternoon than watching TV or at least I think it is, keep in mind in Fallout New Vegas instead of your enemies depending on your game level like FO3, they are just programed to be there whether you are ready for them or not. I hope I was helpful Happy Gaming!!",4.0
"Onimusha is very good, but let me say this:  I saw everything this game has to offer in 1 five day rental.  I actually played through it TWICE.  I had fun, was blown away by the graphics, but after I returned the game I never thought of it again.
Onimusha can be compared to Resident Evil because it basically that same game only set in medival Japan.  Anyone who has played the RE series will certainly feel some deja vu.  You play a samuri warrior who must rescue a princess from a castle over run by zombies.  The graphics are beautiful but are still the same static shots.  However, the player models and little touches of smoke and such really make everything blend in together and seem more alive.  Combat is simple yet strategic and very fun, although it gets old after the second run thru.  Still, I enjoyed myself better than shooting zombies.  There are a few puzzles in the game, but nothing too hard.  The story, though, is very very simple, and a bit of a letdown.  You can tell they cut parts of the game to release it on time.
I consider Onimusha a part of the Resident Evil series because it is SO similiar to those games.  Definitely rent it if you own a PS2, but I think you money is better saved for RE:Code Veronica...",4.0
"""Ninja Gaiden 2"" probably will not be remembered very fondly.  A game blighted by terrible camera, cheap difficulty-raising tricks, and a game engine generally hailing from the previous generation of consoles, NG2 nevertheless has enough of the magic dust of its XBOX predecessor to make it a fully worthwhile purchase.

Everything about ""Ninja Gaiden 2"" is intimidating.  From the sturm und drang Tecmo video intro sequence to the final boss fight, the game retains the fearsome seriousness and difficulty of 2004's ""Ninja Gaiden"". That game was possibly the greatest action adventure of the 3D era.  To attain success, ""Ninja Gaiden 2"" has to follow that and add the requisite gloss of current-gen gaming, whilst fixing the original's annoying camera and tweaking the controller-damaging difficulty level.  In this regard, NG2 is a failure: the graphics are often bland and barren, the camera sits too close to the player character, and the admittedly lessened difficulty is soured in many places by cheap hikes in difficulty which the player cannot possibly avoid.

However, there is a big ""but"".  The gameplay is as thrilling as NG, as beautifully detailed and rewarding as the rest of the game elements are shoddy and perplexing.  While the sequel incorporates close-up Obliteration moves to kill wounded enemies and a regenerating health-bar (a nod to making the game more accessible), it is still fundamentally the same game engine as the original...but more.  More blood, more fighting, more all-round violence.

The point is that the wonderfully fluid and responsive controls actually make the gamer feel in control of a master ninja. It makes you feel proud to have accomplished a tough boss fight or to have countered an enemy attack.  This element alone makes this charismatic game worth paying serious attention to.  And, having played such cutscene-heavy games as Metal Gear Solid 4 recently, NG2's non-stop action shines particularly brightly for me; the game represents a big gold star in favour of action gaming.  Perhaps having realised this, Tecmo have gutted out the often tedious and obtuse puzzles from Ninja Gaiden in favour of added enemies.

To be clear, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a deeply flawed videogame.  There are plenty of elements to the game which are not really good enough.  In keeping with Team NINJA's Mount Fuji logo, the game is either peaks or troughs.. The peaks are fantastic, and the troughs are ""fantastic"", too.  The camera, it must be stressed, is awful, locking up terribly especially in tight corridors and on flights of stairs.  Graphically, the game has bland backgrounds, although the detailed character animations make up for this in large part.  The story is the usual tosh about armageddon that game developers so love, with demons and devils spewing terrible dialogue -just ignore them.  But Ninja Gaiden 2 has the magical charisma of a game which just knows it is special, that can treat you badly because it knows you will come crawling back.",4.0

"i didn't like this game when i first saw it at E3, but when i went back  and played it, it turned out to be pretty good. Not too many boss monsters  (i hate those things), some of the monsters are rather agile, the weapons  are new, the graphics are extremely pretty (nice colors, great water), you  can configure all sorts of things, there are some good guys to help you out  (they show you hidden goodies) and the game makes a lot of effort to be  stable. Hey, they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a  feel for the story.
It's not as story-scripted as Half-Life (but then, it  doesn't have the awful Xen world either), and many people prefer the  realistic weapons of Quake to the unusual ones of Unreal. i like the  built-in bots in multiplayer (i think this was the first game to ship with  them), but i'm told the net play is really slow",4.0

"Basically, this is a KOF 2002 clone with a bunch of tweeks to it.  What I mean by ""tweeks"" is that a good deal of the existing characters that were in 2002 had their stats modified a little bit as well as a few combo changes.  Not to mention that the new groove system for Neowave also disturbs some of the balance in the character rooster.  I won't go in depth about character tiers in this game.  Go visit some fighting game boards if you want that.  But basically, this is just a diffrent flavor of KOF 2002.  No more and no less.

Now for a few facts and tidbits about this particular version of the game.  The US XBOX version of the game is missing Angel and May Lee.  They are only in the Japanese PS2 version.  Furthermore, the Japanese PS2 version does support online play from what I see on the box.  Not to mention that the standard PS2 controller is much better suited for fighting games then the standard XBOX controller and it's fairly obvious which version is supierior.

The only problem with the PS2 import is that you either need a flip-top, slider card, or MOD Chip to play it and that the cheapest [...].

However, after saying this, if you already have a modded PS2 and are looking to pick up this game, get it imported.  It's not really because of the two extra hidden characters as it is about the PS2 being more fighter-game friendly.  It's the standard for them.  And while $35 is quite a jump compared to the price of $15, well...that's just my personal preference.  And I know for a fact that I'm not the only one that has problems with XBOX ports to 2D fighters.  And, at least, you are not paying $70-$80 for the PS2 import for King of Fighters XI, $65-$75 for the PS2 import of Samurai Shodown 0, and $60-$70 for the PS2 import of NeoGeo Battle Collosium.",4.0
"If you like bright, colorful graphics and a story line with a sunny disposition then this is the game for you! Mario makes his return to the Nintendo console in this cheery game which pits Mario against an enemy who looks an awful like Mario himself!

Mario and the Princess are only looking for a little rest and relaxation (and a lot of food in Mario's case), when suddenly after they land on Island Delfino Mario is arrested and put in jail for apparently defiling the beautiful island paradise. But lo and behold Mario hasn't done anything wrong! What's a hero to do? Well, go out and clean up the mess while trying to figure out who has framed him!

The gameplay takes Mario to many different areas of the island all with their own difficulties and obstacles. Mario's goal throughout the game is to find the sunshine sprites which have scattered due to the uncleanliness of the island.

This game provides quite a few hours of fun and enjoyment although there were times when the game ceased to hold my attention due to what I felt were repeats of challenges for Mario. Overall however, a great game and essential one for your Gamecube collection.",4.0
"Mass Effect 1 is my favorit game on the Xbox 360 and I've played all other Bioware games. KoToR, Jade Empire, Neverwinter Nights are all 5+ Stars games. But this game is a litte bit different. They cut off many role play elements and this game have much more (shooter) action than all other Bioware games (not my flavor but ok).

But there are two points that make me really disappointed.

First, Bioware censored the sex scenes in this part. There were a ridiculous discuss on Fox News in the USA and in Singapore about the first part whereas the rest of the world don't care about it.

And second, this part could be sponsored by Marlboro. Several characters are smoking. Humans and Aliens they all have nothing better to do as smoke cigarettes.

Why 4 Stars?

The characters are great and the dialogues are fantastic. The Normady is much bigger but the elevator scences are much faster. They improved the side quests (I miss the Mako) and the graphics. And Mass Effect 2 is still a great game.

But I don't like the new inventar and the new mini game to scan a planet.",4.0
"Created by a little know developer called Camelot (they made some Mario Golf and Mario Tennis games, as well as Shining Force before they joined Nintendo), Golden Sun is one of the GBA's more exceptional games.

Golden Sun has one major achievement it had for the GBA.  It pushed the limits of the system in terms of graphics.  While the visuals for wandering around seem rather easy for the system to create, the battles are a spectacular achievement.  Even though the characters and enemies are shown as animated sprites.  The sprites themselves are not much to write home about, but regardless they are quite convincing and suit the battle setup more than you might expect.  The battle screen is sort of a ""quasi-3D"" setup.  The background and sprites are 2D, but they are executed in such a manner that they look 3D.  Not only that, battle effects, such as spells and simple attacks, add wonderfully to the setup.  The only real problem I can see is that some spell effects slow down the framerates (how fast or smoothly it runs) noticably, but it's all handled so well that it doesn't even seem like a glitch, and out of sheer irony it adds to the effect of some of the spells (hence, it may have been done that way on purpose).

The sound is a mixed bag.  The music score part is excellent.  Everything from the main menu music, to town themes, and the grand world map music is great both technically and melodically.  If any songs do get on your nerves, they either won't last long or are done in such a way that you can tune them out while playing.  Sound effects, however, are very standard.  A lot of them are recycled so much that it's practically mind numbing.  However, none of it seems completely out of place, and there isn't much that will hurt your ears, so that's something to be happy for.

The gameplay itself only has one real flaw in my opinion.  The battles are too easy.  With the exception of most of the boss battles, regular battles tend to be so easy that the thought of using the run option will never occur to you (they also go so quick that there's not really a time issue involved either).  There's also an issue where, if you set all of your characters to attack one enemy and that enemy is destroyed, the characters that attack him later have their attack wasted.  This really isn't too much of an issue, though, and Camelot was smart enough to make the character automatically defend if that should happen (which means damage to that character would be halved... though I think that only refers to physical damage).

The story has gotten a lot of bad press in my opinion.  However, it should be noted that if you play this game, the story alone may persuade you to buy the next game, GS: The Lost Age (which is already out).  While that's not particularly a bad thing, as the combination of the two stories is really awesome, just be aware of the extra expense that may cost for your wallet.  Also, it should be noted that this game is a bit on the short side (roughly 20-25 hours), but that's still not much of an issue in my view (just so you know, the second game in the series is roughly 40-45 hours long, so that one is lengthier).

All in all, the game is quite fun.  However, there are a few quirks that I mentioned above that may get on some people's nerves, so just know what you're getting into.",4.0

"I was looking to replace my broken Xbox 360 headset which lasted me quite a while to be honest.

I wanted to order a new headset online as I was sure I could save money compared to in-store prices. I looked around and found this set for a total of about $7. After looking at the volume control (attachment) I realized this headset was for the original Xbox and not the Xbox 360. When buying, I was looking quickly and just saw the seller as Microsoft and a genuine Microsoft product....didn't even realize they still had original, first Xbox merchandise for sale.

Anyways, I left the volume attachment in the bag and plugged in the wire directly into the Xbox 360 controller. It worked. Even though I can't control the volume any longer (since the headset is for the first Xbox and the attachment doesn't fit), the sound seems clear and just right.

Can't control the volume on the headset, but it works great with the Xbox 360. No need to return it, specially for the price.",4.0

"UPS delivered my PS4 bright and early on Friday and then I had to wait an interminable 7 hours before actually getting to hook the thing up.  I knew that there was a day one update that was mandantory before I could really do anything and that is where I ran into my first problem.  I went through the initial set-up and put in my wifi password and it started downloading the update.  It got to within 30mb of being completed and gave me an error.  It started downloading again, got to about the same spot and stopped again.  After the third attempt at downloading I started searching and found that Sony had the file available on the Playstation site so I downloaded it from there, followed their install instructions and it worked.  Too bad I wasted 45 minutes of failed downloads before trying it.

Things went pretty smooth after the install.  I logged in using my Playstation Network ID and it ported over everything related to that.  I messed around with the navigation bar and it felt new, but also familiar.  I certainly didn't feel lost and new exactly what I needed to do.  That's a good sign.  I put in my first game, Assasin's Creed IV, and it immediately started installing the game.  This is where things got interesting.  With the PS4, Sony is requiring the game to be installed to the console.  You can't play it without the disc, but it is basically like an unlock key.  This allows for some pretty neat things that PS3 owners should love.  AC4 came with many codes for costumes and weapons so I started inputting those.  On the PS3, you would have to quit the game and input codes and then go back to the game.  With the PS4, it basically pauses the game, allows you to do whatever you need, then you can just continue.  It is seamless, quick and works like a charm.  I was very impressed.  However, this is also when I ran into my second problem.  Sony's servers were going down, which is why I couldn't download the update, and it was also causing problems connecting to the Playstation Network.  I managed to get a few codes entered, but that was it.  I started getting error after error.  I finally gave up and just started playing the game.  I was never able to access the PSN for the rest of that first night.  Even into Saturday, I continued to see the message that the PSN was down for maintenance.

As far as playing the games, the biggest change I've encountered is with the DUALSHOCK 4.  They keep pretty much everything that we love, but there are some significant changes.  Gone are the select and start buttons.  That may not sound like a big deal, but it gets confusing when playing a game you are familiar with.  My thumbs kept going to a start button that wasn't there to pause the game, or to the missing select button to pull up a map.  Sony has moved those functions to the touchpad located on top of the controller.  Then there are the new ""share"" and ""options"" buttons.  The ""share"" button allows you to take a photo of your screen or a 15 minute video.  You can also broadcast your gameplay.  I've done the photo upload and it worked great, but have yet to try the other share features.  The options button was used various times throughout menus and the game.  It seems to be a catch all type of thing for many different maintenance functions.  You will also notice  a light on the front of the controller that lights up blue by default.  It is supposed to be used with the Playstation 4 camera to track movement, but can also change colors depending on what is happening in the game.  I don't have a Playstation Camera right now so haven't seen how it interacts with that, but I can tell you the light is distracting in the dark.  I could see it reflected in my screen and it was annoying.  The last big change to the controller is battery life.  With the PS3, charging my controller was an afterthought.  The battery would last somewhere around 30 hours.  With the DUALSHOCK 4, it's more like 6 hours.  That is a HUGE change that I bet most people don't know about.  I was shocked to see that I had to charge my controller on Sunday after a weekend of playing for a couple of hours each day.  The good news is that you can charge the controller at night by plugging it into the PS4 while it is powered down, something you couldn't do with the PS3.  Also, the DUALSHOCK 4 uses a micro USB instead of a Mini USB so your DUALSHOCK 3 cables will not work.  I've already found several cheap cables here on Amazon that I am going to try that are 10 feet in length.",4.0
"I originally picked this game up when it first came out.  I remember how many people raved about its originality and its amazing game play.  Compared to other games I've played in that era I definitely have to agree that it was very original.  I must've been about eleven or twelve when it was first released.  I will admit that while playing this game as a kid I couldn't figure anything out and I played it for many hours scratching my head trying to figure it out.  Eventually I got to the point where I gave up and had to use the walkthrough guide.  This game was really quite enthralling with very interesting and complex worlds regardless of my first experience.

I recently replayed the game and even over a decade later I still have the same thoughts.  However, some of the games limitations became much more apparent to me.  Basically you're thrust into a world and have to use the discovery method to figure things out.  You go around click a few switches here, turn a tower there, very elementary and obvious stuff right?  Not really, but I will say that I think I was playing the game at the wrong age.  I think I was a bit too young to see the obviousness of the puzzles.  What took me months to work out at age eleven, took me a few minutes at my current age.  I was seriously able to blow through this game in a few hours and this was actually the first time I've played since the last time that many years ago.  I remember a few of the basic things, but I couldn't remember much of anything about the other worlds you link to.

The general story premise is that you somehow end up on Myst Island, presumably you linked there from some other book on your home plane of existence and you teleported to this one.  Anyway, you find the island uninhabited, but it's obvious that people were once here.  There's a little building with a library in it, but most of the books are burnt.  Clearly something is amiss.  There are two other books on pedestals to the right and left, when you open them you find people trapped inside.  I would later learn these are called prison Ages.  Both prisoners, naturally, want to be released and ask you to help them.  The object of the game is to find all the missing pages of their books so you can release them.  The basic setup of the world is that the books are more than just books; they are gateways to other worlds.  The worlds in the Myst universe are called Ages and you get back to your original location by using a linking book.  It's actually a really creative concept!  The world is vastly different and they actually used live actors for the scenes in the game.  You have to realize that this was practically revolutionary when it was first coming out.  It wasn't the same kind of live actor design Mortal Kombat was using, they were actually having people act in a blue screen environment then transporting them into the Myst world.

Myst was really a ground breaking game when it was first released.  It's partially a puzzle game and part mystery.  The way people could interact with small portions of the environment and see their effects was really interesting as well.  Basically you have to find out why the two brothers are so accusatory of each other and why they were imprisoned.  You find out more as you find more pages on different Ages, which is where the puzzle part comes in.  You get clues on Myst Island in order to find ways to get access to the other ages.  Then once you're on that Age you have to figure out how to get back!

It's actually a really fun game except for the fact that after you solve an island you can only bring a page back with you.  But then you have to do that a second time if you want to bring the other page back.  Now it's not nearly that bad, all your solutions are still done and it's much quicker to run through the age the second time, but it's the fact you HAVE to do it a second time.  For example, if I find the blue page on the other age and then I find the red page, I can't carry them both back with me.  That's kind of annoying that you can't carry two, you really see the games limitation at this point.  So I bring the blue page back and listen to that guys new message, then I have to go back to the Age and get the red page then come back and listen to his message.  You have to do this every time, and that's what lost a star for this game.  It's rather inconvenient.

Overall this is one of the more creative games developed in recent times.  The story line is vibrant and it has a shock ending that you don't really guess until you get there.  There are actually three different possible endings for this, which is pretty cool.  So save your game before you're about to beat it, then you can reload it and watch another separate one!",4.0
"As a huge Jeopardy fan, I was very excited to try out the video game. This title is fun for groups, but the difficulty levels leave a little to be desired. ""Easy"" offers multiple choice answers which makes the game far to simple. ""Medium"" does not offer multiple choice, but as you type in your answer, answers you may be trying to spell pop up which also dumbs it down a bit. Yet ""hard"" mode is fairly difficult. Overall the game is good entertainment, but a little lackluster. Highlights are the minigames and unlockables which add a fun twist. Don't bother trying to play with MiiSpeak, though, as it's a total joke and waste of money.",4.0

"I'll start with the good first: this console is very small, even smaller than the PS4 in a side by side comparison (about 1cm wider from side to side, but about 3.5 inches shorter front to back). It's extremely well built - gone are the creaky lightweight plastics and hollow feel of the original Xbox One, now replaced with thick, durable white plastic and a solid heavy feel for its size. The system looks expensive and high class. The upscaler is also really good - even backwards compatible Xbox 360 games (which run 720p natively) look absolutely great and crisp.

This Xbox requires your TV to be at least 60hz to select it's 4K option (due to some games running at 60 frames per second) and to enjoy HDR your TV will need to have HDR10 built in. So even if you have a 30hz 4K TV with Dolby Vision HDR, you might not be able to benefit at all. Keep this in mind.

We are 3 years into this console generation now, and it seems the PS4 is becoming the system of choice for most. However, I can say owning both that this white Xbox One S is nicer than the PS4 in its current form, both in terms of design, build quality and features (but a new 4K PlayStation is also right around the corner that will compete with this Xbox). If you're in the market for an Xbox, this is the model to get. The older Xbox One designs are cheaper, but you will get what you pay for in this case.",4.0

"Metroid Prime is an excellent game.  Not absolutely perfect, but still excellent.  Even now, more than two years after its initial release, this is still a must-have for the Game Cube.

People keep calling this game an FPS (First Person Shooter), but it really isn't.  This is an adventure platformer in 3-d.  It requires strategy and exploration to complete.  Players will find themselves returning to locations time and time again in order to unlock new secrets and rooms, unlike in a true FPS where levels are never revisited.

The game world is quite seamless.  The environments are rich and detailed, but not overwhelming.  The monsters are, for the most part, native animals that blend in well to their homes.  And the plot is well-paced, never seeming too fast or too slow.

The learning curve is quite steep, because the controller setup is not typical for such first-person-perspective games.  But once the player has become accustomed to the controls, play becomes fluid and intuitive.  The lock-on targeting system works well, and allows for a wide range of movement.  The relative difficulty of dodging and evasive moves is the one potential sticking point.

This game is quite challenging, but generally not overly so.  But it can get quite frustrating if you can't find the one item you need to proceed at any given point.  This happened to me about two hours into the game, and after several more hours of fruitless searching, I was literally snarling at my tv set in anger.  Eventually, I had to go to an on-line walkthrough at gamefaqs.com to find the item I was missing.

One other problem is that there is a bug in the game that sometimes causes it to freeze when you use the very first elevator between the Landing Site and the Chozo Ruins.  You definitely want to save your game before using this elevator.

There is very little to complain about in terms of the graphics.  They are fluid and highly detailed, again without being overwhelming.  At a few places there is a tiny bit of slowdown, and in some of the cut-scenes the character movement seems oddly slow and robotic.  But those occasions are few and far between.  The graphics are brilliant overall.  The little details, in particular, really draw the player in.  For example, as other people have mentioned, if the light flashes in just the right way, for a split-second you will see the reflection of Samus Aran on the inside of the visor.

The music is moody and atmospheric.  It always sets the tone perfectly.  Plus, musical transitions when entering a new area are so smooth that you barely notice the music has changed.  Sound effects, such as terrain noises, monster growls, and the odd language of the Space Pirates, are all quite wonderful at setting the scene.  Samus Aran herself never speaks, but then she has no companions to talk to.  Ultimately, she comes across as exactly what she is: a silent, stoic ass-kicker.

The game has a fair amount of replay value, as well.  There are three separate endings, the only difference between them being how much of the ending is actually revealed.  Which of these three endings you get depends on how many things you scan using the scan visor.  You only get the third, most revealing ending if you scan 100% of the log book entries.  There are also several picture galleries that can be unlocked based, again, on how much of the log book scans you get, as well as how often you beat the game.  Beating the game also unlocks ""hard mode"", as well as a couple extras you can get by linking to the GameBoy Advance game, ""Metroid Fusion"".

So, to sum up, not perfect but still an excellent game.  If you have a Game Cube, get ""Metroid Prime"".  Period.",4.0
"So I think most people will agree with the statement that Fight Night 3 was amazing and Fight Night 4 left a lot to be desired. But just like a good fighter, Fight Night bounces back big with this latest installment.

- Champion Mode: Fight Night Champion mode is a blast. The story sucks you in and doesn't let go. At first I was a little disappointed you couldn't use a created boxer for the ""story"" mode but it the end the story makes up for it.  Instead of just fighting boxer after boxer you have to use strategy to get through the Champ mode. As you progress you get limited by story details. It's a little hard to explain and I don't want to spoil anything but let me tell you breaking your hand and having to fight one handed is a pain in the butt. The last fight is a blast, you can't just walking in and throw bombs you have to listen to your manager and stay alive.

- Legacy Mode: I have to admit I was more than a little worried that legacy mode would suffer due to the awesomeness of Champion mode. I'm glad to report it doesn't, you still create a boxer and work yourself up the rankings but they have added some cool new features that help you forget you are simply fighting match after match. Training is better than ever before with more options and non-interactive options which I found awesome. Once you start becoming popular you can spend time at events to help raise popularity and the trainer will even help schedule matches against high ranking boxers you otherwise would not have access to. It's a big step up from Fight Night 4

- Settings: I believe this is the first time you can do this, if it's not someone correct me but perhaps the best new feature is the ability to set power, speed and accuracy of all boxers in the settings. Another review was complaining that heavy weight fights only last 2 or 3 rounds until a KO. You can FIX THAT and its awesome. Turn down the power meters and your games are going 10 rounds no problems. If you are someone who wants to walk through legacy mode as a one man tank, turn up power, speed, stamina and accuracy meters and you can throw power hooks until the ring is covered in blood. (Not literally)

- Controls: My biggest problem with FN4 was the punch controls themselves FNC goes back to the old school way of throwing with either the stick or buttons. Stick control punches are much more fluid and feel almost natural once you get use to them. Gone is the way of circular motions to throw punches, each direction you flick the stick throws a different punch making combinations easier than ever.

- The Little Things: The Graphics in FNC are top notch. The rings, entrances and boxers all look amazing. The roster is huge and all our favorite boxers from the past half a century all make a return.

- The Little Things I don't care for: For those reading this review later on in the year please take note that this is an EA game therefor if you buy it used you will have to buy an on-line pass. (Money grubbing suits) The other thing I wish was ""different"" is the new corner system. I always liked to idea of fixing my boxer in the corner with an interactive system. That is gone and has been replaced with an automatic system that works based on your last rounds results.

All and all I would call Fight Night Champion a big step up from what Fight Night 4 offered. If you were a fan of the 3rd one you will love this edition. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I have so far.",4.0
"Let's face it, no other category of games has earned more respect and a greater following by hardcore gamers than the shoot-em-up genre. With the lack of vertical and horizontal shooters that are released each year it is a relief that the third Shikigami title finally found its way to console overseas.

In classic arcade-style fashion, the game is played vertically with your goal to literally annihilate everything in sight while dodging enemy fire. I won't go into detail with how the game works because there is a very brief tutorial telling you everything you need to know. No one should have any problem with the controls since anyone can pick this one up and play. You can choose to use the Wii Remote, Classic Controller, or GameCube Controller and all of them are easily interchangeable. The visuals are smooth and colorful with some very neat bullet patterns while the upbeat soundtrack keeps the excitement alive. With different characters and their own storylines and attacks, you will find yourself replaying through the stages more than once.

Although it is a short game, it can still be notoriously tough and intense for some gamers even on normal mode, which especially holds true in the later stages. But whether or not you play it single player or cooperatively with a friend, this game is perfect for those who want to play for around an hour or so, thus making the Wii an excellent choice to port this game to. Shoot-em-up fans and fans of the previous Shikigami games shouldn't be disappointed. With the Wii becoming a dumping ground for more and more shovelware aimed primarily at non-gamers, I feel very fortunate that this game exists even though not many people know about it. It's bullet crazy madness and offers a good challenge. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.",4.0

"TMNT: Mutants in Manhattan has gotten kind of a bum deal when it comes to how it's reviewed in the west. While the lack of couch co-op is a huge  letdown, the rest of the game that's here is far better than you've probably been led to believe.

So, this is Platinumgames doing TMNT, and Mutants in Manhattan is a Platinum title through and through. For the uninitiated, what this means is that we have the flashy, fluid, tight, responsive combat the developer is known for, some gorgeous (if often too samey) cel-shaded visuals, a really quick pace when it comes to that combat and the game's structure, and a fun, deep leveling system when you dig deep enough into it.

Problem being, Mutants in Manhattan, like most character action titles, is a game that demands to be played through more than once. There's a reason the game displays a level chart with your best rankings displayed across all difficulties in between levels and at the end of the game. Your first play through on the lower difficulties should be considered training. You're learning the combos, the timing, the general flow of gameplay, leveling your Ninjutsu powers, etc., until you can tear it up on the higher difficulties. Most games in this genre are purposefully designed this way. You're actively meant to play through this across all difficulty modes to get the most out of it. And when it comes to difficulty, I'm glad to say that TMNT doesn't disappoint when compared to other Platinum titles. Once you start playing on hard and very hard, the game becomes as quick, frantic, and rewarding as any other Platinum title.

Learning how combat works here really helps. You have light and heavy attacks, a block, two different dodges depending on how you time them, and a parry. All of your defensive maneuvers are tied to a meter that when allowed to decrease all the way will leave your character open to attack for a few seconds until it recharges. This encourages picking your defense wisely and not spamming it. Make no mistake, Mutants in Manhattan actually requires skill to truly get good at on its higher difficulty settings, which is the case for most of Platinum's work. Put simply, this is an incredibly designed and fun combat system for a character action games, and Platinum didn't disappoint in this regard.

One of the more interesting aspects of the game lies in its randomness. Levels are designed to be fairly open. You're given goals to accomplish in these levels before you face a boss, like defusing bombs, transporting stolen bags of money to their rightful owners, remaining stealthy, or simply taking out all of the enemies you find. Largely, a lot of this an excuse to get to the combat, which is a good thing. A lot of them act as fun enough distractions in which you have to take on or avoid groups of enemies, and they work well enough. But they are completely randomized. You can play a level multiple times and not really get the same set of goals twice. Most are completed within a few minutes time though, and I never found these goals annoying or pace breaking. There were enough of them that they lent to the game's strong pacing.

The boss fights are where this game really shines. Although all of these bosses fall into the damage sponge category, the way this interacts with your Turtles and their health bars, your ninjutsu loadout, or how prepared you are with secondary items, it all works and makes for compelling boss fights in spite of chipping away at their 7 health bars. Bosses will get progressively tougher as you whittle their health bars down, and it makes for some intense moments if you're utilizing this combat system to the best of your abilities.

Add on top of this some legitimately good writing, incredible animations, fun cutscenes, and you're left with a Turtles game that does the franchise proud. All of this said, it's no surprise to me that this game reviewed as poorly as it did. While the lack of couch co-op certainly hurt its reception, character action games typically don't review well in the west. Take a look back at games like God Hand, or Killer is Dead. Two of the most original and tightly designed games the genre has to offer, and they were virtually panned by critics left and right. I don't think Mutants in Manhattan is any exception to this trend, because the game we have here is sincerely way better than the low scores most publications have been blasting it with.

This begs the question though, is Mutants in Manhattan seriously worth its price tag? That depends. If you plan to only play through it once to see what the story has to offer, then no. But if you plan on going through all of its difficulties, focusing on its leveling system, or if you have friends to play with online, then I'd say the game is worth every penny of the $50 it retails for. It's a matter of knowing what you're getting yourself into, and for fans of the character action genre, they could certainly do a whole lot worse than this. While more visual variety would have been welcome, and while couch co-op definitely would have improved this experience twice over, what we're left with is a fast, stylish, precise action game that absolutely deserves to be played past its lower difficulties. It's a game that demands your attention and skill, and deserves more credit than it's probably ever going to get.",4.0

"My daughter is almost 2. She's obsessed with Dora. She's also obsessed with trying to take my phone, or game system because she wants to play too. I got this game for >$5 for the 2DS and she has wanted to play it every night for the past two months.

Important points:

A complete play through of the game can be completed in less than a 1/2 hour.

4 different save slots...but like I said, 30 minutes or less to completion, so ""losing your save"" is not really relevant to this title.

You can play any of the ""sub games"" by choosing them from the menu without having to have beaten them.

You cannot lose: no deaths, no game overs, some games *seem* to auto complete if you do it wrong long enough...

It follows the same story points as the show of the same name, but does not include any of the songs (which is why we dropped a star from our review. What is Dora without singing?!)

Microphone required...and a bit flaky: Dora's voice comes over the speakers and says ""pick a pile of sand and then blow into the microphone."" I cannot get the microphone to understand that, so we just scratch the DS over the microphone until it accepts that as input. A different game wants you to tell Swiper to swipe...and we don't seem to get a lot of consistency in that one either.

No additional content beyond what is included in the show, and the ability to play them out of order. (no coloring, or other mini games)

So-does you child need this game? Does your child still enjoy reading the same book 10 times in a row? or watching the exact same movie or episode for hours? Or doing the same puzzle over and over? And do they also absolutely adore Dora? Mine does. If yours does too, buy this game.

 For the past week, my daughter has only played the colored garbage matching mini game...over and over...and probably would for hours if I didn't take it away from her. It keeps my daughter distracted and gives me a reprieve until Dora's voice chiming ""try again!"" shatters my sanity and we need to play with something else.",4.0

"This is the first of the DBZ Budokai series and its awesome. Excluding Budokai 2 and 3, this is the best DBZ game period. The story mode recreates the entire animated series up to the Cell Games in 3-D. Besides the story mode, you can play the duel mode which is like the multiplayer mode. You can also play the world tournament mode which pits you against other computer controlled characters in a tournament. If you win, you'll get money which you can use to buy skill capsules at Mr. Popo's skill shop. The next mode is the practice mode where you can practice your character's moves against your opponent. Then comes the edit skills mode, where you can change your character's skill capsules or buy new ones. These skill capsules contain attacks and items your characters can use. You can set up to 7 skills per character in their skill sheet. Set up each character's skills in your favorite way, to create the ultimate custom character. Another mode is the options where you can change difficulty levels, controller settings, and other things like brightness or screen position. The last mode you can have is actually a secret, one you'll have to unlock. All I'm telling you is that you can buy it at Mr. Popo's skill shop after you win first place in the world tournament mode playing at the adept level. Overall, this game is a must-have for any DBZ fans.",4.0

"The mysterious game called Ico never made a splash upon release, nor did it really try to. Just like its quiet and shadowy approach within the game, its marketing was just as ambiguous. While I think this game was definitely underrated by audiences, it was just a TAD overrated by critics. You control a boy born with horns called Ico, who's been banished away to an immense castle as we're told ""for the good of the village."" There you escape and find a white glowing princess, and you must lead her and yourself out of there while trying to avoid the princess being captured by her dark lordess mother and her ghouls, while solving puzzles along the way to get out.

Eyes and Ears: 4/5: On a simply artisitc level, Ico is brilliant and beautiful. It's apparent with both graphics and sound the designers were trying to go for a more artsy approach rather than a straight-out bar-none eye-popping design. The graphics in this game are gorgeous, but not to the casual observer, as most of its inspired level design, attention to detail, and polished glitz are greatly overshadowed by a misty fog, or a layer of light calming ""fuzz."" This effect gives the mysterious world at some mysterious time a sense of surrealistic ambience, almost as if we were dreaming this whole adventurous ordeal.

Sound I can summerize in one word: quiet. The ONLY music that ever plays during the game is when you're loading your game, if you die, and during the ending. The other 95% of the time there is no sound but various doves flying around, footsteps, clanks during battle, the main character's mystery language, and other sound effects. At first I felt the game could've only benefited from some beautiful fantasy type music, but later swallowed my words, as doing so would make this dreamlike experience, well, far less dreamlike.

Hands: 3/5: While everything else in this game was beautiful, I have to give an 'eh' to the controls. See, the camera is self moving, which means you can't control it and you must move the analog stick in the appropriate direction depending on what angle the camera is pointing (always annoying). Also, I've fallen more times than I needed to thanks to Ico's running being too loose to what degree I'm holding the analog stick. On top of that, during battles it's basically mashing the same button towards whatever enemy you're fighting... but keep in mind, battle is simply an icing on the cake in this game (an easy icing), the fundamental thing here is puzzle solving. Decent controls, but would have appreciated a tighter feel.

Brains: 4/5: While many complain that the puzzle aspect in this game isn't anywhere near the challenge they thought it would be, it's for good reason: this isn't Myst. There are no collecting items for later strategic use, or reading riddles and trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle from them, or connecting jigsaw pieces together. The ""puzzle"" aspect in this game are from trying to find a way out of what specific area you're in, and not only that, but trying to get the princess a way out as well (because she's not as nimble as you and can't do as much). Getting from point A to B is the only point. Also, I think the concentration on this is only greater emphasized by the fact that there are no health meters, no power-ups, no hidden treasures, no timers. The only ways to die or lose is if the princess gets captured and pulled into the ghoul's black hole, or if you fall from a far distance. (hint: if you find yourself straying too far away from the princess, you're not doing the puzzle right and she WILL be captured - always keep her as close as possible)

Hormones: 4.5/5: While in the beginning most gamers may find this to be too slow, the more patient and sensitive gamer will fall in love with this one. Though you may think this game has no point, play it long enough (well, not too long, I beat it in 8 hours) and the characters will grow on you, leading to one of the sweetest and most heart-touching endings I've seen in a game in a very long while.

See, the most beautiful thing about this game lies in its mystery. The fact that you don't know what time you're in, or what world (or universe) you're in, or who EXACTLY these characters are, where they came from and where they go afterwards. Nor do you know what language they're speaking in (everything's subtitled). Still, you fall in love with this brave boy and beautiful princess because you become one with their adventure, and you learn more about their character based on this rather than just having 20 pages of backstory written by the game designer.

The purest ones who don't care for meglomania in games will see this one through and appreciate it greatly in the end. There most likely will be no sequal, or prequal, or spin-off. This is just a random but uniquely gorgeous little bird in a huge forest of birds who'll only be noticed and appreciated by a few. And just like a dream, this one comes to an end short, but the ride is great while it lasts.

If you're into castles, heroism, fantasy and lovable characters and need a break from blowing people's heads off (I did for a little bit) pick this one up now. Considering most people have it for less than $20, you've got nothing to lose.",4.0
"Bethesda has set the standard for how action RPG's are made.  This game, however, targets a wider audience than Fallout and Elder Scrolls does.  This game is a mash up on Assassin's Creed, Batman Arkham City and Syndicate.  You get a sword in one hand and the choice between magic, crossbow and pistol in the other hand.

The game takes place in a steampunk version of London-ish.  The plague is a problem but modern technology is there, which is a cool spin to see it done.  You start out as the body guard who gets blamed for a murder/kidnapping (hence the name Dishonored).  From there your character, Corvo, is out to catch those responsible for the murder and strike vengeance on all the evil doers!

It's nice to have a game whose outcomes are choice based.  If you kill more enemies, the guards will be on higher alert and the ending will be darker.  If you take the stealth route, you'll discover more loot, get away with more sneaky stuff and have a more fun time.

Note to people like me aka love killing...save often.  Same as in Fallout for me, I tried out running some guards, went into a building, which enabled auto save, and then died in the building.  When I respawned, my health was low and the guards were there to kill me.  I have to go back 1 hour in gameplay in other saves to avoid it.  So annoying but that's Bethesda.  Other than that, this game is amazing.  Great story, fun action and very tense at times to get away with being stealthy.",4.0

 There aren't THAT many new residential lot objects. It does add some cool carpets... not in build mode, it is the same as the Sims 1, which is really cool! I really wanted the rugs like there were in the Sims 1.

 You do get garages and cars, but I, myself have not figured out how to connect a garage and a garage door. It keeps telling me to put it between the driveway and the extension or something. Oh well, that's why the trusty move_objects on is there to help with any weird problems in buy mode!

"I wasn't a fan of Mass Effect. I know it sounds like a heresy, but I found the overall experience to be a drag. So it wasn't until this past month, when I found Mass Effect 2 on sale, and with more free time than expected, that I decided to give this highly praised game a chance. I'm glad I did.

What Works:

What Bioware does best is attempt to tell compelling stories via a strong focus on the protagonist. When they hit their mark, Bioware creates moments where you actually step back from the options and choices you are asked to make, and take the time to carefully consider the ramifications of your decisions.

Those moments of moral ambiguity create a sense of internal struggle within the player that can transcend the game and leave you questioning your own sense of self not just as a player/character, but as a person. You become immersed and connected with the story at a sincere intellectual and emotional level. It's very effecting when it works, and it works several times during the course of this game.

ME2 unfolds largely as a series of vignettes featuring missions that further expound on the individual story lines of your companions (and some other NPC's). Most of your companions are, throughout the course of the game, revealed to be layered, complex people with various motivations and concerns. How you choose to interact with them, and help them solve their problems, defines your relationship with these characters and what type of person 'your' Shepard is.

The soundtrack has a very moody vibe to it that really sells the games atmosphere.

What's Okay:

Game-play takes a backseat to the story telling in ME2. Fortunately the game-play is largely competent.

I thought the combat mechanics in ME1 were tedious and uninspired. The combat in ME2 is a step up from ME1. It's more visceral, and the maps are more interesting. There is a heavy emphasis on taking cover, which makes ranged attacks (sniper rifles and ranged biotics) far more effective than up close encounters.

Leveling up and gear have both been simplified. None of this detracted from my enjoyment of the game.

What's Disappointing:

If Bioware wants to deal in well fleshed out characters and challenging moral content, then I expect the entirety of the game to match that level of maturity. Unfortunately this is where Bioware came up short.

It's easy to point to the salaciously low-cut v-necks on cartoonishly endowed women. The fact that 'Shepard' can be a male or a female in the game, but all marketing materials point distinctly to a him. Or how the camera swings in for the gratuitous close up bust-line and butt shots on female companions. These overtly sexualized directorial/editorial decisions don't predominate the game, but they do pull me back out of the experience by reminding me just how 'boyish'(immature) the attitudes are at times in relation to the much of the rest of the story content.

It's hard to knock Bioware too hard for this, as this is an industry wide issue, and they are far from the worst offenders. Bioware has done a lot for the credibility and evolution of cRPG's over the years, and it would be great to see them take the genre into the 21st century with regards to gender roles, sexuality, and stereotypes as well.

Conclusion:

Putting aside my grievances, I know that Mass Effect 2 is sure to be a classic cRPG. A unique universe, populated by distinct characters, complemented by a rich story telling experience. This sequel is an improvement over the first in every way that counts, and I'd highly recommend any fan of the genre pick up a copy and play. You won't be disappointed.",4.0

"The successor to the Gamecube's Battalion Wars, BW2 has made advances in many of the fields considered problems in the original game.

The plot follows that of the last game almost exactly - a war between two nations is revealed to be orchestrated by a third nation. This time, the two nations are the Anglo Isles (a strange take on Britain and the game's new faction) and the Solar Empire (a futuristic Asian country), though  the intervening nation remains the German-styled Xylvania. Once again, the nations must band together to stop Xylvania from conquering the world.

The gameplay elements that have been improved are the new country (the Anglo Isles), the inclusion of naval units (frigates, dreadnoughts, and the like) and online multiplayer (versus or co-op). All of these add to a fairly solid game, so if you liked the first one there's no reason not to like this one. A lot of the additions are based on complaints with the first game, so at the very least it's nice to see that Nintendo's paying attention to the general feeling. All the units and countries from the old game have also returned. The strategy and tactics, however, are still basically ""use x unit against y enemy"" and lack the subtlety of Advance Wars.

The Wii remote fits sort of well into the game. Through the use of the nunchuck and the remote, players navigate their soldier around the battlefield, attack, and issue simple orders (usually ""follow me"", ""stay here"", and ""attack that target""). Like Twilight Princess, BW2 uses the Wii remote's speaker for certain sounds, which works to mixed effect.

The graphics are roughly the same as Battalion Wars 1, and have the cutesy style that the games (and the Advance Wars games) are known for. This deteriorates a little bit from the ""war"" thing, but that's their style. The sound still borders on offensive, with really stereotyped characters for each nation (especially the heavily accented Solar Empire commanders). The music is decent, but not exceptional.

As a whole, I don't really like Battalion Wars, but this is a definite improvement from the first. I can at least give them credit for taking suggestions seriously and trying to make the game better.

"So I found this game in the Redbox today and I picked it up because the cover looked awesome and the summary of the game sounded pretty cool!  A cop who was murdered in Salem Massachusetts has to find his own killer even though he's a ghost, sounds fun to me!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The town of Salem Massachusetts has been used many times in fiction because of the witch trials that happened there that sent innocent people to their deaths.  Well here we have a killer who is going around murdering people who would be considered modern day ""witches"" because they can talk to the dead, i.e. they are mediums.

The people of the city and the police are scared and who wouldn't be?  These innocent young women are being brutally murdered on the city streets and in places that most of us would consider to be safe public places.

Our hero is Ronan who was killed and is so determined that he cannot pass on until he finds his killer.  He searches the city with the help of his medium sidekick, Joy, who is looking for her missing mother who is also a medium.  Together they help several lost souls pass on to the afterlife and help them find peace with how they died.

The ending is amazing and you won't see the ending coming at all!  I'm serious, I thought I had the ending called, but I was totally wrong!  If you wanna know who the killer is, you'll just have to play the game!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

The game itself is pretty good at building a creepy atmosphere.  I was tense through the whole game and I will admit I was a little scared that something was going to jump out and scare me at any second.  There were a few times that demons do pop out and they are pretty scary looking, and that scream they do when they appear or when they attack gets me every time!

The control is pretty good and you can easily move around in the game and interact with your environment without any trouble.  You can't pick anything up or move anything so you don't have to worry about an inventory or keeping items memorized that you have.  What would be helpful though, is a map screen!  That would have made things a lot easier!

The graphics in the game are pretty impressive and they do make you feel like you are in a modern city that is being plagued by a serial killer and it's citizens are terrified for their safety.  Also there is just enough of old Salem thrown in to make you realize the game is also taking the witch trials into consideration for it's storyline.

Where the game is disappointing is that the game only takes about 9 hours start to finish.  That's it, 9 hours of game play for 50 bucks.  So you basically get one day of gaming in for your investment.  The only real thing that would make me want to play the game again would be to go back and get all the little items to complete collections in order to get achievements and get the side stories.  Which honestly if I went online and looked up where they all were on a walk through, I could add maybe 20-30 minutes to the game.

So all in all the game is fun, it keeps you glued to your console, and on the edge of your seat.  However the price is unrealistic and the game is too short to make it worth paying 50 bucks for.  I'd say this is definitely a game that you rent, not buy.

"It's time for an honest opinion of the game that X-Box owners tout constantly without pause: Halo.  First things first: There is next to nothing original about this game.  Rather, it seems more an experiment in REFINEMENT.  Everything in this game has a very strong level of balance to it, and it doesn't seem that (besides graphics and in some cases sound) that Bungie took really big risks with this game.  There aren't any bots to speak of, networked play has been around for years either on the PC or Playstation 2, there are few weapons to really speak of, enemy variety is also hurting, and the AI is fantastic but merely represents one of the best around, not a higher echelon in enemy intelligence.  Multiplayer, alas, I haven't been able to play much of, and though it does show a lot of promise, especially with the vehicles and options, is pretty much as extravagant as Perfect Dark, the last game to define this genre and really push boundaries.  People have also said that this takes the narrative of FPS to a new level.  You can't really claim they're the first to go to this depth with the story, however, as both Nintendo and Sierra/Valve have pushed the envelope on FPS stories with their respective Pefect Dark and Half-Life.  Control is near-perfect (save the clunky movement for vehicles), but doesn't make any leaps over other console FPS's (then again, if it ain't broke...).
This brings me to the only two advancements that Halo makes in the way of shooters: Graphics and sound.  These are merely aesthetic details, too, but I will give Halo credit as it is the best looking game I have ever played, bar-none.  While it doesn't have the graphical variety of later Gamecube games like Metroid and Wind Waker, everything has a gritty look to it here, and bump-mapping does make for some great eye-candy.  Physics are terrific, as well, and the shadows cannot be matched by any other game.  Reflections are also superb, and the people in the game are modeled with painstaking detail.  Your jaw will drop at the opening cinema when you see the captain's facialm movements and expressions.  Everything just seems to have its proper place in the game, and that really helps in drawing you into the admittedly well-crafted Starship Troopers-esque storyline.  Sound, alas, is also pretty friggin good.  Ricchochets of bullets and the roars of the Covenant as you bring them down are pleasing to the ear, as well as other ambient effects.  The music, while sparse, becomes heart-poundingly intense at just the right times.  The voice acting throughout is also well-cast.  It does manage to set a bar for shooter audio that will be hard to match.
These things being said, I have no doubt in my mind that Halo isn't one of the greatest games to come out in awhile.  Yet, my friends, it's just ONE GAME, on a system that really doesn't offer much besides that ONE GAME.  Munch's Oddysee is about the only other game that acheives anything noteworthy or memorable (unless you count DOA:EBV's bouncing...uh...volleyball), but beyond that the water's pretty tepid in X-Box country.  I'm guessing that's why this is all X-Box owners have to talk about; it's the only thing that's still keeping them entertained.  Really guys, if you want things to be excited about, get a Gamecube, or at least a PS2.  It's been almost a year and a half now; calm down already.",4.0
"I honestly don't know how many of these LEGO games I have played now. I have played the Star Wars games, the Indiana Jones games, the Batman games, the Harry Potter games, the Pirates of the Caribbean games etc. I lost count somewhere along the way. My latest brush with LEGO videogames takes me back to Jurassic Park. I am definitely a fan of the Jurassic Park films so I was really happy too see LEGO bring Jurassic Park into the LEGO game series and I suspected going in that this would be yet another entertaining LEGO game and that it definitely was.

All 4 games are covered here including the original Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Jurassic Park III, and the recent and successful Jurassic World. At this point, I don't think one needs to explain the game dynamics for LEGO games. I am fairly confident that 99% of gamers at this point have played at least one of LEGO's games up to this point. So people know going in what to expect gameplay wise. Jurassic Park does a great job at keeping the basic game mechanic fun and that of course includes running around as dinosaurs. You can play as 20 different Dino's throughout the game plus design your own. Given that the whole premise behind Jurassic World was basically creating a new dinosaur, not letting people design thier own would have been a big letdown, but thakfully that option is included.

Everything from past LEGO games is here as well. The collecting of characters, red bricks, gold bricks, etc. It defnitely takes some time to get a 100% completion with a LEGO game, but I have always enjoyed the challenge of reaching 100% completion and that definitely remained the case with Jurassic Park. The voice acting is done by the main Hollywod stars so that helps to give it that Jurassic Park feel. There was nothing earth shatteringly new with this game, short of being able to be a dinosaur, but I actually think that is one of the things people like about these games. They have introduced some new game mechanics here and there as the LEGO game series has progressed, but thier never anything that actually takes away from the games main game mechanic, that being smash everything you can while solving puzzles. You would think that mechanic would get boring by now, after so many different game releases, but it hasn't, at least not for me. Why it hasn't gotten boring yet is a good question, but its clearly the fact that the games main game mechanic remains entertaininig that has made this series so successful. If people had gottten bored with it, they wouldn't be continuing to churn these games out as they do and even if they did, people would stop buying them and that definitely hasn't been the case, on either front. Is it people's enjoyment of the movies? Is it the simple but entertaining game premise? Personally, I think its a liitle bit of both and that is why Jurassic Park was yet another very successful and entertaining LEGO game.

Bottom line - If you are getting bored of the main LEGO game mechanic then you should steer clear of this release as again, there is nothing earth shatteringly new here that redefines the LEGO games. If your like me and are still finding enjoymeny from the basic mechanic behind the LEGO games and you enjoyed any of the Jurassic Park films then this should be another no brainer LEGO game purchase. It was for me and I came out the other end thoroughly enjoying my time in the LEGOfied Jurassic Park.

"I purchased this recently, even after reading all the negative reviews.  Since I have been bringing my PSP Go each day to work, I wanted protection... and until the cheap Chinese knock-offs come out this was the way to go.  I will lay out the pros and cons as usual first:

PROS:
-Encompasses the PSP Go perfectly and snug
-Build quality is nice even with faux leather
-Ability to play while having the case on
-Looks and feels like an expensive PDA holster/glasses case
-Ability to charge device without removing the case (Note: I do not have the charge base yet to test if it works with this on... if anyone knows let me know!)
-Usable as a stand to sit the PSP Go upright for use with my PS3 controller

CONS:
-Case does make it hard to hit the volume buttons with the screen open
-Velcro, although just a thumbnail size is a bit tacky... wish it was a magnet instead

Some neutral points are that it was a bit tight getting the PSP Go in the first time, but no big deal.  Also the sliding screen takes like 15% more effort to slide up which is also no big deal in my books.  To conclude... this product is just what it is advertised to do, protect!  I feel that especially at $12.99(which is what this is going for @ amazon today 10/9/09) this is a great deal to add some protection to your product.",4.0

If you like BF1942, you will also like this game and vice versa. However there are some differences good and bad. Unfortunately, there are no longer any dedicated servers still up, so I was unable to play multiplayer. Seems like the Star Wars Battlefront (SWB) servers went down in November 2012  based on IGN forum. Hopefully the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Battlefront-II/dp/B000AAL4HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>&nbsp;servers are still active. Unless you are single player fan, I would pass on this.

So what makes the SWB and the Battlefield series so special. They both have lots of features that the other FPS don't have. They both allow you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. In SWB, You can jump into AT-ST, AT-AT, X-wings, Tie fighters, speeder bikes, just to name a few. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in these games is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, and special troops (wookies, dark troopers, etc). In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger. SWB also has a pilot type which repairs vehicles over time while you pilot them instead of the engineer type in BF1942. However, in SWB you are unable to switch types during combat like you can in BF1942. I guess it would not have made sense  that you could go from a rebel soldier to a wookie. I don't know, I think they should at least allow you to take their weapons. Instead when a unit goes down now a package of ammo or health is dropped that you can pick up. This might be more useful, but I liked BF1942 system better. I would note that you can't play as Jedi Knights in this game; however, sometimes they will fight for you or against you. While this seems cool, it does unbalance gameplay.

The graphics in SWB are decent, on par with BF1942 and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Republic-Commando/dp/B000VV9T7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Republic Commando</a>&nbsp;(SWRC). The forest of Endor had foliage similar to Battlefield Vietnam, but SWB had the Ewok tree platforms.  The weapons mostly seemed to be the same from army to army. However there were special units like the Droideka (Destroyer Droid) and Dark Troopers (have jet pack) that changes it up. I found flying in SWB immensely easier than BF1942. I didn't even bother with flying in BF1942, but in SWB jumped in the X-wing and Tie fighter mostly as close air support. The maps are small for aerial units so you'll find yourself doing lots of turns to stay in bounds.

I felt the single player experience on SWB was better than BF1942. While the individual mission still are simply capture the base missions they don't have a storyline, there was actually effort put into making single player more interesting. SWB has two types of single player campaigns. The first type allows you to play through the Clone Wars (episodes 1-3) or the Galactic Civil War (episodes 4-6). These campaigns do not allow you to play both sides in each mission, however, they mix it up so you get to play some missions with each side. Basically you get to lead the forces that were victorious in the movies (no changing history here). There are some cut scenes from the movies between missions that put you in the mood to take on the enemy. In the Clone Wars (7 total missions), the first mission allows you to take it to the Gungans with the Trade Federation Droid Army. I'm not sure why it feels good to drop those long eared goofs, but it does. You then get to beat up the Naboo forces at Theed.  What I found interesting is that they developed the Gungan and Naboo forces just so you could fight them in the single player campaign. In later missions, you get to fight as the Republic Clone troopers. The Galactic Civil War Campaign (9 total missions) is a little more straight forward. At first you get to play as the Empire using your stormtrooper to eradicate the Rebel forces. But as fortunes swing, you then play as the Rebels, pushing back the Empire with the final victory at Endor. I'm sure it is debatable, but I thought the AI was better on SWB. Taking bases was a hard fight. You couldn't just sneak out capture a base. Also the friendly AI would not just leave bases undefended.

The other single player type is Galactic Conquest where you go head to head with an opposing force in order to take over the galaxy. Basically you fight over control of planets and the planets provide special bonus during battles. The winner of each battle gets to decide which planet to attack. In this way, you can play most of the missions from either side with various armies. I liked the campaigns better because in Galactic Conquest you tend to play several of the battles over and over again. But it is still nice to try some missions from the other side.",4.0

"Full disclosure, I own both systems this generation (and last).  I don't have a dog in this race so to speak, so I am coming from the point of view of someone who plays both systems for the games.  I won't bore you with tech specs and such, I am assuming that if you are reading this that you have done some research and are about to click 'Buy it now.'  So, use this review to check out a few things you might not have read about it.  Just some quirks and tips.

First thing I will say is that this is a very nice looking machine.  The Destiny tattoo on the face of it looks cool. It has an attractive white shell and looks pretty darn sleek. It is also quite small and lite weight in comparison to its Microsoft counter part. It has two USB 3 ports in the front (handy for charging the controller).  There is a port in the back for the Playstation Camera (sold separately), so don't confuse it as a USB port. I won't say I didn't spend 20 minutes trying to plug my USB controller wire into the camera port, but uh... yeah... nothing to see here... move along... Unlike the first generation PS3s there is no hard power switch on the back of the machine.  You power down or go to stand by via the PS4 interface.  Also, the stand pictured on the box that the PS4 is standing in is NOT included in this bundle.

It comes with a physical copy of Destiny the Taken King (more or less just a copy of Destiny, and a token for all the download content for the Taken King and all of Destiny's expansions).  Side note, unlike the Xbox One, you have to download the entire game to the PS4 before you can start playing (not a big deal but certainly is unexpected if you are used to the Xbox One where it only needs to install 10% of the game before you can start playing).  So, that was a change for me that I wasn't expecting.  Another side note, the system is SLOW at installing if you leave it all powered up.  Switch it to 'stand by' mode and the install will go by MUCH faster, you will be done in about 20 minutes instead of the projected hours it gives you. Stand By is your friend, go have a coke and check your email, your game will be done installing in no time via stand by.

Also included is a one month subscription to Playstation Plus which is the Sony version of Xbox Live.  You will need it if you are intent to do any online gaming (which is 100% necessary for the game that comes with this system).  It does cost around around 50 dollars for a yearly subscription and it has a few perks that you really shouldn't have to pay for.  The ability to download games and auto update while in stand by seems linked to having Sony's subscription service which is just kind of insane.  The system should be allowed to do that no matter what, so color me unimpressed.  Included as well is a 20% discount on your first purchase from the Sony Playstation Store.  So, that is quite nice.

The interface hasn't changed all that much from the PS3 with some updates here and there.  Still the same slick interface that we all are used to.  The system is very quiet and doesn't get too hot either (which is different from earlier models I have been told). There is a media player included as well (however no DTS support for MKVs which is also the case on the other system).  All the Apps you are used to are present as well.  Vudu, Netflix, ect.  All here.  It does have an internet browser with flash installed (something the Xbox One does not have).

The only issue I have with this system is what you need to do to upgrade the hard drive. This is kind of a pet pev of mine.  You have to open it up, remove the old HD and put in a new one.  In a world where you can get USB external hard drives that you can plug in play into a USB port, why in the name of god and all things holy do I need to crack this thing open to upgrade my memory?  This is a fail to me, as this system does everything else so effortlessly but allow you to add more memory.  In this day and age you shouldn't be asking your customers to open your machine to upgrade your hard drive.  C'mon man... Also, if you ever intend to sell your PS4 (say like, when the PS5 comes out) hold onto this machine's old HD, some stores won't take trade ins with upgraded HDs for reasons that escape me.

But that gripe about the HD install side, this is a good system.  I am happy to have it.  If you are on the fence, there are cheaper models of this system without the sexy Destiny tat.  But thus far I am quite satisfied.",4.0

"Given how totally awesome Rise of a Ninja was, I was eagerly anticipating this game. There are some changes in this here sequel tho'...and I gotta say, not all of them are good. However like it's predecessor, for Naruto fans it's still a big slice of ninja heaven.

Honestly this one is not as well thought out as the last one was. While Rise of Ninja was literally the ""Best Way to Make a Game Out of the First 80 episodes of Naruto""... there are some things about Broken Bond that I could have lived without. This still falls into the category of a ""Must Own for Any Self-Respecting Naruto Fan,"" but it's not as flawless as the pervious offering.

But there is some new stuff that's good. For instance you are given the opportunity of using more characters for the main quest instead of just Naruto. Which makes sense given the story, and makes things more interesting in both the quest and fighting gameplay. The fighting controls also seem to feel a bit less stiff. Also, they straight up give you the option of playing the game with the Japanese voice cast, which apparently for some people higher up on the Otaku Nerd food chain than myself is an absolute necessity. The basic mechanics of utilizing Jutsu to progress through the game, etc are still the same (which is good).

My main beef with this game is this:

In Rise of a Ninja each mission was different and was planned to help advance the story. With Broken Bond each mission is just a fetch quest with some fighting. And it's crazy repetitive. And after a while it gets kind of annoying. Like to the point where the word ""insipid"" isn't too far off. The context of earning the respect of the Hidden Leaf villagers helped to answer the question of ""Why Am I Doing This Again?"" in Rise of a Ninja. You're going to be asking yourself that question a lot more in Broken Bond...and most of the time your just not going to get an answer.

Additionally, they broke from using the actual series animation in some of the cut scenes. Some folks might like that better. I didn't. While the graphics engine makes for a great visual representation of the series animation - I wasn't feeling it cut scene wise. That's just me.

That aside, this is still a great game. All of the goodness from the 60 or so episodes from the second part of the series is in there. The epic battles are still awesome, graphics are still great, and when the game isn't making you backtrack for some inane fetch quest - it's fun-as-all-git-out.

While I recommended buying an Xbox 360 just to play Rise of the Ninja, or playing it even if you aren't a Naruto fan - I wouldn't make the same suggestions with this game. If you own an Xbox 360 and are a Naruto fan, then yes, you should totally own this.

All and all this is still a great Naruto game.",4.0

"prince of persia is one great game to add to any xbox collection. it has some some really fantastic graphics, some of the best ive ever seen for a console game. the gameplay is great but also at times very frustrating, let me explain this all.

the graphics, like i said, are outstanding. not only is this game gorgeous to look at, but the graphics really expand on the overall atmosphere and mood of the game. the sound is superb, but sometimes its kind of misleading, for example, a huge bridge could collapse from right under your feet, but it sounds like your dropping a pebble on concrete.

the gameplay itself is pretty intense, the puzzles can be really mindboggling, you spend a lot of time figuring some out. the traps can also cause confusion, as you have to stop and plan how you're going to get around them. the worst, and i don't put this lightly, WORST part of this game is the horrendous fighting. sure, the acrobatics are amazing, and you can pull of some really awesome moves against enemies, but most of the time your spent running around frantically trying to stay away from enemies, who most of the time are surrrounding you. you won't get any breathers, so if you're low on health and go for a drink of water, too bad, ALL the enemies can transport and smack you into next week while you're taking a drink. to add on to that frustration, the ONLY way you can kill them is if you stab them with a dagger while they're on the ground or slice em up while they're frozen in midair. thankfully, this terrible fighting system was dramatically changed in warrior within.

another thing i noticed is that the game isn't very long, i beat it in about 6 hours. however, the replay value is incredible because you can unlock the very first prince of persia games, which is very cool.

overall, sands of time is a fantastic, and while i may not consider it to be one of my favorites or a game of the year, it certainly stands out from many xbox titles, get sands of time and warrior within, i promise you will not be disappointed.",4.0

"With a long list a horrible First Person Action games including the never to be released Dikatana, the sad Kingpin, and the horrific Blood II, it's a pleasure to see a really find, hardcore, and all together viciously  wonderful first person shootem up game come across my computer screen.
  Soldier of Fortune, which uses a totally revamped version of the Quake II  engine and which is co-produced and released by Activision and Raven  Software, is not mearly a combination of previous action games.  It in fact  takes the game type to a whole new level by adding in some serious real  world guns and putting you in real terrorist situations.  Although you have  to handle them with very rambo-like tactics, the action is fast paced and  the cutscenes weave in nicely with the shooting down of the bad guys.  However, is it too much to ask to have their lips move when they  talk?
The skizy: you are a member of the Army Special Forces, sent in to  stop a terrorist who has stolen nuclear weapons and who plans to use them  in a few special locations.  However, the bad dude who leads the terrorists  doesn't plan to be taken down easily.  So your job is to follow him and  take him down along with his compatriots and recover the nukes.
  Although the story runs a tad thin in some places, the graphics are  stellar.  When you shoot someone in the arm, you really hit their arm, and  laugh at them as gibblets (individual body parts) fly all over.  What also  makes this game great is that the AI, which is usually what makes or breaks  a game like this, is beautiful.  When you're shooting a guy and aiming for  his upper body, he will duck or hide near the adjacent wall, only to peer  out and take a couple of quick shots.
The downsides: some missions can  get real tough real fast, and with a multitude of badies who all have itchy  trigger fingers, one level can go from being a half-life like map with few  enemies to a UT type map with a deathmatch like feel to it.  However, you  got the guns, use'em.
Hardware: Plain an simple, you must have an  accelerator card to play this game.  The graphics do not look nearly as  good with only software rendering.  Besides you get to see more of the  blood that way.  Also the higher resolutions can quickly chew on the memory  card so it's best to have a computer with a fast cpu.  IF you have a  computer lower than 300 Mhz, don't expect the card to make up the  difference.  The sound in this game is very good.  Each gun has it's own  firing sound which seperates it from its bretheren and the music, that  rockish techno beat stuff can really get your heart pumping.  But it get's  even crazier when you turn it off.  Recommend that you have a good sound  card if you want to hear all the bells and whistles.
What else is there  to say: If you don't like blood, DON'T GET THIS GAME, it's right up there  with Kingpin level on the gore factor.  Also, don't expect much replay  value, like most regular shootem up's (not including Half-Life) once it's  beat, it's shelfed.
The Highs: Great graphics, AI system is strong, very  detailed locals, and the wonderful sniper rifle...ooo!
The Lows: They  don't move their mouths, low replay value, didn't get much from  Multiplayer, No action plot will ever beat that of Half-Life.
What does  it all mean: If you have all the rambo movies, love continuous action, are  a gun freak, and just love action games, there is none better.  If you're  looking for replay and multiplayer value, stick to Half-Life and Unreal  Tournament.

"I got this game a few days after it came out, and I'm still playing it.  I think that says something about a game.  When I bought Left 4 Dead I played it non-stop, and that game is really great.  I see some negative reviews and I'm not sure why.  I was excited about the game just as many people were, and when I got it and played it, it was everything I thought it would be, well, everything but one: The graphics are not as good as I thought it would be.  I play Fall Out 3 and the graphics for that game is superb.  If you get up close to the civilians walking in the street they look like dolls or something.  I'm not sure why they didn't try to make the graphics even better.  Also the sounds is a bit soft, but all you need to do is turn the volume up for the game, and turn it back down when you're out.

Now the game itself is really fun.  They advertised the game to be one of total destruction and a power trip for the player, and that is correct.  You got different powers, different moves which you can upgrade, vehicles to take over, devastating attacks and lots, lots more.  I was surprised at how many different things you can do.  yeah the area is not as big as GTA, but still it's big enough to have lots of fun and destruction.

The storyline for the game is pretty long, which is good.  I was afraid I would beat the game in a week or so, but it seems like I'm only half way through (I've spent 30+ hours on it).  You can get side tracked from your objective and just do fun things like push civilians and military around, destroy or infiltrate bases, and finish a side mission to gain additional ""experience"" points to upgrade yourself.

Another great part of the game is that it DOES NOT COME WITH DRM or SecuROM.  If that is the only thing that might hold you back from getting it, well, you should get it now.  I will leave my review here.",4.0

"Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2013

It's a good keyboard don't get me wrong but it is my first mechanical. Take note that I'm a ""hardcore?"" gamer yet I find all it's added functions to be almost gimmicky because I myself will barely use them and they are possible with normal keyboards, just takes more ""work?"".

Pros:
- Easy too see at night due to lighting up
- Nice response time
- Macroing is super easy due to the on the fly recording
- Being mate makes it not show finger prints

Cons:
- Heavy
- LOUD (can u hear me? lol)If you learned you not ""bottom out"" as they call it, then you'd have a lot quieter keyboard
- Only color is green (doesn't match my molten mouse)
- USB/Headset jacks are on the RIGHT side so it'll be in the way (right handed)

"God of War 2 is a very, very good game. It is almost as good as the original. But there are some glaring issues that prevent it from being better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War/dp/B0002XL3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War</a>.
As you know this game is epic. Epic with a capital ""E"". The problem is this: you go from running around on mile high ""steeds of time"" to a swamp. Not an epic swamp, just a swamp. From plummeting through the air wrestling Icarus to running through a cave (note: Typhon's cave is an epic cave, but I'm referring to the boring later paths). Epic is good, but it is not consistent. The bland stuff is jarring and stands out from the rest of the game.
The game's puzzles are bad. Not bad difficult - bad totally unnecessary. Most are easy, for example get a block to put on a lever. The problem is that you go from a fast paced battle with a dozen monsters to a move the block puzzle. It totally breaks the flow of the game. Also the puzzles in this game are far greater in number and worse in content than the first game.
The new weapons are unimpressive. ""Athena's"" blades are great, but they do seem a bit similar to the blades of Chaos. I love rage of the titans but quite similar to rage of the gods. Euryale's head is fun, but, hmmm... a head that turns things to stone? C'mon. Just call them Chaos, the god's, and Medusa's respectively and stop pretending that they are even remotely new. The barbarian hammer is cool, but the other weapons are really not useful.
Also much of the story is good, but there are some big plot holes. One that was especially confusing is someone does something dramatic to you in the beginning, you do the same to Zeus (several times), and once to someone else with vastly different results each time.

Now this is a positive review, but just to boil down the only real negative: When the game goes it is great, but stopping points like puzzles detract from the game. The great visuals should have been consistent and the old weapons could have been left intact, but those are minor issues.

Having said that, this is still a game that you need to play. Those issues are minor compared to the positives. Also most of the game's combat hasn't really changed from the first game, so it still has the great combos with gruesome finishing moves.
There are many great things about this game and some are so perfect that I need to mention them. First when you start the game you would select new game and the difficulty and seamlessly go from the title screen to the first cut scene. NO LOADING! If you have seen that title screen you may recognize it as the ending scene from GOW. In other words continuing from the first game the story does not miss a step. In fact all of the cut scenes are of an extremely high quality and for the most part are long on story, but relatively short in length. Also I must give respect to the voice talent. Linda Hunt's voice is back to narrate and is everywhere in the game. Michael Clark Duncan was memorable as Atlas and Harry Hamlin as Perseus was inspired casting.
There were a number of situations that were supported by the epic nature of the game. For example early in the game you can see those ""Steeds of Time"" from a huge distance. Those horses are your destination and when you finally reach them you can't help feeling tiny against these huge creatures. Or near the end when Clotho trash talks you from a huge distance, then later you run right around her quite hefty build. It puts a dramatic perspective for your travels.

I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War/dp/B0002XL3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War</a>., but ultimately if I had to choose one over the other the first one was a bit better. You should absolutely play this game, but play the first one before 2.",4.0

"While not too often ""scary"", Dead Space has slick and responsive controls that put other games in its genre to shame. A shooter at its core, Dead Space tells a simple story in a surprisingly believeable world.
 A creepy new religion based on worshipping alien artifacts controls two of the biggest corporations on Earth and silent engineer, Issac Clark (the player character) is left to pick up the pieces when a ship that's picked up one of these artifacts goes dark.
Most of the monsters (necromorphs) play fair and you never really feel cheated when you die.
The game makes good use of its setting with certain rooms on the ship devoid of oxgyen or gravity. These areas of the game are the most fun. Shooting monsters while moon jumping and watching nervously as your oxygen counter ticks down is intense and exciting.
Unless you're easily grossed out, or frightened, I reccomend this game to anyone who likes action/adventure or shooters.

Also, this is not a game for kids. You should probably be at least 14-15 to play, as the game can get pretty graphic at times and the language isn't kid-friendly.",4.0
"Next generation in the Big Kahuna series. The only problem I really have with the game is at times it seems ""too busy"" but it does offer more obstacles than the Big Kahuna or Big Kahuna Chain Reaction.

In short it depends on what you like...I kind of prefer Big Kahuna over both chain reation or BK3 but it is a good addition to your computer games, and I enjoy it and think most others will as well.",4.0

"Alpha Protocol for the PC

I purchased Alpha Protocol for the PC only because it was less expensive than Xbox 360, however I later found out that it is very easy to earn a bunch of achievements in 1 playthrough, so in retrospect I should have purchased Alpha Protocol for my Xbox. Nonetheless, I found the game to be enjoyable. It is a 3rd person shooter/RPG similar to Mass Effect. There are mini-games to crack safes, hack computers, and bypass doors.

The inventory system is very easy to use, although it suffers many of the same problems as Mass Effect 1 where there are a bunch of different weapons in each family and you don't really know if they're good or not without quickly glancing at the specs. Many of these weapons are given fake names to avoid licensing issues with the real manufacturers. I saw the Remington/Bushmaster ACR, AK, FN SCAR among the assault rifles, and a few pistols. The weapon mods are plentiful and you can apply 4 different categories of mods.

The same goes for the battle armor, and you can carry up to 8 different gadgets depending on the capacity of the armor.

There are quite a few bugs and quirks in the PC game. When switching weapons, the zoom doesn't always work the first time so you have to push it repeatedly to get it to work. I chose to use my Xbox 360 controller to play the game on the PC, so it made the game easier to control except for aiming. The grenades aren't always tossed according to the dotted line, sometimes it hits invisible barriers and bounces back. This reminded me of Gears of War 2, except GoW had a better cover system.

The bypass, lock pick, and hacking mini-games got tiresome the first 300 times I had to use them. I later learned that having EMP grenades allows you to bypass the games but you can carry a finite number of EMP grenades on you at one time. The checkpoint saving is also very frustrating. To sum up this game, it is like a mix of Mass Effect and Gears of War.

Overall: 4/5 stars, very fun, short singleplayer playthrough, 4 romance options in 1 playthrough",4.0
"This James Bond game is cool but they could of made it way better than it was.  I have this game already and I do have fun with it but I say things like they should of done this and this da da da.  In this game they shouldn't of made James Bond look different because then its not realy James Bond. Theres not many levels in the game but some are fun like the driving levels.  Those levels were a great idea.  They should of had more levels like maybe 25 and ten of the levels should be car levels.  That would be awesome.  It would of been cool if you could do car races and car battles in multiplayer.  In multiplayer some of the games that they have you cant do with bots like capture the flag or goldengun that was a mistake.  There are only 12 missions.  The levels should have been longer because some are to dang short.  The missions in the levels are easy to figure out you don't even have to look at what your missions are.  They needed more cheats like the ones from Goldeneye.  Once you earn a cheat you cant turn it of or on it just stays on.  The graphics are great like maybe a 9 because some things are polygon shaped.  You hear the original song in almost every level which is pretty cool.  In order to earn some cheats you have to score points and get these 007 icons.  That was a good idea. This game was just to short plus the ending was cool but it shouldn't have ended the way it ended.  James Bond jumps out of a window and his girlfriend Zoe who was pretty hot catches Bond in a plane.  Then they fly away and its the end.  On Nintendo.com I saw that there would be another Bond game called Nightfire.  I hope this one will be better then agent under fire.  They better have lots of stuff in that game.  Like more levels, more level missions, The real James Bond who is Pierce Brosnan, more multiplayer modes.  Well anyways I hope Nightfire is better.",4.0

"Bought this for my 6 year old, she didn't like it at first she though the squid was scary but after beating it a few times she totally got hooked on Starfy. Still a good purchase for the little ones",4.0
"My two grade-schoolers have been enjoying Skylanders Spyro's Adventure for several months. It's still one of their favorite Wii games, along with Animal Crossing.

We had no problem getting the ""Portal of Power"" platform synced and running. It works well - when the batteries are fully charged. However, once the batteries start to run down, the game freezes and you have to unplug the Wii and reboot. Battery life is rather unpredictable; once, the batteries died after only about an hour of gameplay. Unlike the Wiimotes, which are very easy for kids of any age to replace the batteries of, the Portal has a screw-on battery door, so expect a ""Mom!"" distress call. (I just left the battery door off; the spring-loaded batteries still stay put.)

Extra figurines are still hard to find in stores and pricy at $20+ each online, but at least the three figurines included with the starter set are all you need to play the game.",4.0

"You've got to hand it to the Wild Arms series.  They definitely do things differently than several RPGs.  If you're looking for an RPG that's just all around different then Wild Arms 5 is actually a treat.  It doesn't reach as high as it could, though, but at least it does reach higher than most RPGs would dare to reach, and does a lot of things quite differently and out of tradition for RPGs.

Wild Arms 5 has a fairly simple story.  Dean is a guy who loves exploring ruins.  He's a Golem-Hunter, but he's tired of being cooped up in his town.  When adventuring with his friend Rebecca, an arm suddenly falls from the sky.  Clasped inside the arm is a girl named Avril.  She only mentions something from the past but Dean has no clue what it means. Despite that he decides to investigate anyway.  And in true RPG fashion, no one stops him.  It's a simple story, but it has its own charm.

There's not a lot of character development going on in the storyline, though.  For the most part, you like the characters, but you really wish you could learn more about them.  This has usually been the case with all the Wild Arms games.  It's no different here.  Most of the dialog is good at least.  However, despite the games well written dialog, its attempt at humor don't always succeed, and in some spots it hurts the dialog.  In spite of all that, the game is fun.

Part of what makes Wild Arms 5 interesting is that it really does do a whole lot of things different from your traditional RPG.  You've got your traditional things like battling, dungeons to explore and a myriad of sidequests to go about.  But a lot of this stuff isn't presented to you in a traditional way.  You'll go exploring through dungeons, but Wild Arms 5 throws tons and tons of puzzles your way, and a lot of them are actually complex and well done.  Some are so mind numbing that you'll actually need a strategy guide for them.  Another thing WIld Arms 5 manages to throw in is that the game will always inform you of what room your in as well as always letting you know when you've been through a door in a dungeon and whatnot.  Throughout the dungeons you'll also get hints as to what to do next.  In terms of dungeon crawling, Wild Arms 5 is all around different.  The only games similar to it are other Wild Arms games.

There's also a platforming element going on.  To get through some dungeons you'll have to jump and crouch.  Not only that, but in each dungeon there are Sol Nigers.  When you destroy these things, you're given the chance to completely turn off the random battles within the dungeon.  A nice feature that can go a long way.

It's neat to have all these things within Wild Arms 5, but a lot of it makes dungeon crawling a cakewalk.  Getting hints, always knowing where to go without having to explore for yourself.  At times, it can feel like your hand is being held.

The HEX Battle system from Wild Arms 4 returns here.  Much like Wild Arms 4 there's a deep strategic feel going on here.  You'll move characters around to let them attack the enemy, and your enemy also moves around a lot.  There are seven hexes in each battle, arranged randomly.  The beauty of this battle system is how you can manipulate it and change things up.  For example, you can cast a status effect on a HEX and any time someone (friend or foe) moves to that HEX they are affected with the status effect in question.  Likewise, if they move off that HEX they're no longer afflicted.  You can use this to your advantage, but so can your enemy.  More than one person can stand on a HEX as well, and how far or close you are to an enemy does matter.

There are also Ley points.  These are the elemental factors at work, that help to alter the weaknesses and strengths of those who stand in these hexes.  For example if someone stands in a blue ley point they will take less damage from water based attacks, deal more damage with water based attacks, but at the same time they'll take more damage from fire based attacks, which is the weakness.  It's a great battle system to mess around with.  The only real problem with Wild Arms 5 is that it's disturbingly easy to take advantage of the system.  The game is all around easy.  Your enemies often don't take advantage of the hexes the way you will.  Also, you're healed after battle.  There's almost no challenge present.  Some battles are also just slow going.

As with any RPG, character customization is key and Wild Arms 5 has mediums at work.  Mediums allow your characters to perform more actions in combat or give them bonuses.  Mediums will give you magic and skills.  Like the ability to steal from your enemies or to cast spells.  Some even give you the ability to change Ley points on the Hex.  There's a lot to it, yet it's pretty simple to learn on the whole.

In terms of visuals, Wild Arms 5 isn't a bad looking game, but it's really not good looking either.  It's colorful and there is some neat attention given to certain points, but for the most part, it's bland looking. The artwork is something to appreciate, though.  The game runs pretty smoothly as well.  The game also has some great music to help move things along.

Wild Arms 5 is definitely different.  There are plenty of elements done here to make the game stand out.  This is not your typical RPG by any means. These elements actually make Wild Arms 5 a treat.  The story isn't anything special, but it's not bad either.  If anything, the biggest hit against Wild Arms 5 is that it isn't difficult at all and it holds your hand a lot.

Pros:

+A well crafted battle system
+Dungeon designs are well done, full of fun puzzles to solve
+The ability to turn off random encounters (upon meeting certain conditions) is cool
+Tons of sidequests and optional bosses
+Great soundtrack

Cons:

-Despite the likeable characters, there's not much development
-The game is way too easy
-A few pitiful attempts at humor
-It can feel like the game is holding your hand at times",4.0
