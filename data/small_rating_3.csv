"As my title states, Legend of Dragoon can only be described as ""muddled"".  This game has several failings that cannot be ignored, but if you give it a chance, you may still garner some enjoyment out of this average RPG.  On to the review!

Graphics (8/10): Not the greatest, but not too irritating.  This, of course, is a matter of opinion, but the graphics did not seem too bothersome at all.

Music (6/10): Well, the music ranges from not so good to decent.  There's really nothing about the music that would make me want to buy the soundtrack.  The songs are all rather bland and unmemorable, while not being terrible enough to make your ears bleed or anything.  The voice-acting, which is limited, is kind of laughable.  Overall, the bland music and not-so-good voice acting brings down the score in this section.

Characters (5/10): The characters really aren't well-developed.  They either have stereotypical personalities or are just plain uninteresting.  Sometimes their actions were not convincing at all.  For example, one person is traveling with the party to find his daughter who ran away.  He then goes on and on about not knowing why she left when you clearly find out in a flashback that he criticized her and slapped her for something she wasn't really at fault for.  Hmmm...I wonder why she ran away?  And then, after hearing this story, the rest of the party sides with him and does not point out the obvious reason she ran away.  Another example of awkward character development is the romance between Dart and Shana. Yes, she's naive and soft-spoken and he's the big hero and they fall in love.  Yes, we've all seen this before.  That's not even my complaint.  The romance between them was badly handled by the game developers.  It seems as though Shana is the only one in love with Dart; he sees her more as a little sister.  This creates some awkward moments between them.  I think the main romantic scene of the game is very awkward.  Instead of Dart and Shana voluntarily getting together, the rest of the party members sort of connive to force them together at a party.  Then, out on a balcony, every time the scene between them becomes serious and they are about to kiss, some random NPC shows up and ruins the moment.  I find this odd attempt at humor to be ill-placed and intrusive.  I never really got the impression that Dart and Shana loved each other, instead I felt that the rest of the party loved the idea of getting them together.  Rose is the only character who seems interesting and has some back story. Overall, the game is riddled with character interactions like those above, this really makes it difficult to care about these characters (other than Rose!).

Story (5/10): Once again, ""stereotypical"" is the word of the day.  Guess who's father may be a villian?  No really, guess!  Seriously, the rest of the story feels like one disjointed event after another.  I never felt a sense of continuity with the story, and the final villian seems to come from nowhere.  I never saw it coming, IN A BAD WAY! I mean, the game really could have used some foreshadowing or building up for the final villian.  All that aside, the game's story does have some high points, the ""mythological"" feel of the game is interesting, and although I can't remember for the life of me what all actually happened during the story, I had fun while playing through it.

Battle System (7/10): Well, it's turn based. Not much to say there.  My only real complaint was with the Additions.  While I mostly liked the originality of this element, it was somewhat irritating at times.  The goal is to hit the X button at just the right time to execute your attack.  If you miss even one in the string, your attack does pitiful damage.  As it can be quite difficult to get all of them in a longer string, I was often forced to use weaker Additions instead of the stronger, (and longer) ones.  Aside from that aspect, the Dragoon system was fun.  I only wish there were some way to revert out of Dragoon mode, and also to cast magic outside of Dragoon mode.  Despite my complaints, I found most of the battle system to be not too annoying.

Gameplay (6/10): Wow. There's alot of backtracking.  This can get tedious; I think I went through some place three times.  Another issue I have with gameplay is that in disc 2, the game forces you to insert disc 1 again to get into some of the towns.  What nonsense is this?!  I don't think I've ever played another RPG that had this problem.  This is what lowers the score most for this section.  Other than the things listed above, I don't have any other issues with gameplay.

Overall (6/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  While Legend of Dragoon does not measure up to so many other RPGs out there, oddly I still enjoyed it.  This is certainly not the worst RPG out there, it's just not the best either.  Since it's so inexpensive now (at the time of writing this; July 2008), it wouldn't hurt to pick this game up and give it a chance.  You may at least get some amusement out of laughing at the bad dialogue.",3.0
Meh.  not that great.,3.0
"Ok for littler kids, but if your kid has an adult size head (or sensory processing issues so sensitive to different textures and pressures) go with adult size headphones.

These look like they'd be comfy, with the padding on top and around the ears, but for my 10 year old daughter who has an adult size head (think Vanna White, with her big head and tiny body...) it is not comfy at all. The band across the top presses on her head in an uncomfortable manner. You can try and bend it backwards to reduce the curvature, however, upon doing that it made the ear pads not compress enough for optimal sound. I think if your kid has a longer, narrower head then perhaps they'll be fine with these. However, if your kid has a heart, round, or square shaped head you may have troubles if their head is at all nearing adult size. The second issue is that she didn't like the stickers or know who the characters are supposed to be, and the pattern that comes on it is kinda boring (see the blue with white circles looking pattern on the image. Because we couldn't really get a good fit we can't honestly evaluate the sound quality. But with the poor fit we did have the sound was underwhelming.

She liked the individual controls for Bass, muting, game and chat that is on the cord, but again, because of the poor fit these features quickly became irrelevant. We have another set of gaming headphones, that while bulky and not very attractive, work quite well and she says she'd rather use those. So, for us, these were a bust.",3.0
"Get the torches out, of course.

I make the assumption that anyone reading this has played the WiiWare version.  Probably a faulty assumption.  But I make it anyway.  Thus I will be brief.

Everyone knows Final Fantasy IV (known as Final Fantasy II on SNES), and its cast of characters.  This collection contains that game with minor modifications as well as the interlude and the After Years.  The main game mostly stays true to the original except for name changes; I again assume you've played one of the other many re-releases of the game to be aware of these name changes.  I didn't have very many complaints about the remade Final Fantasy IV.  The difficulty is definitely greater than with the SNES version; beyond that it's a like-for-like experience mostly.

The Interlude is an introduction/transition to the After Years.  It details the period of time shortly after the end of Final Fantasy IV, Rosa's pregnancy, the creation of the Mysterious Girl, Kain's disappearance, and other characters being introduced.  It's short, but entertaining.  It's not required in order to play The After Years, but it does help.

The After Years is exactly what the name says it is: years after the events of Final Fantasy IV, the Mysterious Girl shows in various places; the Crystals are yet again in jeopardy, and the Eidolons are being captured one by one.  Nobody understands what is going on, and Golbez, last on the moon, is sent back to earth by FuSoYa to investigate what's going on.  This game introduces many new and some old characters to the mix, and by the game's near-end, you'll basically have free reign with just about everyone from Final Fantasy IV, new and improved (Tellah, I believe, is the only exception since he died), as well as new characters who are either students or children of the previous generation.  On the surface After Years seems like a dream come true for fans, and it is, from a storyline perspective.  I won't dig too deep into it, but my only real complaint about the After Years had to do with what I can only describe as ""Star Ocean: Second Evolution type obscenity"".

In other words, the difficulty on After Years is abnormally ramped at times.  You'll have to grind to survive, and if there's one thing I dislike, it's a game where grinding is forced in order to get through the game.  Ramuh, anyone?

The second thing, still related to this obscenity, is the final area referred to as The Depths.  I'm not going to spoil the events of the Depths.  Just know that it's OBSCENELY LONG.  For those who played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parasite-Eve/dp/B000038ABO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parasite Eve</a>&nbsp;and actually played through the Chrysler building, it's basically the same thing...except that every floor has at least 1 boss; some have up to 4 bosses.  These aren't piddly bosses either; the first group of 12 or so aren't too bad, but then they get progressively worse.  It almost feels like an optional side dungeon but it isn't.  You have to go through each and every one of these bosses in order to get to the final boss.  I could maybe see one boss per floor; but four?  And like I said, they get tougher.  I mean Kraken (same boss from Final Fantasy I) was dishing out 2000 damage with a regular hit to my strongest character, and one-hitter-quitters to one of my healers who had 4000 HP at level 99.  Really, Square Enix?

I didn't get to count how many bosses there were, because I stopped at Depth 14.  Reading online I see that there are over 30-something floors to the Depths.  Maybe my math is off, but that's a LOT of bosses.  What's worse is the fact the encounter rate is through the roof, so it's not like you're just cruising through the thing.

I give them credit for trying to have some fan service in here, but too much is too much, you know.

This collection is great for fans.  It is hurt by an unbalanced difficulty at the last dungeon that makes it a downright chore to finish.  It's fine to have multiple bosses as long as you mix things up and keep them interesting.  Unfortunately it was just an exercise in tedium, downright boring, and it really hurt the game experience.  Loved the story, but that last dungeon is just not cricket.",3.0
"Mass Effect was billed as a combination FPS/RPG game.  I usually play FPS games and thought this would be something different.  Well, it was that.  I don't know how RPGs usually play out, but the role playing in this game was painfully boring.  Conversations that plod along, endless elevator rides, running around trying to find bits and pieces.  I was expecting an FPS with a strong story and ended up mostly bored.

But the biggest nit?  Not being able to save during combat.  A couple of the battles were tough and I hated making it most of the way through only to have to start all over again.  And the final battle against the Big Boss was impossible.  I've only ever used cheats on 2 games and this was one of them.  I had to give myself the SuperGun to kill the guy.  That's always unsatisfying, but it was either that or give up.

Basically, this was a boring and occasionally frustrating game, although the storyline was excellent.  However, I doubt I'll try Mass Effect 2.",3.0
"Loved the setting for the game, but personally I didn't like the new emphasis on up-close fighting, versus the first game.  Enemies spawn and swarm around you again and again and again and they get right into your face.  For me that game mechanic got old pretty fast. Obviously some loved this kind of combat and loved the game, so take my comments with a grain of salt. A common complaint about the first game is that it was far too easy, and it seems the answer to that was to swarm the player with lot of spawning enemies in this sequel.  The rivet traps were a nice addition though and offered some strategy to the otherwise ""whack a mole"" combat.",3.0
"I bought this game based on all the ecstatic reviews, comparisons to master of orion, etc, etc. The game is boring. It has a neat premise. It's the kind of game I want to play and want to like. One of the things I do like is that your ship crews gain experience.

It's basically a lot like MOO2, only the combat is boring. That's really what kills the game for me. The whole ""buy off the pirates at the last second so they'll go kill the other opponents"" is just retarded. The tech trees are pretty boring.

Basically, the game has all of the right elements. It's like baking bread. They have the yeast and the flour and the sugar and etc. It has everything bread should have. But the bread just isn't good. I want to like it, I want it to be delicious, but it's very bland.

The thing that kills it is the combat. It's boring. There's no action. It's completely formulaic. There's no real chance for a come from behind victory, or for you to design a ship to exploit an opponent's weakness. You just group up a bunch of ships and sit there and yawn while your ships and their ships slowly whittle away at each other. It quickly becomes a foregone conclusion who is going to win. There's no drama, or action, or thrill. It's boring and very repetitive.

Not at all like Master of Orion. The factions are also boring and uninspiring. Basically I'd go load MOO2 and skip this title. I applaud their effort and their desire to make this sort of game, but it just doesn't have the magic that makes a game great. Quickly forgotten.",3.0
I bought this cause I did see it had single player option.  Did not see it required xbox live even with single player so could not play.  My fault for not seeing that but really?  Even for first player?  Had to return.,3.0
"This entry in the Star Ocean saga of games... fell flat. I managed to get a Day One edition several months after release, and I understand why now that I'm about 50% through the story.

The characters are all kind of flat, the story isn't as engaging as previous entries, and the gameplay gets stale quickly. You grind a lot and the gains don't pay off in many cases. It is nice getting a cameo from one character of Star Ocean 1, but not enough to redeem the game. It's kind of a sad entry, seeing as Star Ocean is normally amazing.",3.0
good,3.0
"The game is fun.  It is unlike other MMORPG's.  The combat is action oriented and relies more on player skill and control than just targeting something and pressing buttons till it is dead. Combat is fast paced, and enjoyable. However, some people coming from other MMORPG's may not like the controls and the combat, but others definitely will.  Anyone that is familiar with WASD FPS control with keyboard and mouse, should have no problem adapting.  The Instanced mission fights are really well planned out, and many of the boss fights are designed for using strategy and tactics, rather then straight up toe to toe brawling.

The missions are all story based, using DC characters, many with the same voice actors that have played them in movies and television. The cities of Gotham and Metropolis are huge and beautiful. The missions pull you right along, and there is very little grind. Character creation is good, but a bit limited. Power sets are also a little more limited than what many would expect.  They had mentioned several other sets being in the works prior to launch, but they weren't finished and didn't make the cut off point.  Maybe they will get added in the future. The main story line missions are easily soloable.  In addition to those, there are also a few group alert mission that are instanced and take place in unique places like Area 51, Gorilla Island, or a Hive base on the moon. There are also two types of PvP arena combat, one type you can play as your character, the other you can play as one of many DC iconic characters.

The interface is not what many MMORPG players have come to expect.  Part of the is due to the console and PC versions being developed side by side, but more of it has to do with limitations of the Unreal engine that they used. The action combat comes at the price of a clean interface.  Once you get used to it, it's not that bad, but some will hate it. Certain things about the interface still annoy me.  The biggest part is how primitive the chat system is.  It amazes me that Sony thought they could put out an MMO with such a weak chat interface.

Though I really enjoy the gameplay, the game does not hold up well as an MMO. There are only 30 levels, and they go by very quickly.  You can easily get to 30 within a week. Now they said long ago that that was their plan, because they wanted to focus on endgame content. The said that 50% of the content at release would be for endgame play. As good as that sounded, it didn't come close to meeting expectations. First of all, there is really only enough content for one character to run through. You start the game by picking a mentor, but all that really does is give you a different starting location and starting quest line.  After that you get the same quests as everybody else. You end up working for the other mentors too. If you create another character, other than the starting missions, you will be getting the same missions as your other character.  Even changing factions, many of the heroes and villains get essentially the same quests, but from the other perspective. Basically, not a lot of replay value for alts.

The bigger problem is that all the story based quests stop at 30, and the city is more or less abandoned for instances. What a waste. If you continue to solo, all you have are repeats of missions you have already played, at lower levels, that slightly bumped in difficulty to accommodate your new level. The exact same missions. If you have more than one character, this will bore you to tears. Slightly better, at 30 you get access to Duo missions, where you and one other player get to run instanced missions together. Once again, these are missions you have already run at lower levels, but they  have some surprise modifications to them, that make them interesting, the first couple of times through, but get old quick. You also get access to group (4 player) alert missions.  Again, some are just modified versions of lower level missions, but there are also some new ones Like Arkham Assylum, Smallville, and the Ace Chemical plant.  As fun as they are, when that is all there is to do, it loses its appeal fast. You also don't get much in the way of loot drops. You get some, but after you go through a few times, you pretty much have got all you are going to get.  This is because every mission rewards you marks, which you collect over time to purchase your iconic armor piece by piece, and that armor has to be better than any drops you get. So, ultimately, at level 30, you just instance grind the same handful of instanced missions over and over ad nauseam.  Creating a new character just means doing the same stuff over and over that much more.

Basically, what you end up with at 30 is a multiplayer game with a handful of maps you play on.  The cities are completely abandoned, and unused.  There is nothing massive about it, since everyone is tucked away in instances, and there is no reason at all to venture out into the cities, because they didn't create any content for you there. Add in the massive bugs with the queuing system, the messed up chat interface, and PvP exploits, and things went south quickly.  With the servers now practically ghost towns, getting groups is very nearly impossible unless you have friends of your own to play with, and there is little else to do.  The PvP servers might be faring a little better, but there are a lot of issue there too.

I played several months in beta, and played every power set, and most weapon sets, some multiple times. In the release version I have 3 level 30 characters and a few more mid to late 20's. Unfortunately it becomes painfully obvious that having multiple characters, just makes the instance grinding that much more draining. They have been adding new content over the last couple of months, but they have a long way to go if they want to pass it off as an MMO.  It really needs a complete overhaul. Right now it doesn't offer any more value than a typical multiplayer game.  There is nothing here that justifies a monthly fee.  I would love to see the game succeed, but they really need to Make some major changes to get people back.",3.0

"I got the Most wanted for GC before i got this version, and was soon disappointed in this version.  I had been expecting much better graphics for what I paid.  Most of the effort in making this game was put toward the length of it, the number of races in the career.  The phyics could have been better as well, hitting a wall during a turn at the wrong place can totally stop your car, wasting precious seconds.  And the same with accidently hitting another racing car, or traffic car.  Personally I would have saved my money had I known this was what the game was like.  To be fair, Ive gotten rather far, but its taken a while to get used to overcoming all the obsticles in this game.",3.0
"I really loved NWN1 and I expected a lot out of this game.  It's disappointing that the game is so buggy.  Here are some of the issues I've run across:

Occasional graphics card crashes (running on GeForce 6800 Ultra) and slow-downs.

Hotbar items mysteriously being swapped out or lost.

Keyboard input stops working or the camera starts spinning out of control.

Also, the game does not enjoy the same community atmosphere that the original did (and still does).  The default campaign is extremely linear and boring and just seems uninspired.

I really wanted to like this game but I just find myself playing it so little, so soon after purchasing it.  I did recently purchase Oblivion (after NWN2) and I see why the comparisons are made.  Oblivion has superior graphics yet runs without a hitch on my machine.  I'll keep the game on my machine for a while in hopes that more patches and community content will eventually salvage it.",3.0
I had high hopes for this game but it fell short of my expectations. My biggest complaint is its brevity. I finished this game in about 6-7 hours total on the normal difficulty level. That is just not enough game time for the cost of this game. The graphics and sound are great but the play is almost identical to the other COD titles. The AI is mediocre. I am a big fan of all WWII shooters but this title falls short. I will give credit to the voice overs. This feature did add a bit more of a human element to the game. I recommend renting this game before buying.,3.0

"I had no idea Microsoft made so many different versions of the 360; I've counted 5 so far Pro bundle, elite, halo, arcade and standard 20gb. I have to add PS3 was easier to buy only 2 versions 40g and 60g no question which to buy.

I bought the Xbox 360 Arcade bundle, I'll admit because it was cheaper out of the 5 versions, I read so many reviews about this red ring of death they all seem to get. I figure this way if it dies I didn't spend that much.

It did worked great, the games were amazing, love the charge and play wireless controllers ( I bought separate) I like how Xbox has a LOT of 4 player games so I can play with my kids, much Bigger choice then PS3. We have a Wii too and my 5 year old has a really hard time with the controller and moving his arms to keep up, with the Xbox 360 he has no problems at all.

But we did have some hardware problems with the 360; 1st it kept over heating, and won't turn on. We solved the problem by putting a Xbox 360 fan on the back. But only after 3 months the Fan broke and had to buy another Fan which cost $30 each!!

Then his screen started to blink on/off, nothing wrong with the TV it was the 360 AV cable. I bought the new HDMI cable (for $9) since he has a high def-TV and the blinking stop and the picture is so much better then the old xbox 360 AV cable.

I'm glad I went with the arcade one, because we don't use the online options my kids are to young. You can use online option with the arcade just other reviews complained about no space for online stuff, we don't have that problem. And we don't play any of the old xbox games which you can't play on arcade wihtout buying a drive extra $$. So for the Price the Arcade was a Good buy for us!!",3.0

"TS 12 is a simulator. TS12 is a SIMULATOR. TS12 IS A SIMULATOR.

TS 12 is not a game.

Why the emphasis on simulator - because that is what this software product does and does superbly; simulate the operation of a train.

If one knows little to nothing about trains and how they operate, the details about how to move them safely from one point to another and nothing about how to actually drive a modern disel locomotive, a not so modern diesel locomotive or a classic steam locomotive and one wants to know one will after diving into this software. TS12 is a simulator.

Getting tired of hearing that TS12 is a simulator yet? Good! Because if you are a gamer and want to jump in and drive a train from somewhere to somewhere else and get a reward for it or points for completing a mission or become a hero engineer then forget it because that is not what TS12 is about. You can hop into a train and go sight seeing if you wish and that can be a fun to a relaxing exercise. Yep - what every gamer is looking for.

TS12 is a simulator and a darn good one.

That said TS12 has issues. Graphics are dated - 2010 quality at best. In a town, in a large train yard with minimal activity and even a high end graphics card can get bogged down by a gamer's standards. SD texture vegetation are interlocked planes and those planes show and are ugly.

Auran brags on its 242 page enhanced manual. They shouldn't. There's not a lot of information in it. You'll get most of what you learn about operating a train from 4 very well put together and downright interesting and fun tutorials. Too bad the rest of TS12 content doesn't meet the same standard. The rest of the manual covers how to build routes and create sessions. If creating content is your thing and you seriously want to do it for Trainz - plan on divorcing your wife, andoning your kids and shooting your dog because you won't have time for anything else. The learning curve for using the development side of the simulator is the steepest of any I've used in over 30 years of gaming, scenario development, map building etc. Don your detective hat when trying to figure it all out because you are going to need it.

And finally - don't buy the marketing hype about the 100,000+ user submissions and all the content available for download. Oh - it's out there at various places, mostly on the publisher's site but much of it was/is produced by rank amateurs who get the big picture but can't be bothered with details and in TS12 the devil is in the details. TS12 depends on a massive database which must be up to date for user produced content to work the way it is intended to work. Uh huh...

I've been downloading what I considered would be interesting content for about 3 weeks or so now. Not one has come across without MISSSING DEPENDENCIES, Dependencies, dependencies... What are dependencies? They are the assets, graphics, scripts etc that make the independently developed content work. Problem is if the developer uses assets not available on Auran's Download station then you've got to hunt them down on your own. Good Luck with that. The process can run from being nigh unto impossible to as easy as a quick google search and grabbing it. I won't even discuss broken dependencies, faulty dependencies, dependencies with errors, obsolete dependencies - shall I go on? No! Let's not.

There are some quality 3rd party content vendors for Trainz DLC - if DLC is what you want - and you will if you like Trainz - then that's the route I would recommend.

In summary - if you are into hard core simulations (real sims not games disguised as sims) and you have an interest in RailRoading then Trainz may be for you. If you are a gamer then run, run and don't look back.",3.0

"First of all, I think the graphics are pretty ugly, for a new 360 game. (there may be some truth to the ongoing discussion regarding graphics on the PS3 vs, the 360). The folks at Criterion, that give us The Burnout Series, brought along that 'shimmering' effect to the graphics, and in some areas, it looks most unpleasant.
Second of all, there is no far away overhead view, like the other NFS games had. You only get close-closer-and closest. The soundtrack is more or less, intrusive and obnoxious. And lastly, each screen takes a bit of loading time, so your pressing on the A button and nothing is happening. There is that stall, in between each car choice and other screens.
I will say I am very happy with Amazons service. I ordered this game the afternoon before it was released, received it the next day, (a limited edition that I didn't request), and gave me a $20.00 store credit as well on my next game. Bravo Amazon!

"I have a an older P4 (from 2003-4)at 3.2Ghz processor and 1.5 GB of RAM with a 64MB Nvidia Graphics and an 80 gig HD, while that is now hopelessly out of date for today's games, its way too much for the ""Longest Journey""...which is getting to be very long with all the glitches.

First the darn thing had trouble installing, the third time around I thought I had it, until I started playing, the character build keeps going out.  The other problem is my screen refresh rate is too fast for the game, yet my computer warns me of consequences if  I lower it.
And on top of everything else, the game is really having problems with the laser mouse.

I just finished, again, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" PC-CDROM game (from 2002) today, the same day I'm trying to play the Longest Journey.  No problems with Harry.

I installed the two patches for the Longest Journey and I tried to cut down on screen enhancements, which might have made things worse.

It also maybe because of SP2 that the game is so uneven. The outline of the character is very 'choppy' as another poster describes.  I can't find a remedy.  I have spent 10 hours trying to get the game to stop cutting out on me and/or the main character's body disappearing sans her shoes and hair.

Good adventure games are not being produced like they used to be for  PC's.  Some of these older games are fantastic but they need to be re-released to able to run on faster speeds without cutting out.

You can tell that the game is overwhelmed.  The fact that there aren't any screen resolutions to choose from really limits its look to an almost 600X400 res.

I was really looking forward to playing this game but I can't take the flaws any more.

The recommended requirements for the Longest Journey are a P2 at 266mhz and a 4MB video card.  No wonder I'm having problems.

This is a good game but it needs be to re-released just to play on a middle of the road drive such as my own.  The game is too slow for my multi-drive to even be installed properly.

* As postscript to the review above, I am having better luck playing the game in a Windows 98/ME compatibility mode option (available through though the desktop icon, under the properties selection, and then the compatibility tab).  I now have access to the diary entries, which weren't available to me under XP play.  The characters are still very ""choppy"", but April is not disappearing and the game is not cutting out on me every 5 minutes, its cutting out on me every 20 minutes.  It is tedious, I am starting to lose interest in what's going to happen next. I do have the XP version double disc set, and again I can't get it to play on XP without the compatibility mode on.  mj",3.0

"I do not know a lot about cheating with the playstation I have to say and I really have not set down needing to cheat with a lot of games on the PS2 since I play more of hte nintendo or computer.

I know it could interupt the frequencies sending a different code variant with the cartridges, but i could not get the games to use the cheat codes and the games crashed more often. Mainly I used it for the unlimited lives kind of codes or unlimited money. Other than that I really think I wasted my money now, but I am new to the PS2 and disc systems. I would like to get a gamecube version and a Wii version and see if I could get them to work, but I am not sure after trying this.

"Alan Wake is proof that video game conventions and movie conventions cannot completely exist on the same plane, at least in terms of the current gen technology. As hard as Alan Wake tries to be ""more"" than just a game in both it's story and structure, it ends up backfiring on several occasions ultimately ruining the experience. Behind the David Lynch-esque facade of every day people and places, Alan Wake succeeds in telling a story structured like a dream, but in doing so it falters in the most important aspect, the game play. It's obvious from the outset that Alan Wake is a nice looking game, at least in terms of scenery. Trees blow in the wind, bushes sway as Alan brushes by them, and the scenic vistas are near breathtaking. The sound is great as well, rivaling Dead Space in creating a truly horrific and foreboding atmosphere. However, the game is so simply designed, and levels are so boringly directed that all the beauty in Bright Falls can't save the game play. Alan Wake is intense a lot of the time, but the intensity is more so due to the limits placed on your character, than by the creation of expert developers. Here are a few things to consider before you pay full price for this game that promises a lot, but ends up backing out in the end.

CHARACTER MOVEMENT
For me this was one of the games biggest weak points. It seems that Alan Wake isn't sure what it wants to be. It appears on the outset to be a survival horror game where ammo is scarce, and combat isn't the focal point. However, it's evident that after the first couple of episodes that Alan Wake is just a glorified action game with survival horror elements. The game involves a lot of twitch reaction along with precise shooting and aiming. The problem is that controls are sluggish and Alan is given a lot of physical handicaps to ensure the game stays thrilling, even to the detriment of your enjoyment and progress. For instance Alan's jump is awkward and the game at times demands rather precise platforming which can become frustrating. Alan comes equipped with an evade move, but the move is clunky and slow in it's execution. But the biggest shortfall in Alan's character movement has to be his inability to sprint for more than five seconds. I understand that Alan is a writer, not a marathon runner, but he sure knows how to use a gun like a marksmen, so why the running weakness? You will be running a lot in this game, from cops and the taken, and these scenarios are by far the most frustrating moments of the game. You'll sprint for a quick moment, slow down, then eventually stop so Alan can catch his breath, it all looks good, but it's not realistic, and it causes the game to grate at times. Character limitations can help ground a game in realism, but Alan Wake is not a game that should strive for realism, after all you're fighting a formless horror with beams of light!

CUT SCENE PRESENTATION
It's no secret that Alan Wake has been in development for a long time. You would think that this time would have been spent polishing the cut scenes since they are important to this game which considers itself a psychological thriller, and for the fact that they take up a good chunk of the game play. However, in Alan Wake's case it's the opposite. The game engine seems to have been overhauled during game play, Alan Wake is one of he best looking 360 titles. But the cut scenes suffer from a lot of issues. For starters the game attempts to look like a serialized television show, with both recaps and cliff hanging endings. The idea isn't original, but the real problem is that the television style cut scenes actually look less cinematic than most games because it tries to hard to emulate a TV show. It's obvious that TV shows don't have the same budgets or talent as films, and this causes a lot of shows to be underwhelming in both their content and technology, and this is exactly what Alan Wake suffers from. It looks cheap, and doesn't pull you into it's world or get you to sympathize with it's characters. Among Alan Wake's other cut scene problems are really poor dialogue, over the top voice acting and some truly horrid facial/lip animations. Alan Wake's wife in particular has one of the creepiest faces I've seen in a AAA title. To put it simply, a game like Alan Wake lives and dies with how it's story is told, and as far as the cut scenes go they're incredibly underwhelming and fail to pull you into the rather pretentious story.

LEVEL DESIGN
Alan Wake's biggest problem, and the main reason I gave the game only three stars is due to the poor level design. Alan wake is a very simply designed game, almost to a laughable point. You are shown wide open vistas, grand mountains and looming forests, but you never get to explore them. Simply put, Alan Wake is a corridor shooter set in an outdoor environment. You can stroll a little bit off the path and at times find a little ammo or batteries in a shallow cave, but for the most part you walk through the woods or up a path and never get to stray off it or take on a location from another direction. Even though you always move towards a straight path, the game guides you from waypoint to waypoint, almost annoyingly so negating any real feeling of naturalistic exploration. It seems that Alan Wake tries to separate itself by creating a game that takes place mostly outdoors, but the outdoor environments are only window dressing to a conventional corridor shooting experience. Above all, Alan Wake's biggest misstep is the episodic level design it implements that completely takes you out of the immersion of the story and environments. The game is segmented into day scenarios that take place in areas around Bright Falls. These segments never have weapons in them, and Alan is only given the ability to walk. Even though these scenarios take place in buildings and homes all the doors are locked, except the door that you're supposed to use to forward the scenario. There is absolutely no exploration during these moments. Not only are the segments boring and uninspired, but they're incredibly constrictive and formulaic. You know you're not going to run into any conflict since the developer's chose to take away some of your characters abilities. Following these day scenarios are the night ones, where you do all the shooting and fighting with the taken, poltergeists, and spirit birds (the only three enemies you face.) Weapons, ammo and batteries from each episode don't carry over to the next one, as you're mysteriously stripped of them by the day time. Some episodes take all your armaments away completely forcing you to run with just a flashlight, something the restrictive character movement wasn't made for. This takes away from the strategy of ammo conservation and weapon upgrades vital to survival horror games, since you don't have a continuing inventory. The episodes also skip time and place and conveniently place you where you need to be at any time, never giving you the feel of being in a real place and time. Needless to say the poor level design rips you from the immersion of the game, and plays similar to games from the 1990s, not a complement in this day and age.

Alan Wake is a game that has an identity crisis and suffers from poor design decisions that over shadows the work and time put into it's development. I applaud Remedy for trying something different story wise, but the game buckles under it's own pretensions and technological restrictions. The audio and visuals are on par with the industries best, but everything else in Alan Wake doesn't live up to the titles promise. Bad character movement decisions and underwhelming cut scenes are a few problems that can't be over looked in this type of game. If you love survival horror or action horror games you owe it to yourself to rent Alan Wake, the game does contain some terrifying moments, and the atmosphere is great at night. The game isn't very long, so I don't suggest paying full price for it. Some of the games major faults may strike it as unplayable for those not committed to story driven horror games, especially Alan Wake which has a broken pace some may find maddening. It's not a bad game per se, it's just not a great game either.  It has a foundation that can be vastly improved in latter installments to create a better, more enjoyable game. However, as it stands Alan Wake leaves a lot to be desired.",3.0
"The game is nice to play at times, but it is not as much fun as we thought it would be.",3.0
"I just don't know what to think about this game. I've played Alan Wake and enjoyed it, but this...this is something different. Remedy tried something new here with the whole ""choose your own adventure"" feel and it sorta works. The episodes are of decent quality and I legitimately got into some of them and almost forgot I was playing a game, but herein lies the problem. I feel as if the episodes detract from the game and break whatever immersion you may have felt while playing. These aren't your average cut scenes, but instead completely live action and I think that's where this all goes wrong for me.

The game itself is enjoyable. Gameplay is decent, but you can tell the Xbox had a hard time digesting the 1080p visuals, so everything is scaled to 720 or 900 in order for the poor XO to keep up. The visuals are...grainy and I believe that's intentional, but you'll notice it at first if you're coming from playing something else and quickly forget it again. The special effects are top notch, but the battles are almost LESS creative than in Alan Wake. Combat is mediocre at best and quickly gets repetitive, nothing to see here in terms of combat.....so there's an awesome story to make up for it, right?

Well....sorta? The story as told by the game is fragmented and can be hard to follow, but the episodes clear this up a bit if you take the time to watch them all. The kicker here is that the actual meat of the story is in the collectibles you pick up along the way. The emails, phone calls and letters you pick up give you a lot of insight on what's going on and I suggest you read them, but that gets tiring too. I read through a ton of them before I gave up and told myself I would read them at the end. Remedy missed an opportunity to integrate these collectibles into the actual story and it's a telltale sign that the release, even after so many years, was rushed...boo Microsoft and Remedy. You guys had a REALLY interesting story here and blew it by making people read until their eyes bleed in order to really appreciate it, no bueno.

So if you liked Alan Wake, I think the game play will feel familiar to you and you'll more than likely enjoy Quantum Break, but if you're expecting something ground breaking, you'll be sorely disappointed.",3.0
"I enjoyed this game, the platforming is great and the game art is even better. There is a nice level of difficulty, where it generally isn't too hard to get to the finish line, but it can be very difficult when you go after the large coins. However, my experience was ruined by a game breaking glitch, or at least a combination of bad luck, poor level planning, and the lack of a very basic feature. The basic feature that I'm talking about, one that is found in most current games, is the ability to restart from the last checkpoint. Instead you are only allowed to restart the level or quit, and because of this multiple times I was forced to search for something allowing me to commit suicide when I screwed up and wanted to back to the check point. I could have lived with this and still enjoyed the game, until I came upon the very end of one of the ice levels. It was the ice level that introduced breakable ice cubes, and it was the very end where you have to kill 3 big fire breathing monsters that have a platform on their heads. The goal here (I think) is to break certain ice cubes and crush the monsters (or maybe just get behind them and punch them), I was trying to do this when I somehow managed to get trapped between the monster's platform and the ice cube above it. I was completely trapped, bouncing endlessly, there was nothing I could do but go to the beginning of the entire level. It was just such a let down, the level was the hardest yet, and I had spent a lot of time going after most of the large coins and the other things (whatever they were, the little circle faces) that I just didn't want to keep playing. So instead I just traded the game in. I would only take 1 star away for the unlikely occurrence (I doubt I could replicate it), but I also found the game a little repetitive, hence the 3 star rating.

This is by no means a bad game, especially at the price it is now, and I'm sure others could have a completely different experience than mine. So even though I gave the game 3 stars, I would recommend it to others.",3.0

"Well it's been awhile, but MP is finally here. Did it live up tot he name? Almost. First the good. Graphics are sweet. Unreal atmoshere and smooth framerate. The textures are blurry for a GC game, but they're decent. The lighting and particles are a sight to see. Sound is really well done as well. No voice acting at all but the sfx and music is top notch with pII support. But essentially, some fundamental gameplay flaws make the game needlessly frustrating. One of the flaws is the controls. I disagree about the current perspective being ""ideal"" - even when jumping, it'd be nice to look down at my feet before I leap and gauge how close to the platform's edge I am, but that is not possible. Jumping from and to platforms is almost always harder than it should be, not to mention the pot you're in when an enemy manages to get behind you when you're fighting a pack in front of you. Dual-analog would've made this perfection. Even after finishing the game just under 14 hours, I still find the controls unecessarily prohibitive. I know that a few weaksauce types fear and abhor the free look style controls of Halo/TS2, but there really should have been an option. Funny how the two aspects I *don't* like - the dull-as-dirt scanning and the limited prespective controls - came from Miyamoto. Again, that's what's symptomatic about the ""new"" Nintendo - dumbing their games down just a little too much with overthink and overdesign. The morphing ball is also a nice touch though, although nothing that evolves the game.
I can say, that I would enjoy Metroid quite a bit more if it had the option for a non-fixed free look, and there is NO situation I've encountered in over 14 hours of play that would've been compromised by it. It's missing for one reason, and that reason is that console-style FPS controls are very daunting to novice gamers as well as many ""hardcore"" gamers, since they've only been around for a short time. I know a couple people who breathed a sigh of relief when they heard the controls ""were like Goldeneye and not Halo,"" just because they couldn't really adjust to the free-look style. This doesn't excuse the lack of an OPTION to change the controls, though. I would also enjoy better visor controls, since the D-pad requires me to take my hand off the analog stick in order to scan in the heat of battle (to find boss weak points), although some of the blame could be leveled at the Gamecube controller and it's relative paucity of buttons. There's also a real lack of Zelda-style context sensitivity which makes these various buttons/pad presses necessary.
Also, the game is a single player game, with no multiplayer whatsoever, whch really brings dow the replay value and the game is pretty short as is. But all in all, it is a decent game. Just don't expect it's gameplay to match it's visual and sound presentation.",3.0

"Pros: Likable characters, good music and sound, good voice acting, good GUI

Cons: Outmoded and too-frequent random battle system, excessively long dungeons, drab story, twists are super obvious, tedious FMVs when traveling between planets, final sequence is long and tedious (momentum killer!), awkward loading times

This game instantly reminded me of Final Fantasy XIII - it's sort of action RPGish, you start in a desert town, you go on (optional) hunts for beasts.  It's very playable, enjoyable most of the time (despite a few annoying design choices), but is pretty forgettable.  The story won't impress you, though you'll probably like most of the characters.  There's a lot of running around and getting bogged down by excessive random battles, and many of the monsters are more irritating than need-be.  As an example, some monsters come with a shield that can only be taken out with a specific gun - until they're hit with that gun, they're essentially invulnerable.  So what's the problem?  You'll be switching between the Shield Blaster and your actual gun of choice seemingly every other battle, and it gets very old.  Maybe they could have assigned an unused button to instantly alternate guns?  That would be an improvement, but would still be irritating because these monsters typically come in large packs, and you have to go through and make sure you remove the shield from each and every one, while your moron allies sit and fruitless swing at them, usually getting spanked in the process.  Another strange quirk is with loading times - right on the game's DVD case it says ""no loading times"".  Well, pretty much a lie.  Press Triangle to open a menu, and GUI will pop up... but will not accept any input for a second or two.  This is presumably the time it takes to load - just because you replace a black screen with an inert menu doesn't mean there are no loading times!  Still though, this is a good game, pretty much what I've come to expect from PS2 RPGs - worth playing, but contains none of the magic of the best PSX and SNES games.",3.0

"This game could be sold as downloadable Content but in this co-operate era who wants to lose money so cashing it as new game at $57.

pretty much same amazing and difficult engine of Fifa10 with player now standing instead of bending like PES .Graphics are same but animation of celebration and Crowd is much improved .Two Button game play is great addition for new comers in game. Penality kicks are little improved but not ground breaking just some tweaks to chip ball in. Goal looks bigger in this edition then fifa10. No lag on line.

"Pros:
The mouse is excellent in many ways. Smooth movement, great tracking, high-speed polling, perfect low profile Intellimouse-inspired ambidextrous shape (no wrist pain! yay!), side buttons on both sides, great surface texture (I got the rubberized version), highly customizable, awesome cord, the weight is perfect, and it looks very cool without being tacky (disable the pulsating glow in the software to eliminate any residual tackiness).

Cons: (If you can live with these, it's a 5-star mouse).
The button clicks are just way, way, way too loud. I know gamers want feedback, but this will kill your ears in a working environment after a couple of hours. (This is probably going to be a deal-breaker for me as my ears are easily irritated.)
The 2 side buttons on the right are awkwardly placed. My right ring finger always rests over the division between the buttons making neither comfortable to press without stretching. (My solution: Assign both buttons to the same back command and press in the middle.)
The mouse wheel has an insane amount of resistance to move it to the next notch. The notching is just far too pronounced and more than any mouse I've ever tried. The click-in also takes a lot of force. And even worse, the whole wheel seems to be loose in the body because it makes a plastic clacky sound every time I wheel forward but not usually when I wheel backward. It just makes it feel cheap.
The SteelSeriees Engine software is bloated like a hog -- 216MB of memory FOR A MOUSE DRIVER! I've heard reports of crashes on boot and such, but I haven't had that yet.
Even though SteelSeries' comparison chat says this Raw version has the same customizability as the non-Raw version, it does not. You cannot tweak any of the finer mouse details like jitter correction, acceleration, pickup distance, etc. The only customizations you get are mouse buttons / macros, counts per inch, and polling rate.

** UPDATE: 1 day after I wrote this review, the mouse suddenly started tracking VERY badly on the brand new large cloth gamer mousepad I bought here and had been using for the last several days without a flaw. I also tried it on a plastic-surface pad I also just bought here and it can't track worth a darn. It's almost as if it's suddenly become extremely low res even though the settings are still at max in the software. I can't even move it across the screen an inch without it struggling. I tried it in 3 different USB ports and then on 3 different computers with the same results. I started using the mouse on Thursday and it died on Sunday. Wow... I did not expect this level of QC from an elite brand like SteelSeries. I just tried updating the firmware on it. It crashed at 15% the first time, then made it to 100% the second time. No difference. This mouse is toast. :(

Background:
I am a hardcore computer user (work and fun). I'd say I sit in front of my desk about 14-16 hours a day. I've become so accustomed to my input/output interface that when one component dies and I have to replace it (like my keyboard), it just totally throws me off and slows down my work. So normally I go to the extra effort to fix my tools, but when my mouse started going on the fritz and I couldn't fix it, I bit the bullet and started researching mice.

I have been using a Microsoft Intellimouse Optical mouse for about 12 years now. It is one EXCELLENT piece of hardware. Ambidextrous shape, a perfect size for a claw grip hold, the shape doesn't cause me wrist pain like every one of those overly tall palm-rest Logitech mice, the oversized left/right side mouse buttons are easily accessible no matter how you're holding it without having to stretch and contort your thumb like the mice with both buttons on the same side, the buttons have just the right balance of travel distance, feedback, and low noise, it tracks well, it's light-weight, and it lasted through 12 years of daily abuse! I was so sad to have to try to find a replacement for it. And as you can probably tell by now how picky I am (ie: connoisseur), it was going to be a tall order to live up to this one.

I spent probably a week research every mouse out there in every price range. My criteria were it must be low profile (no wrist pain!), have at least 4 buttons and a wheel, the side buttons must be on opposite sides of the mouse (therefore the mouse must be ambidextrous), and it must be wired. To my shock, this eliminated 95% of the mice on the market, including gaming mice like Razer. It seems Logitech's pushing of gigantic, palm-rest, wrist destroying ""ergo"" mice with thumb-twisting side button layout has infected just about every other manufacturer out there. All of the few mice I found that sort of fit within my criteria like Microsoft's Comfort Mouse 4500 just fell flat on their faces for a variety of reasons. I'm sorry to see what cheap garbage MS mice have become in the last 12 years. Needless to say, I was thrilled when I discovered the SteelSeries Sensei. It met all my criteria perfectly. In fact, it seems to actually be the successor to the MS Intellimouse as I found information on SS's website that said they had actually made an SS MS Intellimouse years back. So I'm guessing either SS designed the original Intellimouse or MS licensed the design to them. Either way, it's the closest thing to an Intellimouse you can find anywhere.

I ordered it. I waited with anticipation. It was scheduled to be delivered at the end of Sept, but Amazon ended up getting it to me before the end of August. Wow! Had I finally find the perfect mouse to replace my trusty old IMO?

After a few days of testing, I'm very sad to say I did not. The mouse is a mixture of excellent and terrible all rolled into one. (See the pros/cons at the top.) I'm going to give it another week of testing, but I'm almost certain I'll be returning it.

Why, oh why Microsoft did you abandon the perfect mouse?",3.0
"I feel like the product is not worth the price.

I love officially that this is an officially licensed product and I love the idea behind it, but I feel like it is cheaply constructed and will ultimately not protect the amiibo cards very well.

The pages are bound too tightly and as you fill up your album it will become harder to flip pages without causing damage to the innermost amiibo cards.

It has been difficult for me putting away cards in the innermost slots and even more difficult to remove them for use.

It is a cute product, and I did buy the albums for the four card series available at the moment. I just wish the design was thought through better, like having rings inside instead or having a larger margin between the pins and the seams of the card sleeves.

For these being $25 I feel like the quality should be much higher. Definitely not the Nintendo item quality I am used to.",3.0
"This is one of the rare instances where I pre-ordered a game.  I'm a long time Battlefront fan and have played several of the original games on the Xbox and the Sony PSP.  For those who aren't familiar with Battlefront, you should know that it's an arcade style FPS.  It doesn't have much in the way of depth (RPG elements).  That's not a bad thing though . Sometimes you might prefer a beer & pretzels type game that you can just put in and quickly start playing with some friends.  So, far I really like what I see.  The game is gorgeous!  Tremendous graphics and sound.  You feel like you are bathing in Star Wars.  The controls are terrific.  I've played the the training missions, so far and have no complaints.  I did notice, however, that there is NO campaign mode.  Very disappointed with that and it costs this game a star in my view. I noticed the game really really wants you to buy a season pass and has some in-game purchases, but I'm not biting until I play the game more. I'll post an update after a while to see if I've changed my stance on this game.  So far, it's thumbs up!

Update 04/10:  Played this game for a while now and I'm taking a star off.  This game is most definitely not worth a $60 price tag.  It's about as dumbed down an arcade shooter as you can get.  You have no control over your spawning.  In old Battlefront you could choose to spawn at any base your side had control of.  Not here.  The game decides where you spawn........and it's often in very bad spots.  Let's put it this way.  If the other side has a hero in play, you will be guaranteed to be placed near where that player is.  It's happened to me way too many times to be a coincidence.  I think the game serves you up to the hero on purpose.  My next point of contention is the lack of any meaningful single player content.  It gives you crumbs, like the Survival mode which is boring beyond belief.  Then you have almost nothing in the way of player customization or advancement.  You get to choose from a variety of different faces, hairstyles and some lame emotes.  With only 11 different weapons available, there's not much replay value for the long haul.  That's sort of why I haven't played it all that much in the last few months.  The game just doesn't give you a whole lot.  Although they did include the very laughable diorama.  Yes, a diorama.  You unlock various diorama pieces throughout the game and then they appear int he diorama.  LOL.  They threw in the these weak little add ins to give you the illusions that you are actually getting some content with this game.  If you are one of the unlucky folks who ponied up $100+ for the game plus the ridiculous season pass, you have really been hosed.  This is a $30 game at best and the extra DLC content is just what should have been included in the original.",3.0

There are many other limitations such as an 80 file limit to a folder on the SD card - that includes save games which all save to the same folder. There is no save state either.
This WILL play some GameBoy games but you have to use a converter and emulator which works reasonably well.
If you want to use this and you're willing to put many hours into setting it up right - it will be good. If you want something that works great and is solid it's going to be a disappointing experience.",3.0
"I don't understand all the hype! Yes this is a descent keyboard but in my opinion it is WAAAAY overpriced.
One major flaw in my opinion is the lower halves of the multi keys do not light up at all. Nothing, zero! So if you are in a dim environment, you better know which keys are what cause you won't be able to see them. For $160.00 this is unacceptable.
The board itself is nicely constructed and feels solid. I ordered with the Brown switches and they are perfect for gaming and general tying. The reds are just to soft for me.

"Diablo III is possibly the most hotly anticipated PC game of all time, and considering the huge following of Diablo II, it had some big shoes to fill. The game we got has ended up being very divisive- a lot of folks don't like it much, as evidenced by its rating here. I love it to pieces, but a lot of the experience SURROUNDING the game is hugely disappointing. I'll spare you summaries and just jump to the key points:

GAMEPLAY
The area where D3 most shines. Gameplay feels a LOT like Diablo II, but a bit more dynamic and alive- knockback actually launches enemies (and you) into the air, there are dodge moves, and magic spells are a lot more diverse than in the past. The game feels even more arcade-like than its predecessor with big, flashy fights that are a lot of fun (if a little confusing at times). Purists aren't all happy with how skills work- unlike Diablo II you can unlock every skill for your character, and they level up automatically as you do. This means you probably won't build 3 or 4 barbarians for kicks, but it also means no more working on your character for weeks only to realize you built them wrong. Controls are slick and responsive.

GRAPHICS
Diablo III is a direct evolution from Diablo II artistically. That means you see everything from a locked 3/4 perspective; any zooming during cutscenes is lenticular and not physical. During gameplay you cannot zoom or rotate. This is all done to accomodate the clever use of sprites and low-poly models to simulate a much more detailed world than actually exists in-game. It works to a point. Outdoor environments look outstanding, and everything has a sort of painterly look to it. However here and there a tree will look a bit flat or a character model will show a rough corner. This game was in development a long time and it shows. I can't help but feel that the graphics also suffer so that the game can accommodate the weaker computers of Blizzard fans who thusfar have only played the lower-requirement World of Warcraft. That's great and all, but I don't like my experience suffering so Blizzard can double-dip on its fanbase.

SOUND
It's a Blizzard game. They do game audio better than just about anyone, except maybe Valve. Not really much else to say, if you played Diablo I and II you can guess about how this one will sound.

MULTIPLAYER
Here's where things begin to unravel a little. Multiplayer itself is fast and seamless- find your friends, join their game, PROFIT. But the general chat channel is full of spambots, and you will get constant friend requests from spammers. Welcome to the Blizzard social hell that WoW players have endured since the dawn of time. Crooked BS and suspect invites are so rampant that generally you will end up just playing with friends and gradually friending THEIR friends- a sad thing when starting a fully public game is pretty easy. But what should be a fun experience with neat strangers gets old fast when a couple scammers jump in your game.
Two more downsides are that multiplayer servers hold only 4 people (half of Diablo II's limit) and PVP, a much advertised feature, does not actually exist yet.

SUPPORT
The dealbreaker for many. Diablo III requires that you be logged into Battlenet to play. Battlenet undergoes more maintenance than Cher's bustline. If you were one of the thousands of people who skipped work to play on launch day you got a nice 6 hour break in the middle of the day when your game was unplayable. It's gotten better, but there are still outages, particularly in the EU. The number of times Diablo II went down for me? ZERO. Just saying. So far the always-online aspect SEEMS to at least prevent cheating, but then I only play with people I know.

THE ENDGAME
Diablo fans know you don't beat the game in one playthrough- it now takes 4 thanks to a new difficulty, Inferno. Unfortunately, somewhere in your road to victory you will probably hit a wall. At level 60 you stop leveling and only improve through gear, which means eventually you must stop by the AUCTION HOUSE. 2 are on tap, a cash one and one that uses in-game currency. Both are grossly inflated. A lot of people resent having to buy and sell in order to progress, rightly saying that the auction mechanic hurts immersion and slows gameplay. I don't mind it but I won't call those people wrong either.

OVERALL
Diablo III is in most respects the game I wanted- an action-packed hack'n'slash with adequate graphics, great sound, and fun multiplayer. Could it be better? Absolutely, and given Blizzard's reputation for perfection (everyone forgets Rock'n'Roll Racing) that may cost it more points than it would another game. It's hard not to balk at all the Warcraft conceits slipping into Diablo, or Blizzard's dodgy servers, or how many ways the game feels scaled back. BUT it's still a Blizzard game, it's STILL Diablo, and it's STILL better than 9/10 of what's on the market. Here's hoping they keep improving it with patches, and the player base sticks with it.",3.0
"I think the game is too subtle and simple to me, it is not a bad game, but I figured I will have more stronger battles and techniques and indulged storyline.

The story here is weak, it is all about chasing dreams, I guess that should be obvious from its title, however, since square Enix is the developer (which is known for the best RPG games), that gave more motivation to try this game out, the game can be beaten within 20 hours and honestly It felt little bit childish for me, I guess if you are over 21 you might feel the same way.

Bottom line: if you love Disney characters (which are unplayable in this game)and action RPG you might like this game, otherwise, if you are looking for a a more deeper and sophisticated RPG this might not be your cup of tea.",3.0
"I thought the game was decent

until I grew hopelessly bored.  Spoiler Alert

Your best tactic is lunging at peeps, jumping up,

and meeting their heart with your claw.  There's satisfying, brutal

combat with a real-time upgrade system.  You can further your abilities

by finding or buying supplemental powers, which can be managed easily.

You can switch costumes once you find trophies (like riddler trophies).

The mission structure is archaic, from the N64 era; however climbing

an Amazonion tower was kinda cool (of course you have to smash modern tech on top).

Some cut scenes can't be skipped.  The worst parts of this game were the unthoughtful

confusion going on, which rampantly trodd on the integrity of this ordeal.

I would've added to the title - ""Wolvies Revenge (when does it end?).""

get you this game.  If you know how quality video games play like,

don't dare own this game, because it will bite you in the end.",3.0

"Why does this game need cursing and blood to be good? My teen son loves the previous Tomb Raider but this one seems to be taking itself too seriously and I will pass due to the rating. Too bad...Games should not need to have the cursing or blood in them to make them better or more appealing. At the least, these games should have the option to tun off the ""M"" content. Yea, yea, it could disrupt the flow of the storytelling, but if I need to hear ""F- This"" and ""Holy S-"" or need to see blood splattering everywhere to drive the story, then it's not much of a story is it?

When looking at the ratings for game I'm interested in and seeing seeing ""blood and gore"", or ""intense language"" I don't say ""oh joy! this game is for me"" I am more interested in a game's content. The Uncharted series drives me nuts for the same reason - it's a good story on its own and does not need the added fluff - that's all it is: Fluff.

I the spirit of full disclosure I did not play the game, so, given the high ratings here I also gave it high marks for fun, but overall I think these developers need to ask themselves what is really necessary to drive a good story.",3.0
This game is very beautiful but the puzzles are too easy and the story (in my opinion) is a bit hard to follow. I haven't finished it yet but so far i'm already lost as to what the story is about. At some points it's about a child then it's about someone else and it's kinda confusing. The game play itself is very nice and smooth.,3.0

"This is a fairly limp attempt at a God of War clone in Castlevania clothing. It's got all the requisite vampires and werewolves and gargoyles you could ask for, but the action is just like God of War... you have two attack buttons, you can chain them together, you can air combo, grab, change weapons, and throw a special weapon, but it's not nearly as well done. If God of War were never around, this would be refreshing but if you're going to clone God of War, at least be a little original or do it better. This game didn't need that anyways; I've been playing Castlevania since the first one, and it doesn't need crazy in-your-face romping action. The gothic scenery and medieval weaponry only needs some basic handling, and the rest can be a puzzler-jumper with some dark romantic storylines. I really would have preferred Konami made this a more realistic action game since the PS3 can do wonderful graphics.",3.0
"First off I think the game is too expensive for $70. Its worth about $50 considering all of the extra content in it after the first person campaign.
Consider Tenchu for $40. I think that game leaves you with a better impression of ""the life of a Ninja"" anyway (i.e. stealthy assassin). It plays like the Hitman series only, instead of guns and fiberwire, you're using swords and shurikans.
Before I get into my complaints I'd like to mention the wasted talent. The game has some of the best artwork I have seen on the Xbox supported by good music and sound effects. Its obvious a lot of effort has been put into this.
The fighting system is OK. Its not the best I've seen nor the worst.
Now to my complaints.
Two things in which the game needs an overhaul in (and the 2 reasons I did not bother buying the game after an initial rental) are the often mentioned saving system and (my personal favorite) the counter-productive camera system.
I don't normally mind a ""check point"" type of saving system, but for this game I have made an exception. First off the check points have to be looked for and made use of as opposed to just crossing over a point in the game. This isn't such a big deal, but I am not really a fan of it. What really sucks about this system though are the save point locations. Sometimes they are 10 or 15 minutes apart (when you find all of them). When I die in the game I am not really interested in redoing 15 minutes worth of a level. Once or twice is OK really, but after that I'm getting aggravated. The worst part about this saving system is when dealing with masters or sub-masters. The first time you go through a level you never really know when to expect a master (even when you are looking for one). When you come across a master you have no way to back out to ready yourself. You just hit a cut scene and boom you are in for the initial beating. When you die (and you will die) you get spawned back at your last check point which tends not to be right by the master. This could be 10 minutes back and now you have to redo everything between the last save point and the master. The idea here is to fight through everything and to take on that master yet again, but this time you are supposed to be prepared for him. It doesn't matter. You'll probably die a second time and a third etc. etc. each time being respawned at the last save point 10 minutes earlier (now half an hour into it). Very quickly I learned (as I am sure everyone else who plays this game did) to make a ""clear path"" between that last save point and the master. Basically after you get burned the first time by a cut scene and subsequent death by the hands of a master and you are respawned at your last save point you make it a point to kill off all minions (clearing out a level) and resaving before taking on a master again (now that you know were he will be). This way one can cut down on the time it takes to get to a master for a rematch because there is no other resistance now. Even with this it still can take 5 minutes and, as with that dude with the weight problem on top of the zeppelin, death can take only seconds. This saving system only encouraged WORK arounds for players to incorporate into their game. Anyways, I got real tired with this and my patience eventually gave out.
As far as the camera system is concerned; it sucks! There's no better way to put it. What where the guys at Tecmo/Team Ninja thinking? For a game this fast why didn't they think of adding a camera lock feature. Either lock it behind your player for the normal (and proven) 3rd person view, or at least allow players to lock the camera to an enemy of his/her choice. All they provided was a ""handy"" snap feature applied with the right trigger button. This does shift the camera behind the player but it doesn't keep it there. As soon as you move in any direction other than forward you lose sight of were you are heading because the camera doesn't adjust to stay behind you. With this you end up seeing many angles of ninja gaiden. Again with the graphics it's neat to see, but how is this practical? Instead of seeing where I am going, or who I am engaging, I am watching myself reorientate to the unexpected shift in view. Towards the end of the rental I found myself snapping the right trigger once every 2 seconds (approx.) just so I could keep a bead on where I was heading. This sort of system could of been acceptable for Gemma Onimusha, or the Resident Evil series Onimusha was modeled after but not for something this quick. I still shake my head thinking about it.
I'll say this much for the game. It is as frustrating as Ninja Gaiden games of the past have always been, only in different ways now.",3.0
Story and characters didn't grab me. The graphics and overall layout of the world is very good. The customization and combat is decent. What really makes the game disappointing for me is the side missions and exploration. It feels far too much like a MMO. There's too many repetitive fetch quests and the exploration just feels like one big checklist. It's a good RPG but I don't think it comes close to many classic RPG's of the last few console generations.,3.0

"We have 3 trivia types of games for Wii:  Smarty Pants, You Don't Know Jack (YDKJ), and Jeopardy!  Smarty pants isn't horrible but its the least favorite of those 3 comparable games.  It can be fun and it can also be very frustrating.  Sometimes you can play an entire game where the questions are very easy or very difficult within the same game.  When it's playing easy, medium, and hard at the same time its fun, otherwise it's annoying if they're all too hard or too easy.  Some of the questions are just so off the wall like ""What company published [insert book name here]""?  This games tries to be like Trivial Pursuit but doesn't do as good of a job at it as Jeopardy! does being like Jeopardy.  And YDKJ is just a highly unique and entertaining game.  Other annoyances of Smarty Pants are: When nobody answers correctly the correct answer is given but it goes by in an eye blink and you often miss it, sometimes you never get the correct answer, and although the physical aspects to the game can be fun if you're in the mood for it sometimes you just want to chill and play some trivia not dance around the room or play tug of war.  Finally, their are times where you play ""sudden death"" rounds with your opponent and have to answer questions until you miss.  If you happen to be player one then a big green arrow blocks your view of the question for about 1/4 of your alloted time often leaving you with insufficient time to answer the question.  If you have other trivia games that you like I wouldn't buy this one unless you get tired of the others and if you don't have any trivia games then I suggest YDKJ or Jeopary! first.",3.0

"Don't be fooled by any past claims about this game falling under the title of Survival Horror or being horrific in anyway; despite its name, there is very little horrific about OverBlood. However, just because it doesn't live up to false claims, doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, it's actually quite a good Adventure game and it has some fun moments. It does have a double-edged blade however and while the adventuring and narrative are sharp, at times they're a little too sharp.

For one, you have to use almost everything within your humanly power to avoid dying as every event, enemy and puzzle means your life. The only problem is if you don't know what to do, what items you need or where to go when the crap hits the fan, then you will end up making a quick acquaintance with the Grim Reaper in this game.

One aspect about the game that bugged me was the simple fact that your main nemesis in the game are natural disasters that happen almost randomly. I guess natural disasters isn't the right word as you are accosted by deadly sewer water at one point, but the sheer, unbridled randomness of such encounters gets exasperating after awhile, especially when you have to escape from a crumbling cave on a jet ski (something that Resident Evil 4 unknowingly ripped off and made more infuriating and unnecessary).

The enemies you do encounter in the game are few and far between which breaks up the adventure aspects so you can punch or shoot your way to victory, but there's really no atmosphere or consistency with it and considering it's the only moment in which you have a life bar, it makes the instant death 'you vs. mother nature' aspect unfair in comparison. Plus, finding items in the game is a bit of a secret because most of the pistol clips are actually invisible and are found entirely by just random searching.

The sound effects are pretty generic and otherwise passable. If anything, the monsters you fight make this hilariously stupid mutant cat noise that will make you reach for the mute button after hearing it a second time. The soundtrack is a little mediocre as it's noticeable but not memorable. Sure there was one song early in the game involving long feminine chants that was nice, but nothing else worth writing home about.

The game play is pretty good as controls are responsive and you can usually tell where you need to go most of the time. The graphics aren't half bad either, but like most 3D games it tends to have a silly feel to it, such as when your robot pal Pipo decides to jump up randomly and his robotic body literally squishes itself in order to jump. Also, every time Raz or Mily runs they look like wooden puppets getting their strings being violently pulled on.

The story has its predictable moments, but like the game play/sudden puzzle solving elements, it keeps you guessing while telling you just enough for you to know. What really knocked me off my feet about this game though was the voice acting as it's REALLY good. The only down part is that Raz sounds a little bored sometimes (I understood it when he first woke up, but the entire time?), but that's the only nitpick I can find.

So overall, the game is good. Not fantastic or a magnificent achievement, but enjoyable.",3.0
"I agree the ambience is eerie but that the fog is so thick it becomes very annoying.  My main complaint is the scenes that leave me saying ""what the (...) was that all about?""  Like when you are being chased my 2 ""metalheads,"" and after ricocheting bullets off their masks for three years, they all of a sudden stick their own spears in their throats and continue standing even though they are dead.  In order to get through the door after this, you take eggs out of their hands, yes EGGS, and stick them in the door.  (spoiler) At the end it says ""Some mysteries have been solved and some remain...""  I'm not waiting for all mysteries to be solved, but maybe these scenes could be reconfigured to make more sense than an LSD trip.",3.0

"The previous Company of Heroes expansion, Opposing Fronts, was great because it added entirely new factions, tons of new units and gameplay options.  As far as this expansion goes, there are a couple neat new units you can replace old units with, but not much else as far as that goes.

There are new game types available for multiplayer, but none that are even close to as engaging as your normal matches.

The single-player is alright.  There are a lot more campaigns in this one, though each one is extremely short, even if fairly well done.  I was never one to play Company of Heroes much for the single player campaigns anyway, so this wasn't much of an incentive.

Overall this feels like a hit or miss collections of mods that just about anyone given the right tools could have made just as easily and given out for free.  Pick this up if you find it on sale for really cheap, but don't expect a whole lot of new content.",3.0

"I had to rate this product 3 out of 5 because it really wasn't and isn't all that great. The seller did ship it in a timely fashion and I loved how the packaging came in the box, it was professional air sealed in its own plastic bag.

The controller itself had the activate button on your middle right finger on the back. See they don't show you any pictures of that because it's a bit weird.

I have a few complaints and I hope you'll reconsider buying this product on an impulse based on its pricing. The price is very low compared to others but the preformanxe needs improving.

When you activate the contrle met LED light flashes super fast! I mean almost uncontrollably fast, so having 27 mods is ridiculous and stupid! I play ghosts with it and that's it. The only mods I use is #3,8,11,and 14.

When you try to shut off the mod portion of the controller by following the instructions it says holding the activate button down until the 4th LED light goes out, it's off but that's a lie. You have to hold it down once the light turns off for over 4 sec. If you do it too short it'll cycle it back on and if you hold it too long it'll still cycle back on.

The rapid fire part isn't as fast as my other rapid fire controller I bought from someone else. This is my 3rd rapid controller I've bought and it's the 2nd best I've had. Please consider all the most recent reviews on this product before buying, based on its performance I just know I'll never buy from this seller again.",3.0
The critics are all giving this game very high scores and overlooking its biggest flaw.  The game is extremely difficult at first and has a steep learning curve.  It also has some issues with the controls in the puzzles.  Movement isn't as sharp as it should be and the controls are frustrating at times.  This may discourage many players.  I nearly tossed it in the trash the first couple of hours as its really hard to play.  If you aren't a puzzle person steer clear.  Aside from the difficulty its got a very good story and the voice talents and graphics are top notch. The subject of the story and the conflicts the main character deals with while juggling two women is unique and well told. The games not that long about 8 hours but you will probably play it twice if you get into it to see both endings.  It is unique and will appeal to most male players.  I'd say its a 7.5/10 and another hit for Atlus.,3.0

"*** Update: 1/8/15.  I am demoting this game to 3 from 4 stars.  I am assuming this is a game issue and not a PS4 issue as I have not had this issue with any other PS4 game.  This game has locked up on us twice in the past few weeks when we have been playing it more again after getting some new skylanders for Christmas.  Once was in the middle of a level, and once was in the initial world and trying to return to the main screen.  What is much worse, when we returned to the game after closing it we were greeting with a warning saying our save file is corrupt and would be deleted and we lost all of our progress in the game.  This is just inexcusable and frustrating.  I got onto some blog/forums and see I am not the only one who has had this issue with a lot of people reporting it when trying to use the ""Go to Main Screen"" menu option which I guess I will no longer try to do""  It certainly does not make one want to play the game when you feel like at any moment all of your progress could be lost.  After the second time, I completely deleted all game data (not just the save file) off of the PS4 and I so far it hasn't happened again but who knows.  END OF UPDATE***

I am finding this game to be a bit glitchy.  There are some collision detection issues.  If we leave the PS4 on because we are halfway through a level and don't want to lose our progress, the game is often froze up when we come back.  Sometimes at the main screen there are these visible portals to go into that I don't think are supposed to be there since they go away if you restart and block characters that are talking on the screen.  There are some real issues with some of the bounce pads/air vents/water jets if you are playing with more than one player where the game really gets all kinds of messed up if you aren't exactly together (which can be hard for small kids). The screen will start just jumping around as you go into a cycle of dying and respawning centering on the two characters and it can be hard to break out of.  However, there are also so really cool things in the game.  The voice acting again is great.  Graphics don't seem quite as sharp as Swap Force to me but are still very good.  I like that skystones is back but I like the old version better than this new version.  It seems like they dumbed it down a bit (possibly for smaller kids).  I love the traps and being the villains and the kids really get a kick out of trapping enemies and hearing their voice get ""sucked"" into the trap.  I'm not in love with them introducing yet another element.  It kind of annoys me they couldn't even throw you a bone to make your swappable Swap Force characters or actual Giant's from Giants still do something special, even if it was just a few secret worlds, and that you must have a trap-master to unlock elemental gates. This game has always been a cash grab but it just feels like this iteration is starting to cross the line a bit to me as someone who has been pretty willing to spend money on figures.  I think Activision needs to be careful about making sure the money you've spent continues to be useful in future games and for goodness sake we do not need more elements introduced and GET THE BUGS OUT!!!",3.0

"It was only about $5 more than the standard version when I got it so I thought it was a good deal.

Never played Persona series, but seen it on other platforms and thought it would be fun.

HATE the fact it has dubbed voices. I would have liked original Japanese voices with subtitles since the dialogue is shown anyway so there not even a need for subtitles.

Does have DLC. Charges you money for bunch of characters that should have just been included in the game to begin with. I can understand expansion packs for the likes of WoW, but these DLC for portable game just seems like lazy way for publishers to nickel and dime players.

It lets you play as either Persona 3 or 4 character as the lead. It's basically a dungeon crawler like Atlus's Etrian Odyssey series. Totally unlike the Persona series from what I saw on the interweb.

"I was a Mario fan when I was a child and I really wanted to relive the experience with my children, but this is a poor shadow of the old games. The controls are very flawed. The biggest problem we had with the game is friendly fire. We kept killing each other throwing shells and barrels. Don't get me started on the fact that you can spike your buddy into a hole by accidently jumping at the same time. We would hit another player on the head sending them to their death.

Pros: It forces you to really communicate with the other players in order to pass a level. (Just to put a spin on it).",3.0
"This is a short term review, I've owned these for only 3 days and just want to get my initial thoughts out.  I'll update later if necessary.

If you're like me you've read way to many reviews on these and got a lot of mixed messages so I thought I'd clear the air.

Comfort:
They're not comfortable.  I'm an adult with a medium sized head and they're a tad too big on me after adjusting them to the smallest size.  They are still wearable but not an ideal fit.  They are also a little heavy.  After a few hour or longer gaming sessions I'd have to take them off for periods.

The Sound:
I currently have a Bose 5.1 setup.  (those mini double speakers) These sound about the same as it.  If you're using your tv speakers you'll be blown away but if you already have a good sound system don't expect much.  Though I was geeking out when I plugged them into my PC and got to hear the difference between my stereo 10 year old harmon/kardon's and these.  I do wish these headphones had more base.  They have a little but they are certainly not as good as the beats by dre headphones I've tried out.  Also one little tid bit, the high pitch sounds come in almost too loud.  On one of the songs I listened to anytime they pronounced an S word the S sound was almost painful.  Maybe good for footsteps but not music.  One thing I'll give these headphones over my 5.1 setup is you can place sounds extremely well.  In Bf3 I got a nice extra kill hearing someone behind me.

Also someone mentioned a .2 sec or something delay in the sound - the sound comes out at the exact same time as my regular speakers so ignore that.
Current setup, HDMI to receiver for my home sound, then the separate dongle with optical out (xbox 360) into the XP500 for headphones sound.  You can have both on at once.

Batteries:
They eat your controller batteries (xbox 360) if you do the wireless chat as well as having a demand on the headphone batteries.  You plug a blue tooth thing into the controller which lets you talk via xbox live and it eats up your controller batteries.  The headset also takes 2 double A batteries.  I ordered a wired talkback cable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turtlebeach-X31-X41-X11-PX21-PX5-XP400-XP500-Xbox-Live-Talkback-Cable-Puck-Black-TB450-2181-01-Official-Replacement-Cable-NEW/dp/B008BVUOBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turtlebeach X31/X41/X11/PX21/PX5/XP400/XP500 Xbox Live Talkback Cable Puck Black (TB450-2181-01) Official Replacement Cable NEW</a>&nbsp;to try and help with the battery thing.  I'll update if it helps.  As soon as you unplug the blue tooth the controller low battery indicator goes away.  Rechargeable batteries don't keep as much juice as fresh new batteries and mine were just not lasting at all... Update: the talkback cable preserves your controller batteries pretty well.  Use it instead of the Bluetooth.

Wireless Interference?:
I have Verizon Fios and their wireless router with my wifi PC, wireless mouse and keyboard and they all work just fine with the headset in use.  THOUGH, if I walk to the other side of the room the headset will start picking up static.  Also a funny little bit, if I connect my phone to the wifi and start browsing pages on my phone, the headset will pick up static each time a new page loads.  So I guess it depends on what you have for wifi in your house.

Setup:
I felt it was kind of limited.  You have to use Optical cable to the wireless transmitter for surround sound.  It has an Optical in and an Optical out.  It also has the old Red and White in for stereo sound.  I believe you can hook your headphones up wired if you get a toslink to toslink optical cable (or you can buy adapters)  It looks like headphone cable end except it has an optical tip.  That's how I setup my PC to use its sound.  I have an iMac and all apple pc headphone jacks double as toslink optical cable outputs.  (I'm not an apple buff, I'm currently running windows on this thing, just had to mention)
And of course for power there's a usb to transmitter wire.

Oh and you can only have one wireless headset hooked up, you can do another wired but one is the max for wireless on the transmitter.  Max 2, one wired, one wireless.

Oh, I did fail to mention it has blue tooth so you can connect it with your phone and play music on it that way.  Pretty cool.  Hold the blue tooth button down on the headset when turning on blue tooth mode and it should say blue tooth pairing (or turn it off first).  Then look for it on your phone.  It uses the chat (blue tooth) volume control, not the main one.

Programmable:
Don't care, haven't tried.  Btw presets are just bad.

I was thinking about returning them but I'll probably just hold on to them.  I mean they work so why not, can't say I'd recommend them to anyone though.  If you just want to spoil yourself and don't care about the money then maybe.  That's where I was when I bought them.  :)  But don't expect them to redefine sound for you if you already have a good speaker setup.",3.0
"I hate how Ace Combat changed itself in this game. I loved 4, 5, and 0, but this game feels like they've lost the focus on gameplay and are trying to wow you with gimmicks.",3.0
"Sonic Unleashed is the first 3d sonic game I have purchased since the Dreamcast days and its a pretty good game that does somethings right and well to be blunt a few things went the wrong direction. The story is pure stupid. A little kid might find more value in the story than I did. The only plus to the story is the cutscenes do look good.

Graphically I think the game looks good enough but I think the Wii can handle a little bit of an effort. I will give this game the benefit of saying the character models do look good. As far as sound goes there is nothing really wrong with it but the voice acting did get on my nerves a bit. Again if I was a little kid the voice acting probably would not have bothered me as much. The interface is pretty basic but it is designed nice enough to get the job done.

Gameplay wise the day levels are nothing short of the word great. Where the game falls into mediocrity is the Wherehog levels. They are not terrible levels but there are way too many of them. I have been playing with the classic controller so the controls do work pretty good and you get a few different options including Gamecube controllers as well. I think if the game had more day levels and maybe half the amount of Wherehog levels this game could of been great.",3.0

"So a little back ground I've played and beaten Diablo, Diablo 2 and the Lord of Destruction expansion pack. I grew up playing this franchise and really really love it.

Lets talk about the characters. So far I have two builds a monk and a witch doctor. Completed the normal modes and have been dipping my toes into the online. The characters are all rather unique except for the barbarian which I find is just a typical murder tank not much excitement there. The witch doctor is cool summon some dudes than stand back and blow them apart with magic. The monk was harder for me didn't really like her until the end the second act then she really started to come into her own.

The story line is kinda bonk. They totally scrap the first game and how that all went down. I didn't find myself caring about the main  characters I ended caring most about two of the warriors you recruit the scoundrel and the Templar and covetous Shen who really deserves his own DLC.

The cut scenes are beautiful there is one where you see this detail of Leah's hand and I was really impressed by that. Diablo on the other hand looks wrong almost feminine I was hoping for an old school HD version but hey. The end seemed rushed the Belial boss battle was awful and its a tad on the easy side even with playing the second time through the hard style of normal mode.

The cool thing is on the second play through the characters share that chest thing so you can leave your weaker player goodies. But you also get access to all your gold so you can really mod your new build out with the best which is nice.

It wasn't bad it just didn't have the same wonder that 2 had. I dunno.",3.0
"i love the lego franchise but i really feel that they could've done more with this game. individual powers are relatively limited (especially compared to lego batman), and you pretty much figure everything out within the first 30 minutes or so of the gameplay...then it started getting very repetitive.  i think the whole indiana jones theme had a lot of potential but just didn't live up to the expectations. also, the very last level of the game is sort of ""ruined"" by the obviousness... especially if you watched the indiana jones movies.",3.0
"Whn I bought this game I thought we were going to be in different cities, but just one city makes it boring. Good graphics and bad plot. Why not put Brooke Burke instead of draws of her? You can find plenty of cars and that's great, design them and make changes, challenge other drivers and make slips. But after some minutes you get tired because it's almost the same every time you play.",3.0
"I wanted to buy Blinx just because of what I've seen and heard in reviews.  The game is fun but a little tough at times and it does get a bit frustrating.  I haven't been playing it as much as I thought I would.  Honestly, either rent it from the video store or buy it on ebay.. don't pay full price for this game.",3.0
This game was kind of disappointing. I am not sure if it was the story line or the characters themselves that did or did not do it for me. Aside from the beautiful cut scenes and graphics this game left me feeling sort of aching to play a good rpg. Which is sad because this is a Final Fantasy game and I should not feel like that after having playing it.,3.0
"While this series has advanced some, I can't get over how similar 2008's version is to even 1998's game.  This season the live game action is better, but you STILL have no control over baserunners.  Sometimes your fastest runner won't try to score from 3rd with two outs on a single.  The user should be able to decide whether he risks it or not.  The free agency system is still out-dated and no other teams really bother competing for star players during the off-season.  Basically if you're willing to pay the player's demands, you can easily build an allstar team within one year.  Some may say this is realistic, but there still needs to be some competition for star quality players.  They should have bidding wars where other teams drive up the price at the last minute and sometimes actually steal a player away from you.

If you really want to exploit the game's weaknesses, just control a very low budget team like the Royals or Nationals for one season.  You will ALWAYS make a profit so you can triple your payroll the following year and build an allstar team.  This is silly as any baseball fan knows the Royals and other low budget teams would never triple their payroll in one year, and can rarely if ever sign big name players.  It's kind of a fun game to play one season in, but over multiple years it's laughably simple to have a lineup consisting of eight superstars and a a starting rotation of all Cy Young winners.  Maybe the online leagues are better for live competition but who knows.....",3.0
"I downloaded this last night onto my PS3 from the PS Store, so keep this in mind when I'm reviewing this.  Btw, download time is ridiculously fast, like 5 minutes to download, so you won't have to wait long to play :)

Anyways, I beat this in just a little bit over 6 hours.  I am a pretty hardcore AC fan - played all of the games, attempting to speed run AC3, so here is my perspective:

1. This game is pretty short.  From what I count there are only 9 sequences and these sequences blaze by really fast.  Sequence 8 is really short too (sequence where you meet Connor).

2. The fighting in this game is pretty smooth and easy to learn.  It's almost identical to AC3 with the exception of menuing and stuff.  Because this is a VITA import you won't get the same sort of freedom when fighting or exploring like you do with, say, AC3 or Black Flag.  However, with that said, most of the battles are ridiculously easy...no real challenge when fighting enemies.

3. Storyline wise, it's extremely confusing.  You get to play certain sections of her life, and then the animus skips head to another section of her life, and while that section is loading up the animus will display some text explaining a little bit of what's going on.  It makes the storyline hard to follow.  Also, not a lot of chemistry between many of the characters; most of the time the dialogue is very stilted.  It's not confusing to the point that you don't know what you're doing, though, as the game always provides hints and directions to help you move on to your next task.  Convenient.  I played this while I had the flu so it helped lol.

4. Aveline as a character...is awesome.  I'm REALLY happy that when Ubisoft created this character, they didn't attempt to ""sexualize"" her or make her wear any ridiculous boob armor.  Instead, they gave her a very practical Assassin's outfit, didn't make her weak by any means, but at the same time didn't downplay her femininity.  Even when she's in dress, she uses her charm as an Assassin tactic which I found interesting.  What I found interesting was the interactions she'd get from other people depending on how she dressed - like if she is a slave, she gains notoriety really quickly just even if she's running around.  But dressed ""as a lady"" she gains it more slowly and you can sometimes see guys taking a good look at her if you get my drift...

5. Exploration in this game...does not exist.  If you're expecting it to be like AC3, where you have this huge frontier to explore, you will be sorely disappointed.  AC: Liberation has a big swamp in place of the sprwaling frontier, but it's devoid of any animals (I only ran into a raccoon and a few alligators), it's not really explorable aside from collecting various side items (like letters or treasure chests), and you mainly use it to get to quest areas.  In the city, there's hardly anything to explore either.  You pretty much only stay in the city or the bayou during the entire game, with the exception of sequence 8, where you get to go to the snowy frontier while questing with Connor.

6. THE GLITCHES. OH MY.  Within the first 5 minutes of playing Liberation, I ran into one of the most horrific glitches.  Something went wrong when the left side of Aveline's face rendered...causing one of her eyeballs to just float there and the rest of her face had expanded and exploded across the screen, rendering me unable to see where I was going.  I had to restart a new game because of this glitch.  So, so bad.  I've also had random instances when the game would just randomly just freeze up on me.  I haven't run into some of the other glitches other players have been running into, thank the baby Jesus, but these glitches..just...why.  Ubisoft, this is just sloppy work.  And I thought the glitches in AC3 were bad...

7. Graphics wise, I don't have much to complain about.  Now if you're expecting it to look as detailed as AC3, don't hold your breath - it's a VITA import - and although they're tried to ""update"" the graphics keep in mind it's not going to be super detailed.  But I don't really mind at all.  Reminds me of how an AC game would look on a PS2.

8. Connor continues to be socially awkward in sequence 8 but not as grumpy as usual.  Probably because he gets to interact with the only girl he's ever met? lmao. Like the only other woman he ever interacted with in AC3 was his own mother. IDK why you people are shipping Aveline and Connor though, clearly Gerald has a thing for her ;) Gerald will probably forever be friend-zoned tho...

9. Also, if anyone's wondering--there is really no replay value to this.  Also, when you finish the game there really isn't anything to do.  I think this game was a touch shorter than the AC3 DLC, so yeah...pretty fast to play (and it's really easy too).  Something fun to play during a weekend if you have some time to spare.  Or if you're sick, like moi.

Overall, I liked the game, but I wish the story was developed more and Ubisoft started making games that weren't full of WTF glitches.  I really would love for Ubisoft to develop a full, proper AC Title featuring her, because I think she would make a really awesome leading assassin.  Do I smell sequel perhaps...",3.0

I like the way these hand grips feel as they are comfortable but the biggest negative is that you can only use them when running the internal battery only.

"Wow...  What a polarizing game this is to play.  I guess to sum it up quickly, if you're a fan of the Demon's Souls/Dark Souls series AND the Darksiders series, then you may find something of some pretty decent value here.  If you wanted to like the Souls series but just couldn't for various reasons, this may be for you as well.  If you never played them and loved Darksiders, you will enjoy this (probably).

The real grit on this.  I found this game to be just okay.  I am a big Souls series fan and Darksiders was okay... It was entertaining but the second one was longwinded and got tedious after a while for me personally. Lords of the Fallen is an amalgam of both of these series.  However, it doesn't really do any of them justice other than sort of looking the part.  For all the brutal difficulty you can find in the Souls games, it is lacking here and masked with the appearance of a difficult game.  The bosses are very easy and the difficulty level is very strange as the game goes on.  On the Darksiders side of things, it looks a lot like those games in terms of color pallette and character design. The game is also much lighter in tone than the Souls series which also echoes Darksiders.

Now similarities to other games aside, it's a very pretty experience.  The game looks great and (mostly) plays fluidly.  The bad points are frequent game crashes (PS4), horrible voice acting, ultra thin and boring/confusing narrative and unbalanced difficulty.  Inexplicable game crashes were annoying but typically, a reboot fixed the problem and not much profess is lost.  The voice acting is few and far between so no, not a huge deal breaker either.  The story is a problem... You know basically what's going n sort of... but don't really understand why you are doing it other than to redeem yourself? eh...  The path you are set on is straight forward in the beginning of the game but then becomes exceedingly convoluted.  Back tracking through places you would never think to backtrack towards then, it all becomes straightforward again.  The difficulty is not a challenge until the last third.  Wherein, you are fighting a bunch of human characters that prove to be much more difficult than any challenge you have faced thus far (including bosses).  This was strange... The last boss is perhaps the most frustrating.  Where the entire game up to this point has at least managed to be consistent, thesis where everything breaks.  The last battle is marred with a bunch of cheesy tactics that make the game frustrating.  Not only is it nonsensical, but you will find the only way to survive is to exploit the environment, or run around like a moron until you fell this boring and uninspired character.

All in all, it's okay.  If you are wanting something to hold you over until Bloodborne or Scholar of the First Sin, you may find it's okay but nothing more.  If you are wanting Darksiders III and feeling you may never get it, than this may help you in a lot of ways.  If you are looking for an in depth RPG game with a great challenge and story, no.. you are just going to get something pretty to look at here.

There are interesting concepts within this game.  The XP system is unique and the fighting can be fun sometimes, it's just taking too many cues from other things and not gelling them together in a cohesive way to make it a fun experience.",3.0
"There have been mixed reviews for this game and all of them have a valid point. In my case, my review is based in the fact that the game failed to achieve what I considered important: a decent sequel storyline and improve the feel that the original game became famous about. I believe that you'll either agree or disagree with me depending on whether or not you played Resistance: Fall of Men before.

It is a good game, don't get me wrong. The graphics are superb, sound effects are great as usual, and overall, the single player campaign will keep you busy for a while. If this is the first time you pick up the game (I mean, without trying the first installment) you won't be disappointed and you'll be happy to see what the PS3 system can do once programmers are getting used to it. As noted in other posts, you will find great similarities with COD4 due to the fact that the gameplay is very similar (e.g. weapons carried, how you move through a level, damage and regeneration). Here is where most of reviewers will give it 5 stars, and I agree to some extent.

However, these are also the characteristics that disappointed me. RFoM had a good, interesting storyline, it was enjoyable to play, split screen co-op, and didn't feel so arcadedish. In this game you are extremely limited in terms of movement, the paths are too obvious, intel is always easy to gather, you always end up having enough ammo and the right guns to defeat bosses. Perhaps I was expecting more challenging gameplay.

Regarding the storyline, the game manages to loose all of its suspense and interest the very moment it unveils the oncoming plot. It feels like there is no connection with the first game whatsoever, and voice acting is decent at best.

As far as the multiplayer goes, I'm still debating whether I like it or not. I have to admit, the idea of playing with 60 people is great, but it seems unorganized and the maps are not exactly designed for such massive gameplay. It's a great concept though, that I'm sure it will be polished in time. In the end though, I just don't feel like picking up the game and play like I did with the original Resistance.

Bottom-line? Good game if you're a first-timer, but as far as I'm concerned, they totally lost the essence of the original, hence, 3 stars.

And yes, I'm keeping my old game I love so much and selling this one.",3.0

"The gameplay is by far the most aggressive out of the entire Metroid series.  You don't get a chance to do the dodges or grab an enemy to shoot a fully charged beam into its mouth or tear off the wings of a fly.  It does remind you of playing Super Metroid with the items that you have.  My biggest gripe is that you have all the items, but you have to get your butt whooped a couple of times before you are authorized to use it.  The way you shoot the missile is a pain in the butt.  The story line leaves too much open.  I'll try not to ruin anything.  You'll notice that when she goes into her past that she is the only one in the Chozo power suit and not in the trooper power suit.  What does Other M stand for?  Then when you fully beat the game with everything collected, you'll probably go ""Is that it?!""  The game did draw my attention with the graphics and the amount of detail placed in the game.  If they were trying to close the gap between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion, that's fine.  Although they need to put a little focus on a story after Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime since those that have played it are probably like me, ""What's going to happen next?""  Hope Nintendo will fix their mess and give the players what they really want.",3.0
"First off, I am a big Assassins Creed fan. I especially loved the Ezio franchise due to the story, the awesome gameplay, and the fact that Ezio himself was such a bada$$. I beat all of the Ezio games within a week because I was so eager to finish the story.

Then, AC3 came out. I was very excited to continue the story. However, I was disappointed and here is why:
-Connor is boring. I'm sorry to put it so bluntly, but it is the truth. He bores me. There is nothing exciting about him at all. When it came to Ezio, he at least made me feel like a true Assassin. With Connor, however, I just don't get that same feeling because his character is so dull.
-There is too much running around! I swear, I can't tell you how many times I had to literally run, and run, and run some more to get from point A to point B. You are slowed down by so many things too, such as a mountain range. I will be running in a straight line, but then bam there is a mountain in my way and I have to figure out a way around it.
-Too many cut scenes. I enjoy cut scenes, but not when they are as excessive as this game is. I feel like I'm watching a movie with the amount of heavy cut scenes they added to this game.
-The story is on the dull side. I get bored to the point where I stop paying attention anymore.
-I feel as though all I do is fight those guards at times. It's fun at first, but it loses it's appeal quickly. You can only fight so many guards before it gets repetative and therefore boring. The older games, such as AC2, were not anywhere near this bad when it came to the guards. The guards chased you down in the older games, but it was not as excessive as AC3 is.
-Most importantly, this is the FIRST AC game that I put down and have yet to finish. I do plan to finish it one of these days for the sake of the story line, but the game is just such a big disappointment that I can't pick up the controller just yet. In time I will, but I need a break from this terrible game.

It saddens me to leave a bad review. I gave it 3 stars only because it is an AC game and it is fun to a very small extent. I do like to know what happens in the story too. Other than that though, it's just not a super fun game like the others before it.",3.0

"I loved the gamed until after you finish with normal mode other modes like nightmare to inferno are just exactly the same thing as you did in normal but harder. The other problem is that this game has no offline mode, just have to be connected to the internet to play the game. Lastly, there is no real pvp update made the extendability of the game dead. If your a fan of d2 you won't be disappointed in the storyline or the gameplay, but there is no real end game just repetitive gameplay till you get bored. If you do buy the game always play the barbarian!! OP class and can make it easier for you to level other toons or transfer items from your main.

"The Games are pretty decent, playng in the casual mode, There is still some difficulty as the game is no that easy. For one thing, as the title indicates, Drawings are a major part of the game and you personally need to complete some of the Drawings. The drawings are connect the Dots type of drawings but you do need to be able to maneuver the mouse around to some semblance of the Picture. There is no skip for this feature.

There is a Hint but it is not always clear nor is there a Map to let you know where you are or where you want to go.

"You can get lost in Prey. Literally.

There's so many things to do in Prey, it is a great time sink, but also a frustrating and occasionally confusing odyssey.  There's NOTHING here to link Prey with the 2006 game other than the fact you encounter aliens, in some form. The story is vague and but also vaguely interesting.  Influence range from the obvious Bioshock/System Shock nods to Dead Space all made by the company who brought you Dishonored.

I would say the number one game Prey reminds me of is Jurassic Park from the SNES. In Prey and Jurassic Park, you are alone among brutal bullet sponge enemies while looking for key cards and attempting to escape with almost no help.  Both games are incredibly unforgiving but both are also satisfying when you finally find success.  Equally, both games are not for everybody and arguably very unbalanced.

Prey at its best, is a wonderful, brutal survival sandbox awaiting exploration and experimentation.  At its worst, Prey is a meandering, punishing and hollow maze that has no true focus. It's almost like a Dishonored 3 prototype set in space with crap first person shooting.  If all I can do here is compare it to other games, it's precisely because the game is so hard to explain on its own terms. There's something remarkable about how opaque a great deal of the game is and I'm glad the experience is no cake-walk.  But the story isn't very good, the controls feel mushy and the enemies are so overpowered at times, you may wonder what the reward really could be for pushing to the end, which, by the time you see it, is about as half-axed as the one in the SNES Jurassic Park game.

I really want to love Prey and at some points of the game, you will too. But this is no Dishonored.  Prey has no shortage of things to do, but it's just not fun to do most of them. Prey is like a really hard version of Portal 2.  But but not as fun and not as funny.",3.0
"First off this game isn't anythang like the last two .

The whole cops thang is okay, though cops have like armored tires..lol The story line is tight, reminds of the first Fast & The Furious .

"The only thing shocking about Bioshock is the undue praise it gets.
What is essentially an FPS with a passable array of weaponry and mildly useful superpowers is coated with very dark and moody, yet colorful graphics... then seasoned with a light dusting of bargain brand macabre story... and voila! You have Bioshock.
There was a lot left for wanting in this game.

The control was a little loose and switching from powers to weaponry could have been smoother. It feels very much like a PC game meant to be played with more precise and flexible controls. Enemies dart around very quickly, and unless you're the Flash on the analog sticks, you're going to endure a little frustration. A sharp FPS experience is easily marred when burdened by console controllers if no corrective measures are taken to tone it down half a notch. At the least more customizable analog options could have been included, such as acceleration, which makes a huge difference. When it comes to FPS, poor control options like that are a bad decision.

The graphics and physics were nice, although I'm a little tired of games intentionally being excessively dark in order to convey that angsty, brooding atmosphere. There was a lot of neon, which I suppose contrasts with the inky blackness to provide light and shadow and impress all the eye-candy addicts. For me, the style was a swing and a miss. I've seen better atmosphere and artistry in a plethora of other FPS games. That old 50s style imagery that reminded me very much of Fallout, but is not intended to be campy in the least. It is intended to reflect the era in which Rapture evolved, but again a swing and a miss for me.

Plasmid powers are a nice gimmick, but aren't as useful to gameplay as I thought they would be. There are 9 powers (some with different levels), but since many are weaker or not as useful as others, you end up using 2 or 3 the majority of the game. Most are simply attack abilities anyways, which are easily replaced with a big gun. Combine this all with sometimes outrageous EVE (plasmid fuel) power usage. Psi Ops did the ""plasmid"" thing a long time ago and did it better.
You can always turn to your weapons.

Weapons. 6. Only 6. For an FPS these days, that is pathetic. You can upgrade them, but they are for the most part the same weapon. Sad. I might as well go back to those plasmid powers... at least they are prettier.

Hacking. OK, so Bioshock is very obviously trying to be the next System Shock. Unfortunately hacking in Bioshock is simply a game of Pipe Dreams. If you don't like that, you can buy insta-hack items, which use up some useless cash and make hacking kind of a moot point. Another swing and a miss...

Inventions. A nice little time waster. Having to find machines scattered around where you can do it is annoying. This is no Dark Cloud or any other game where inventing/combining items is exciting and fruitful.
Tonics were a great part of the game and allowed the most customizability to your gameplay experience. This was singlehandedly the best thing Bioshock had to offer.
Research added a bit of spice to gameplay as well. Studying your enemies and getting to know more about them in order to more effectively deal with them was great. Unfortunately most of the time this resulted in just a damage bonus, but in the case of teleporting enemies, where you were suddenly able to see where they were moving, this mechanic added to the experience in a more satisfying way. I would have liked to have seen better enemy variety though. Most were just the same enemy type with a different weapon.

Now mash all of this together and cover it with a story of evil and mayhem and ... blah blah. I didn't buy into it. At all. Since the main character offers nothing in terms of reactions, I felt no connection to him, the story or the game. It all just felt lifeless. It is also mainly delivered through radio chatter, which is so impersonal and boring.

You can replay it to see the ending you missed (there are only 2), but aside from a few yes/no type choices, the gameplay will be the exact same. To me, that's not replayability... that's reiteration, which is not the samee.",3.0

"- Huge fan of the modern warfare games on Xbox 360 w countless hours of time logged on multiplayer
- Ghosts is a decent game, it's similar to what the previous versions have been but with a different system for unlocking weapons and perks, streaks etc.
- Graphics are what really surprised me. They are no better than 360 in any way shape or form on this specific title. I expected this game to show off the power of the next gen console but I think the fact that it was created to run on the previous gen might have something to do with it. I have a feeling the next call of duty game is gonna be the one...this seems like a quick game to add to some excitement of the new systems.
- If you are a serious modern warfare gamer then why not pick this up, but if you think it's going to really show off the new generation of gaming console I think you may disappointed.
- I'd recommend checking out game play on YouTube to really get in depth info on how the game works. If you like the sort of new system to it, then you can decide better if you wanna spend the money.
Good luck and enjoy!",3.0
"Okay. So this is an excellent headset to use for the xbox 360 and ps3. When you purchase it it comes with all of the cables needed to hook it up to your xbox 360 controller (haven't used it for the ps3. I do have a ps3 but don't use ps3 for gaming, just for the blu-ray player and playing dvds).

I've had it almost a year and a half. here is one of my huge problems with it.
It is very, very fragile. When taking it off your head treat it like it is an expensive piece of hardware, because it is.
When I took it off a few weeks ago the swivel to the earbud broke inside the frame. ***It's designed to break***, so you have to either repair it yourself (very carefully, but easily fixed, so you don't pinch the wire) or buy a new headset (about $70, ERV).
Sadly it is not covered under the warranty, since I do not have the receipt, and it was gifted to me by a relative.
The fix is provided below. You are either going to fix it or buy a new one anyway. So try it if you want to try to salvage your headset. There are videos on how to fix the headphones too on youtube but the video's contributors have long since left the videos dead so don't count on getting any help from turtlebeach about these unless they're still under warranty.

My recommendation: Buy it, if you're tired of buying those crappy $15 microsoft headsets. Good investment, and a good gift for this upcoming christmas / black friday at best buy.
You are heard very well in the mic, and it cuts off background noise when you are wearing these.

To fix: You need a piece of metal about 2 inches long, a quarter inch thick, which can be easily bent to the conform of the headset.
You also need two small screws, and washers to match (I would get about 2 washers per screw, to distance the screw enough so it doesn't pinch the wire, but enough so it will ""bite"" into the headset).

"There seems to be a trend as of late to create Xbox 360 first person shooters that involve team-mates.

I played Army of two about a month ago, and I really enjoyed it. So, I decided to give Conflict: Denied ops a whirl as well.

What I got for my money was just an average offering. There wasn't all that much that really stuck out in my mind about the game, with one exception, which I'll get to later.

Don't get me wrong, it was fun, and I think it was worth playing.

The game is about two CIA operatives, one named Lincoln Graves, a former marine sniper, and his partner, Reggie Lang.  The game revolves around you controlling one or the other in ten different missions, each one taking you to a different location across the globe, but all being interconnected.

Graves is a sniper, and is best to use if you need stealth, while Lang is big, muscular, and uses a machine gun. Not good for subtleness, but when you need a heavy hitter, he's your man.

Ok, the game play itself. I've said this before in several of my previous reviews about the way first person shooters are portrayed with the 360. You don't have a health meter, or an armour meter for that matter. The more damage you take, the screen becomes blurred and tinged red. The worse this becomes, the closer you are to dying.

And, as I've said numerous times, when that happens, get your rear to cover. But, there is a difference this time around. A very important difference!  If you're taken down, you can switch over to control your partner and get him to come up to you and heal you.

Of course, if he gets taken down, that's all she wrote. You'll have to reload from the last checkpoint.

One thing I need to point out though - you should keep some space between yourself and your partner. There are a few areas that if you're both together, one hit and its game over man, game over! The upside is that you have three minutes to get to your partner once he's down. If you can't do it in that time, your partner dies, and the mission ends. Time to reload from a previous check point.

Switching control is a simple pull of the button, and you have only three basic commands to give to your partner. Stay with me, go to a specific location, or stay put. Use em wisely!

You really don't have much of a variety of weapons to use in the game. You start out with a handgun and a sniper rifle. As you progress the missions, you get automatic upgrades for your weapons, such as a grenade launcher for Lang, and an under barrel shotgun for Graves.

One important feature to point out is that you can never run out of ammunition, so if you want to, spray it, don't say it!  However, that being said, you can run out of explosives such as grenades and mines.

But, that's not even a huge issue, as you will find places in each mission that you can restock on explosives - not only your grenades, but for the grenade launcher and the rocket launcher as well.

Your missions, as I stated above, really do take you around the globe. You start out in a small South American country (Sorry, I can't remember the name off the top of my head), in the middle of a civil war. From there you have nine more missions, which take you to a monastery, a diamond mine, the Arctic Circle, an oil refinery, a lumber mill, a submarine pen, an oil tanker on the high seas and a military base. I know that I'm missing one, so forgive me, I completed the game a week before I started to write this review.

So, you have no shortage of exotic locations to visit.

A couple of the missions do involve stealth, so I'd suggest using Graves to start and have him find the best path to take. Control Lang after you have Graves in place, don't get him to auto-follow. I don't know if it would work or not, but I felt safer controlling him on my own.

And, the stealthier you are, the easier time you'll have of it. Once you're cover is blown, the enemy will be all over you like white on rice.

There are several times during the game that you'll be given the chance to control a vehicle. You can drive a tank, hovercraft and an APC. The controls weren't the best, I found them annoying to use. One control stick controlled the direction your vehicle traveled, the other aiming your weapons. If you're not careful, you could find yourself driving backwards while firing when you wanted to go sideways or even forward.

That is one issue I've had with many of the games I've played. The programmers really need to come up with a better control system for vehicle operation.

As for the music, there really wasn't anything that jumped out and struck me as being really good. Not like Frontlines: Fuel of war. Still, it was well done, and in the background, not overbearing at all.

I have played games in the past in which the background music was so loud that I missed some of the dialogue that took place during the cut scenes. That wasn't the case with this game.

The graphics were your typical Xbox 360 graphics. Crisp, well defined, easy to watch. I didn't see any issues with enemy targets getting stuck inside other objects like I've seen with a few of the more recent games I've played.

Although, there were a couple of occasions where, when one of the characters I was controlling got taken down that his gun would be lost inside the ground, or stuck in a wall or the like.

But these were minor, and they didn't affect the game play in any way, shape or form.

The cut scenes were brief, and did help propel the storyline forward, and most of these scenes involved Graves and Lang. To be honest, I found Graves living up to his nickname during the game. The character wasn't really likeable at all, unlike, in my personal view, Lang.

You can judge that on your own, after all, my opinion is just that, mine. If people agree with it, great, if they don't, no big deal either.

Since I brought up the enemies earlier, I should mention the AI controlling them. They don't stand around. They move from cover to cover, they will attempt to flank you. If you stay in one place, watch out for grenades being tossed in your direction.

Again, also, if you stay in one place for too long, the enemy will more often than not try to come and flush you out, or get to a better position in order to make short work of you and your partner. Movement around the maps is key for survival.

Speaking of maps, some of the maps you play on are huge! There are many twists and turns, and it would be a good idea to explore every nook and cranny as quite often they will contain enemy soldiers that, once you've taken care of a group of them and you think your safe, one could come up and end your game real fast. Besides, doing that will help you find more places you can restock your explosives as well.

Another thing that really caught my interest was the destroyable environment. You could wreak as much havoc as you wished, tons of things, including many buildings, were completely destructible. In fact, you can even gain an achievement for destroying your environment.

Lastly, I didn't bother trying any of the multiplayer functions in the game. I'm a solo player and don't really gain any enjoyment from trying these games online with strangers.

In conclusion, as I stated at the beginning of the review, the game wasn't bad. It was fun, and the story kept me interested, even though it was a little confusing at times - why the team happened to be going to one specific location, what it had to do with the overall arc, that sort of thing.

Now, I mentioned one thing that really stuck out in my mind at the beginning of the review... it didn't take me five or six hours to beat the game! All in all, I played it for almost 11 hours in total.

I hate how short most games are today! This was refreshing.

Pros
- Length of the game. Ten missions.
- Destructible environment
- Smart enemy AI.
- Lots of exotic locations and huge maps to play on.

Cons
- If you don't complete a mission, when you play again, you have to start over from the beginning of that particular mission.
- Some of the levels had a serious frustration factor involved. A few extra check points would have been appreciated.
- Poor vehicle controls.

"Although I didn't think this game was totally awful I was definitely disappointed. The ability to have two players is great. But the graphics were average or less and the entire game took a friend and I only about 6 hours to finish! The cut scenes were nice but the gameplay was fairly repetitive and obvious. Even though they say you can ""choose your own path"" what that seems to boil down to is going around the rock on the left or right side. The game is still very linear. So rent it, beat it in a night or two and then you won't feel the need to ever play it again.",3.0
ok,3.0
"If you like to play linear games or if you're just starting to play PC games and you don't want to wander around for ages, this game is PERFECT for you.  In Murder on the Orient Express, you are playing as Antoinette Marceau, an employee of the eponymous train line who assists Hercule Poirot in solving a murder that takes place on the train.

Basically, the game walks you through every step and always points you to what you need to do next--for example, when you need to collect fingerprints from all the suspects, you automatically ask people for them as soon as you pick up the items you need (the first time it happened, I was startled).  Sometimes I got frustrated by the illogical actions, but I never needed a walkthrough...and I am usually queen of the walkthroughs. The ending is like an interactive movie, where Poirot reveals the three solutions and prompts Antoinette (you) for her deductions.

I was somewhat disappointed in the graphics--movements were crude and I had a lot of trouble with bugs and crashes.  On the other hand, David Suchet is the voice of Poirot, and that makes up for a lot.

Bottom line: the game is 1-2 stars if you like nonlinear games or really sophisticated gameplay.  It's 4 stars if you like playing linear games and/or want a game that will keep you on track.",3.0
"This review was written by James Shea, my son.

The sequel to True Crime: Streets of LA, ""True Crime New York City"" takes the main idea of Grand Theft Auto and changes some key element; for example, the main character is a cop, rather than a criminal, and the game takes place in a map that is based on the actual NYC.

The general story follows an ex-gang member who joins up with the NYPD to follow in the footsteps of a family friend, and simultaneously tries to escape the influence of his crime-lord father. The story progresses to involve corrupt police, gang members, and the mafia. Like ""Streets of LA"", the player can choose to be a good cop (arresting suspects, using non-lethal blows, turning in evidence) or a bad cop (killing suspects, pawning evidence, and generally being corrupt). This leads to two different endings, but not as many branches as in Streets of LA.

The gameplay elements are fairly diverse. The controls, to start, are absolutely terrible. They're complicated, they don't handle well, and oftentimes they don't go where they're supposed to. The range of activities, and how the player deals with a given scenario, is extensive. There are many random crimes comitted across the city to deal with, ranging from a stolen car on the loose to a gang showdown to an assault and battery. There are many ways to deal with these problems. A good cop dealing with a sidewalk full of gang members has to flash his badge or fire some warning shots before they'll cooperate; a bad cop can simply run them all over with his car. Good cops need to only arrest legitimate criminals; bad cops can plant evidence to boost their reputation for getting an arrest. However, due to the bad controls, sometimes good cops may slip up and accidentally break a neck or some other unapproved act. This limits the full potential of the game. At the same time, civilians aren't entirely helpless, either. Frisk the wrong guy for drugs and he might just decide to pull a taser or a handgun. However, in a lot of regards there is no penalty (besides a bad cop rating) for running over civilians or your fellow officers.

The graphics are decent to good, and the sound has lots of good licensed music. However, the main issue in the game is the lack of crowds. Considering that the game takes place in NYC, the entire city should be jam-packed, but due to the software and hardware limits there are only four or five people on a sidewalk generally. This makes the game feel like it's more ambitious than it can afford.

As a whole, this game isn't terribly good; despite a lot of neat attempts, the game ultimately falls short due to a wide variety of technical shortcomings. It just seems like it's trying too hard to be GTA, and this makes it lose a lot of the little things that it had going for it.

"At first I put in shift with every intention of not likely it, but several hours later I found myself firing the game back with different intention... to have an adrenaline fueled excitement race behind the wheel! Many months ago, I was just another nay saver, posting negative comments about the series shifting in the wrong direction. It's definitely fair now to retract my previous statement, as I always seem to do with this series (Refer to my review on Pro Street). They did a wonderful job transforming an arcade series into a full pledged simulated racer.

I've played every single racer that has been released on the next-gen consoles, and I can't even count how many dating back to last generation. In my honest opinion, Need for Speed Shift's new cockpit view is hands-down the most exhilarating and realistic experience that you would have behind the wheels of a car. From the shaking of the car, the heavy breathing of you as the driver, and best of all the disorientation that is experienced when slamming into a wall over 100 mph.  The graphics are also the best in the series, with a great polish over vivid colors, plush textures and practically no frame rate issues. I gave shift 4 stars for entertainment value because it simply is very entertaining. However I gave it 3 stars in over all because of some minor set backs that don't entirely bring the games value down, but don't help very much in the over all dept.

My grips with the game come in random fashions: 1. Instant relay is somewhat lack-luster, with poor camera movement and excitement, though kind in mind the series has really never had replays, except for Underground 2. 2. Customizations have dumb down too much, this coming from a series that invented the ""auto-sculpt"" in Carbon. 3. Lack of visualization in the menus, before the series offered a ""photo mode"", to get an overview of the car, but that has been taken away by far.

So all in all, this is a solid title with plenty of replay value for the time being. Now sure how shift will hold up once Forza 3 and GT 5 are released, but it definitely fills the void for the time being. This game falls somewhere in-between the hardcore simulation and the casual arcade racers. If you are open-minded and prefer to play both types of racers, the Shift is worth your time. However, if you a junkie for tuning cars and customization of engine parts, then this game may not be for you... just remember to have fun with this game, that's what it was created for!",3.0

Obviously they attempted to reach a level of philosophical deapth that Bioshock 1 seemed so famous for, but this was a little more mumbo jumbo-y and didn't feel as authentic.

"I know I am going to get ripped for this review

I love the beatles, I love their music, but their music doesn't seem to translate into great game play.  I think the problem is that they beatles songs are very simply constructed and I don't feel any real challenge when playing the guitar. Going through the game is a breeze and the only real challenge is to see if you can get 100%, which you can on most songs.  As one review put it, you don't get any special achievements for getting 100 percent, which is a drag.  Now, I have played it on single mode and maybe it would be more fun with other people.  But there is a big problem, in my honest opinion, about The Beatles Rock Band.  It soooo simply (and a bit dated).  How are you going to get people who didn't grow up with the music into it?  Too tell yo quite honestly, I perfer to pick up guitar hero with challenge rock tunes from 70's to the 2000's because frankly, its more challenging and entertaining.
Now I will say this, I do like earning the photos and finding out facts about the Beatles.  I do like that use the beatles image as you are playing the songs and from the appropriate time of the songs.  I think when you go into Beatlemania, the crowd could be a little more amped up.
But overall, these are some great songs and if you are a Beatles fan, yo uare going to love the game because you get to BE a Beatle.  But I just wish it was a bit more exciting.  It's not the game fault though, The Beatles were the masters of the 3 minutes song with the simple song construction.  I just don't think I am going to go back to the game once it is done... I don't know.. it doesn't really hold my attention that well.  I found myself looking for other things to do or thinking about other games WHILE in the middle of playing one of their songs.  I don't think it's going to be that fun for anyone in their 20's, possibly 30's.  Sorry.",3.0
"I got this controller a few days ago and I already hate it. I thought it would be great because its wireless. That's probably the only great part about this controller. I play on expert, which requires a lot of hammer-ons and pull-offs, and with this controller, the action is MUCH slower. The buttons are a bit sticky and stay pressed down a split second after the note is released. This completely screws up my streak in the solos and basically any notes that are very close together. Also, the whammy bar is loose, causing it to face downward when I'm playing, so I hafta find the whammy bar every time a tail comes along. The strum bar also springs back too far sometimes, causing the note to be hit more times than intended. Oh, and the buttons are facing the wrong way (the round edges facing me rather than the ground). I'm most likely gonna sell this controller and get one of the wired controllers instead. They're more reliable.",3.0

Sony vita was slim piece of cheap crap and reason why I say it because it is easy to break. I gave up on Sony handhelds. It was alright because it had a awesome library of games but cheaper made. If you want to play vita games get a pstv because it is better. Handheld I recommend Nintendo more.,3.0
"The Good: Looks good, great story and voice overs, controls well

The Bad: Smaller areas to explore, even less side missions than the first game, annoying camera, nothing new

It's 1191 A.D. and Acre is still not safe from the clutches of the Templars. Altair is once again at war with the seemingly never-ending Templars to find the Apple of Eden. No one knows what this strange artifact can truly do, but Altair doesn't want them to be the first to find out.

If you were disappointed to find out that Assassin's Creed II wasn't a true sequel to the first game, look no further. Bloodlines is the first game's only and true sequel. Those who played the original will be on familiar ground as Bloodlines is almost exactly like the first game - both in good and in bad. You still play as Altair and can run, hop and skip to your heart's desire as you play the story through. The main difference, however, is that Desmond Miles is nowhere to be seen, as Bloodlines only concentrates on Altair's story. There are some other rather interesting differences here as well, so you'd better read further.

There are two different sets of controls: low profile and high-profile. In low profile, you can walk, blend, attack etc. while the high-profile allows you to sprint, run and free run up walls and buildings. You can run up practically anything that has a ledge or some sort of foothold. However, the PSP controls seem to be a little too sticky for my liking. If you are only one or two paces away from anything, Altair will cling that object even if he can't climb it and this can be extremely frustrating when running from guards in order to find some place to hide in. Free running isn't too hard, but just a bit finicky.

The combat system is simple and pretty easy to use and it is exactly like in the first game. Holding down your block button and waiting for a soldier to attack, and then counter-attack is the best route - just rinse and repeat. You can also attack first, but since you're usually surrounded by a superior force, it is usually wiser just to wait and counter-attack when attacked. If the guards are not on alert, you can naturally assassinate them by sneaking up behind them with your hidden blade or throwing knives at them.

The world in Bloodlines is not `open' in the same sense as the world in the original was. Instead, it is formed of small little areas. Also, the layout of these areas is often a little too restrictive. While in the original, you could find alternate ways to your target, the routes in Bloodlines are often too restrictive and you end up having to fight groups of enemies with no place to hide or run and no way around the enemies. You end up having to fight them all off. The restrictive world is also evident in the lack of high points on the maps. While in the original you could climb on the specially marked high points in order to synchronize your map and unlock new areas, these are few and far between in Bloodlines.

As far as it comes to side missions, there are not many of them available. The available missions range from delivering messages to assassinating targets to helping citizens being bullied by guards. Unlike in the original, some of the side mission in Bloodlines are timed. Another small addition that is different from the original is that after each main chapter you can upgrade items using the gold coins you find throughout the game. This is slightly similar to Assassin's Creed II, but the economy system isn't present.

Simply said, the game is gorgeous. However, it doesn't look like the first game. Bloodlines looks like what the first game would be if it were ported to the PS2: there is no bump mapping, no HDR (high dynamic range) lighting, and the graphics certainly aren't in HD. But even with these limitations, the graphics are highly detailed with great looking models and menus. There is no evidence of slow-down and the voice acting is terrific.

Overall, the gameplay in Bloodlines is perfect for portable standards and running around in the small areas is pretty fluid, even if the controls are slightly awkward. Bloodlines is a great first attempt to get an Assassin's Creed game on the PSP, despite the subtle flaws that make it feel like it was a bit rushed. Nevertheless, I found the sneaking around and assassinating people very satisfying and there were enough areas to keep me occupied. The game takes about 6 hours to finish - depending on your play style - so I found it well worth my money.",3.0

"I really enjoyed the first 2 Silent Hill games back in the day.  This silent hill certainly has raised the graphics bar considerably, but graphics don't make a silent hill game good.  This game was kind of hit and miss for me.  It started off good then started to taper off. I'd read the combat was better and i suppose i agree to some extent, but overall its still frustrating.  They have added a dodge feature, but the timing is really tricky and i found myself getting hit more than i dodged, which pissed me off...alot.  I like my silent hill games to be stressful to some extent, but not because the combat controls stink something awful.  The fog still looks fantastic, but i found myself missing the dark grey grainy look from the older games.  Most of the puzzles were very simple, but i came across one in attic of your parents house that is so fracking annoying i almost quit playing right there, i had to get online to find the solution.  Overall i can't really recommend it unless you are a die-hard silent hill fan.",3.0
"Finished Resident Evil 5. It looks amazing. The African environments are stunning to see. I applaud the game creators for making levels that are more than dark cramped spaces. This game adds Sheva as a co-op partner. She aids you when you need it without distracting from gameplay. The control schemes stink. You are limited to a small number of choices for controller configurations without opportunity to customize them. Lastly, zombies use motorcycles & guns?! I wish Capcom had spent more time coming up with something that fit the survival horror genre better. If you can adjust to the odd controller schemes and can forgive the genre bending design decisions, then you will like this one.",3.0

"As a target shoot that competes, I love to play Wii games that help me refine me eye-hand coordination and response times.  That said, I was happy when Nintendo released their designs for the Wii Zapper, however, something bothered me.  The trigger was in the front while the grip was in the back.  This goes against most firearm setups as most target shooters place the grips in the front while the trigger is in the back.  This way, it feels more natural using your dominant hand as the trigger hand otherwise if you put it in reverse you either are forced to use your non-dominant hand or flip the hands around and are forced to keep the firearm pressed against your chest to keep your eyes down the sights.  The latter is an extreme no-no for anyone who has fired an actual firearm as the butt of the rifle should go against your shoulder, NOT your chest.

That said, firearm practitioners will find the Wii Zapper extremely non-ergonomic and somewhat cumbersome.  Anyone who has not fired a rifle will not notice the difference and adapt.  It is understandable why the Wii Remote must be placed in front since the forward laser needs a clear line of sight, however, it takes away from the feel of the zapper.  I bought the Zapper and quickly purchased the Nyko Perfect Shot as it feels more natural as a sidearm than the Zapper as a rifle or carbine.

This is not to say that the Zapper is not worth getting.  Link's crossbow training is very useful at practicing your usage of a standard Wii Remote and Nunchuck as it is with the Nyko Perfect Show.  I use my Perfect Shot on Link's Crossbow Training every now and then to improve my reaction time as well as eye-hand coordination.  The game hosts several excellent exercises to maximize efficiency with any firearm-type Wii device so it is worth paying the money over.

All in all, the game makes the Zapper, not the other way around.  Get the game but get the Nyko Perfect Shot to compliment the game.",3.0
"I bought this as a release day purchase and was pretty excited to get it as an tweener until Skyrim comes out. The game really looks great, and the graphics are good quality (although not great). As many have mentioned, the voice acting s pretty bad. My primary issue with this game however is the ""spin"". What i mean is this: when you try to turn your character, the whole game starts spinning out of control. It is very dizzying and disorienting. There is no way that i can find to slow down the controller action, and so anytime you want to look around, you have to deal with this. Although i will give playing this game another chance, it basically rendered it unplayable when i first tried. That aside, when you can actually have a moment to enjoy the game, it seems pretty col. Just one horribly impactful glitch. I give this two stars, but i suspect if i could get past that deficiency, it would end up as a four star game for me, or at least 3 1/2.

ed: I left everything up from my initial review, but I wanted to update this as they seemed to have fixed the issue with the uncontrollable spin when you look around. Now, I've actually been able to play a bit and am enjoying i so far. I cant say it wows me, but I did upgrade my ranking on this to three stars to reflect the changes.

"I've always LOVED the Sims Series. The expansion packs are always good but rarely amazing. This one is the same. I got tired of the detective career track very quickly despite of knowing this game can be repetitive sometimes. In Sims 3 as a private detective, you get to go snoop around, stalk, sneak into someone's house, etc. It was more fun. This is plain old boring repetition. The puzzle is too easy to solve. The doctor's career track seems the same so far. I have yet to try the scientist one.",3.0
"I have been looking for a realistic baseball game.  The overall rating for this game is a comparison between what I was looking for and what I found.  I give it is 3 stars. 5 will be what I was looking for and 4 is Wii Sports game.  However in terms of fun it has 5 stars.  I will explain why, as follows.

I was looking for a baseball game that had a realistic swing.  In Wii Sports Resort you can have direct control over your sword, while in The force unleased you swing sideways or up/down to trigger more complex sword moves that are not the moves you did with your Wii-mote.  So The force unleashed is not a realistic sword game, but an arcade game, as you do not have direct control over your sword.

In Wii Sports when you are swinging, same happens, you place your bat looking backwards, pointing slightly up or down and it determines the height of the swing.  Then you shake it forward to swing, so Wii-mote moves are not the one of the bat.  As you may know, this is not fully realistic, as you normally hold a real bat almost vertically before swinging, but it works.  So this is what I would call ""4 stars"" (very good, but not perfect).  Wii sports allows direct control as response is immediate and you can regulate the height of the swing, but not in a fully realistic way.  Realistic is what I would call ""5 stars"".

I was looking for such a realistic swing.  Bigs 2 offers a ""3 star"" experience, just like The Force unleashed, where shaking the Wii-mote makes the swing.  And regulating where you bat is not very intuitive so it requires trial and error.  Also, Bigs 2 swing seems to have a fraction of a second delay, so you swing and a few moments later the swing takes place, unlike Wii sports.  It is weird to make a decision to bat without even have time to see where the ball goes.  So it would be worthy of 2 stars.  So why I give it 3 stars to the game?

I am not a hardcore baseball fan, so I do not care if the roster is outdated or not, or if the faces look just like real players.  It would take a fan to make this evaluation.  So I am disregarding this aspect in this review.

What I know is that it looks fine for a Wii game (graphics) and motion of players look fine.  I also liked the way you do the fielding with the Wii-mote arrows.  It takes some time to get used, as in Wii Sports fielding is automatic (you have no control).

Also, the pitching is far more complex than Wii Sports, but I think it may be worth the extra effort (my subjective opinion, someone may disagree) as you exchange straight-forward pitching of Wii Sports for some more elaborate pitching with more stages.  So first you select where you want to throw, by pointing in a box, and then the point is fixed when you press an arrow in the Wii-mote to select the kind of throw.  Then you make the Wii-mote to point up and keep it there to regulate the force of the throw and then you shake down to throw, and you can add some rotation by twisting Wii-mote sideways.  It takes a while to get used.

Why is it an arcade game?  You can attach a Nunchuk, which is weird, as you would feel it is strange to have something hanging from your bat.  However it is better than having a gamepad like most of past consoles.  I never got used to gamepads.  So as you may guess, it is not a realistic game in terms of controls, it is an arcade game that uses Wii controls in a way where you have no direct/realistic control, just like The force unleashed.

Of course, I suspected it was an arcade game, as Amazon's specs say so.  So I am not disappointed, I knew I was taking a risk.  Why did I buy this game then?  Wii Sports does not have anyone commenting the game, the crowd in Wii Sports does not sound excited like in a real stadium, and players and camera angles are not just as cool as in real baseball games.

Developers may be proud of their effort.  However, if they wanted to go one step beyond, they may like to play PES 2012.  PES 2012 have very intuitive and straight-forward controls, and it takes advantage of Wii controls that makes it better than Fifa, and that makes the gaming experience very smooth and cool.

I will keep on dreaming on the day in which I can grab the Wii-mote like a real bat and have a realistic swing that has no delay.  Until then I will have to remain in the arcade baseball arena.  It is quite fun, but not realistic.  Well, it is an arcade game.",3.0
"Allow me to try and write a review based upon countless hours of play and analyzing the layout and structure.  First, this is a 4x, DEEP strategy title.  When first starting the game, leaving the help hints on and seriously reading them can help you better understand the workings.  The manual; I use only to look up a reference if something is confusing me (a.k.a. what Casus Belle was).  If you try to understand the game by reading it cover to cover you won't succeed.  It takes TIME to understand how the game manages the A.I - and YES, you WILL be using the A.I. in LOTS of cases.  The programmers wanted the gamer to feel like he's the leader/president/emperor of a galactic civilization, not a viceroy of a particular planet or solar system, therefor micro managing is definitely out of the question.  Looking back over your systems from time to time to fine tune is what will get you ahead, not working out each detail of each planet each turn.  Another part of the game - shipyard construction, can be very confusing if you don't know how each style of ship can be used.  The only way to decide is to play, create ships, and see what happens.  It's now second nature to me to create fleets and ship types, but it took many hours of understanding before I could finally do it `on the fly'.  This review may sound cryptic, but really the only way to understand the game is to dedicate and play, with an open mind and a willingness to use your imagination.  I personally believe that the A.I. could have been fine - tuned to balance ship and troop construction (It seems to build too much of a certain type).  The game is slow, but consuming.  I recommend it for anyone who loves deep strategy and has a willingness to learn.  It could have been better though.  Try to borrow or rent before you buy ^_^;;",3.0
"SNK's answer to Street Fighter, the World Heroes series has never gotten as much recognition as SNK's other franchises like Fatal Fury and King of Fighters, but that doesn't mean it wasn't any less deserving.  World Heroes Anthology includes World Heroes, World Heroes 2, World Heroes 2: Jet, and World Heroes Perfect; all of which have been more than faithfully re-produced for this PS2 compilation.  That in itself is where this collection's biggest flaw also lies: some of these games haven't aged too well.  The first World Heroes game is as archaic as can be in terms of its controls and playability, with the second game suffering a majority of the same problems.  World Heroes 2: Jet improves a bit, and World Heroes Perfect is by far the best game on the collection with its fast moving fighting gameplay and well-animated sprites.  Like the previous PS2 SNK compilations, there isn't a whole lot else to be found on the disc in terms of extras (besides a color editor), but for the budget price tag, you pretty much get your money's worth here, especially if you're an old school, 2-D fighting gamer.  All in all, World Heroes Anthology is worth picking up if you're a fan of SNK's various franchises, but for others, proceed with some caution.",3.0

"I bought this game for nostalgia sake. It was one of my favorite on the NES some 300 years ago, and it's still cool today...(But) This game is riddled with cinematic scenes...so much so that I fear if I had watch them all without skipping I would still be playing the game....20 years from now! Every little thing has a cut scene! EVERYTHING! It's just too much and cause for a rather frustrating game experience. The controls are a bit finicky as well, and take some time to adjust to. (Nothing like learning to play Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons, but still a bit annoying). Other than that the game was fun as alway. The graphics and improvements were beautiful to say the least. I loved the added effects to the background. The boss fights were still just as repetitive as in the original, but I actually liked the fact that it wasn't changed. All in all I'm glad I bought the game. It was well worth the money. If you loved it before, you will love it today. Now, if someone would just remake the NES game Battle Toads, I would be in heaven! :p",3.0
"Pretty good game.  Others have amply described the good bits.  Two things I didn't like:

The plot is pretty good, but, without giving away any spoilers, the punch from the dramatic scenes throughout the story is sapped by future developments.  It happens on many occasions.  I found it to be rather cowardly and it would have been a better story overall if they didn't do this.  Also, several times during the story, you are asked to make an important choice, but a lot of the times the choice you make has no appreciable impact on the development of the story.

I also found one aspect of the gameplay somewhat annoying.  When a defending unit kills an attacking unit with a counterattack, the tile that the attacking unit was occupying is vacated, allowing subsequent attacking units to move into the same space.  Thus, sometimes counterattack kills can be a disadvantage, because the defending unit is vulnerable to being killed by subsequent attackers.  It seems anomalous to me to actually hope that your defending unit does not kill an attacking unit in a counter attack.  Sometimes, if you are in a situation where you are finishing off an enemy unit, it's actually advantageous to equip your weakest weapon so that you have enough power to finish off the unit you are attacking, but not enough power to counter attack kill units that attack you in the next turn.  Final Fantasy: Tactics sidestepped this gameplay anomaly by having a downed unit leave a corpse in their tile, preventing subsequent units from occupying the same tile, which I prefer.",3.0

"The storyline simply doesn't make any sense or even slightly enjoyable to me. I feel zero connection or understanding of the character(s).

Being a long time Assassin fan i couldn't wrap myself around this even from the beginning roll out of the game. But ended up purchasing to see if Ubisoft would deliver a better storyline then that of the original one. Failed tremendously, but i was wowed by the level of Detail and the full use of the latest graphics capabilities. Other than that this game is quiet unplayable to me. The first couple of missions i dragged myself through are beyond weak, it may be the fact that this game is heavily revolved around guns and explosives rather than hand to hand fighting makes this freaking boring. even the hand to hand fighting is just rather difficult to understand as the mechanics often don't work as the creators intended. I see the style they tried to implement but its just no where near as good as the mechanics of the first Creed.

Major problem with Ubisoft, is that they fully implemented online game interaction foro single player gaming. Not to fun to me, another reason why gaming is starting to become burdensome. But i'll save that rant for a forum or something.

Pros
-Best Graphics I've seen next to Battlefield 3
-Smooth game play(synchronized transitioning)
-Lots of Features

Cons
-Boring
-Boring
-Boring
-Weak and under developed Storyline
-Extremely downgraded Fighting Mechanics
-Boring
-Modern weapons are annoying to use

"while i was waiting for my SIMS 3 to arrive, i read some reviews that mentioned this game felt hollow and ""soulless"" and now i totally understand what they meant by that.

i've been playing for a week straight and even though the game has more things to do, i kinda miss SIMS 2. when the characters ate or danced in SIMS 2, it was done in an exaggerated way that was entertaining (slurping their bowls, or awkwardly bustin' out into breakdance). now in SIMS 3, they just do it for the sake of doing it and almost too realistically. this is why, for example, ppl have different opinions about being able to micromanage their sims while in a store (which you can't in SIMS 3). i'll bet they'll do nothing interesting in there anyway because these characters have no character. they may as well have made the whole user-experience into just clicking through a to-do list and not see the characters at all. because that's what it feels like i'm doing sometimes.

the thing is, this is SIMS! -- it's supposed to be an entertaining GAME, not another boring second-life simulation, which is what this is now turning into. i say that w/the utmost respect to what SIMS 3 now offers, i mean i'm a big SIMS fan in general. i just hate to admit it but yeah, i'm a little disappointed this time around :T

"I'm a gamer who spends most of his free gaming time parked in front of his PC, whether it's playing FPSs or MMOs.  The two most important things a gamer needs are a comfortable headset and a comfortable mouse.  On the mouse side of things, I've been using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G9-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000UHE8Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G9 Laser Mouse</a>, a laser gaming mouse I've really enjoyed.  But I'm always curious to try other mice and jumped at the opportunity of taking a look at Microsoft's SideWinder series.

On a purely tech level, the SideWinder is pretty nice.  With a high click count (10 million!) and 2000 DPI for tracking purposes, it's a durable, fast mouse that should satisfy gamers everywhere.  I also appreciate the ""on-the-fly"" DPI-switching feature (the three bars down the center).  However, I didn't find the DPI-switching to be as effective as the ones on the Logitech G9 mouse, which offer a few more options in between.  I found myself wanting a setting between the fastest and the mid level once in awhile.  I also wasn't sure how I'd feel about the vertical buttons on the side of the mouse, versus the horizontal, ""slit-type"" buttons on most mice.  I actually liked them better than I thought I would, but it's purely a matter of preference.

The problem I have with the mouse is that I don't find it to be very comfortable.  The way it's designed isn't ergonomically fit for me and I find it sometimes cutting off my circulation, due to the way it fits my hand.  I find my wrist/hand on a slight upward slant that didn't really feel comfortable, especially when you add in the circulation issue.  For this very reason, I probably won't use the mouse as much as I'd like and I definitely prefer the feel of Logitech's G9 instead.

Which is a shame because I do like the options it offers, it's not as pricey as the Logitech G9 and it's a solidly-built mouse.  But, like I originally said, it's all about comfort and this mouse just isn't doing it for me.",3.0

"Back when I was a kid, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were everywhere, even in video games.  There were plenty of them, but the best one, and many agree here, had to be Konami's TMNT 4: Turtles in Time.  That game combined the license with a surprisingly addictive beat 'em up arcade game style a la Final Fight, a combination which surprisingly worked.  Now, the TMNT license is becoming popular again, and Konami has released a new wave of TMNT games for the next-gen systems.  This GBA version is pretty much a watered down side scrolling beat 'em up that could have been done much better if time and thought were put into it.  The game is too easy, the generic looking enemies hardly fight back.  All that aside though, TMNT has some things going for it.  The character animation is smoothly animated, each of the four turtles has abilities unique to himself, there are mini-games to play which give you a break from the generic fighting, and long time turtle fans will admire various little features of the game.  I might be a bit too generous in my review, but if you can overlook it's shortcomings, there is some fun to be had with TMNT, I just wish Konami would have considered re-making TMNT 4 for the GBA instead.",3.0
"Until Dawn is an interactive teen slasher flick. How much enjoyment you derive from Until Dawn will depend largely on what your expectations are.

Until Dawn is basically a movie, and your interaction with it is minimal. If you've played games like Beyond Two Souls and Heavy Rain, it is kind of similar in concept to those. Until Dawn is an homage to B Horror movies, complete with all the tropes you'd expect. The characters are unlikable, the writing is stilted and awkward, and the acting is ham-fisted. The game is never creepy or terrifying, relying heavily on cheap jump-scares to freak you out. The gameplay, what little of it there is, consists of walking down hallways, pressing X to pick up clues, and timed button presses (Quick Time Events) during some cutscenes. At some moments you are given a choice between your character doing A or B, and you hold left or right on the left analog stick to make your decision. Actual interaction accounts for about 10% of the game, the rest is passive watching of cutscenes.

First the good: The graphics in Until Dawn are superb. I can say without hesitation that it is the most ""realistic"" looking game I've seen on the PS4 so far. The character models look great, the environments are incredibly detailed, and the lighting is believable and adds mood and atmosphere. As a tech demo, Until Dawn does a great job of showing off what the PS4 hardware is capable of. There is also the Butterfly Effect, the game's way of assuring you your choices matter. I haven't played through Until Dawn multiple times, so I don't know to what degree your choices change the outcome, but I've heard it's possible to have all or none of the characters survive the night. I did like that throughout the game when I made decisions, I felt like my decision had a lasting impact, even if it was a small difference.

The not-so-good: The animations are almost real, but unfortunately for the developers, the human characters fall into the uncanny valley and look off putting in motion. For those unfamiliar with the concept of uncanny valley, the idea is that as humanoid depictions (such as robots, CGI characters, etc.) look more and more real, we accept them as possessing human traits, except when they reach a point of looking almost, but not quite, like natural humans. These almost real depictions of humans cause a response of revulsion in people. There are moments where the characters in Until Dawn move and animate in an acceptable, if not realistic, way. But, more often than not, the characters wiggle their limbs or wobble their heads in an awkward way, or their face will contort with a weird expression that doesn't match the emotion of the dialogue delivery. There were many times where my wife and I would say ""ugh"" out loud as a character's realistic looking face made some unintentionally hideous expression and the characters landed deep in the uncanny valley. Note that this is not a critique of the intentionally scary ""monsters"" in the game, but the normal human characters in the game who are not supposed to look creepy.

The bad: The writing is really, really bad. Some moments, the dialogue sounds something like a human would say to another human, but those moments were so few and far between that when they did happen, I took notice. For the majority of the time, characters speak and behave in strange ways, and not for horror's sake. An interaction between ""friends"" usually results in two characters saying nonsense, then hurling schoolyard insults at each other for no reason. Why any of these characters are friends is beyond me; they fight with each other in nearly every scene. The acting, while not House of the Dead levels of bad, is still pretty cheesy. The actors in Until Dawn are professional TV and film actors, but you wouldn't tell from their performances here. I think behind every good actor is a good script and a good director, and I don't think these actors had the benefit of either. Given the dialogue sounds like something written by space aliens who are guessing at what human American teenagers might say, I can't really blame the actors for trying their best to make the script sound halfway believable. The overall story isn't too bad, but because it draws so heavily on teen slasher tropes, it also doesn't do anything to stand out. If you've seen movies like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Cabin in the Woods, and Saw, then you've seen everything this game will try to do. The pacing is also off, with way, way too much time spent developing the one-dimensional stereotypes that pass for characters in this game. There are also long stretches of the game spent walking from point A to point B with nothing of significance happening between.

The gameplay in Until Dawn is nearly non-existent. There are brief moments where a button prompt appears on-screen, and pressing the button on time means the difference between landing that jump or tripping, or a choice between two decisions can affect what a character says at a given time, but other than that, you don't really ""play"" the game in a traditional sense. There are times where you are given control of a character and can make them walk (hold L1 to make them walk slightly faster) down a corridor. During these moments, you can ""explore"" a tiny little bit and find totems and clues, but it's all very basic. These walking parts tend to drag on for far too long with not much happening, and since the area you walk in is mostly a narrow corridor, you just hold one direction on the stick for a long time until another cutscene happens. Not very exciting stuff. Weirdly, I ran into a few occasions where I held one direction on the stick, and instead of my character continuing to walk in a straight line, they would zig-zag around in one place. I'm not sure what caused this, and can only assume it's a glitch.

Despite my complaints, my experience with Until Dawn wasn't all bad. While I wasn't a fan of the writing, acting, or story, and the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, I did continue playing just to see what would happen next. Part of this is because there is no ""fail state"". There is no game over, even if your character dies. And the story has just enough variety to make you question what will happen next. The game is also fairly short, and can be completed in about 8 hours. If you're the curious sort, you can replay the game multiple times to see the different outcomes.  I also found that aside from a few jump-scares that made me shout ""woah"", I didn't really find this game scary. And I played in the pitch black dark. For context, I do find the early Silent Hill games scary, and the P.T. demo was easily the most terrifying thing I've played on PS4.

My biggest issue with Until Dawn comes from it's own desire to be a movie. I can endure terrible writing if the gameplay is thrilling. But if your game is mostly one long cutscene, then it had better be one darn good one. Unfortunately, the acting is mediocre, the writing is awkward, the story uninspired, and the characters fall into creepy ""uncanny valley"" territory. If you absolutely must play Until Dawn, I'd recommend renting it or buying it on sale for ~$20.",3.0
"mobile suit gundam...i remember seeing the preview for this  when i picked up my ps3 on launch night  i liked what i saw  .. so i picked up a copy .  ive heard a lot of bad reviews on this game etc..and honestly  this game is a mixed bag.  there is a lot of fun to be had with this one..if you just give it a chance...

sure, the gameplay could be a bit faster ..but it works for gundam (this is like a sim to a degree  in my opinion ) .. ok, its NOT as fluid and action packed as  robotech though  people tend to forget that..  But this game works..

say whatever you want,  but you have to admit..  it made an interesting launch title...and its worth a space in your collection..",3.0
"The Blood Omen series is very different from its sister series Soul Reaver (which I highly recommend). Don't get me wrong, this game is pretty cool at times. But I have a hard time getting past the lame combat system ( you have to hold down the left trigger and then press ONE button to attack). The blood drinking is cool, but the meter gets annoying. You have to constantly drink blood or the meter will run out and you'll die. This is also a very linear game, you have one path to go and thats all you can do, go forward down a straight path (I have a hard time believing in a huge city there is only one road or alley). BUT, this game is alot more accessible than the Soul Reaver series. People not familiar with the Legacy of Kain saga can pick up this game and have a good time. Soul reaver focuses more on building on the plot while Blood Omen focuses on action. If your a fan of action games with a good story I would definetly recommend picking up all of the Legacy of Kain games (Blood Omen and Soul Reaver tie in together). Start with the first Blood Omen, as is the start of this engrossing tale.",3.0
"I've been following this game's development for close to a year and literally freaked out when plot details and screenshots were released. They looked awesome and the first image of Connor got me giddy.

I pre-ordered the game, barely able to contain myself, thinking early on that it could possibly be my favorite game of the year.

Well, I was very wrong in that respect. I've had it since the day after it launched and I just didn't enjoy it as much as ACII, Brotherhood, Revelations or even ACI, despite that having some minor annoyances of its own. First of all, they rushed the release. This is one of the buggiest games I've played in a long time. I know with due time and patches, they'll be fixed, but seriously...If it was that buggy before release, they should've ironed everything out before launching it. I gladly would've waited an extra month (or however long it took them to fix the issues) to play a crisper game.

Secondly, there was way too much Haytham gameplay. After all the hype that Connor got as the new assassin, I thought it was ridiculous that I had to play as his father through the first *three* sequences of the game. Why not give him a sort of Ezio-style introduction and let the player control him from the start? Also, I don't know if it's just me really missing Ezio and Altair, but Connor (and the storyline for that matter) just didn't interest me like Altair and Ezio's stories and personalities/character did. They were both too flat and uninteresting in my opinion.

As far as the controls are concerned, they're certainly not as fluid as they were said to be and some of that is likely related to the glitchiness of the game itself, but they aren't completely terrible either. As far as Connor's weaponry is concerned, I appreciated the ability to dual wield and I love the inclusion of both muskets and the rope dart, but it seems they went overboard in showcasing his abilities, forgoing practicality in favor of epic-ness, something that seems cool at first, but as you play it becomes more like ""No way that's realistic."" (Yes, I know it's a video game, and I realize they wanted more of a ""Whoa!"" factor, but still.)

The other thing that really bothered me was the ending. I mean, really. All the hype and suspense over five years to build up to that? Really?? I won't spoil it for anyone, but I was majorly disappointed. It felt like a slap in the face honestly. Rushed and completely dissatisfying.

One aspect that is very fun is the naval warfare/battles. Ooooh, definitely my favorite part of the game! I had a lot of fun with them.

So overall, it's a disappointment.  Glitchiness and an uninteresting story/main character took the enjoyment down a notch for me, but it's not a terrible, terrible game, just not all that it could've been if you ask me.",3.0
"Blood! Murder! Brutal weapons! When I read reviews for this game, the little voice in my head said, ""buy this"". I did, believing that This would be another epic albeit controversial hit for Rockstar Games. I must say, I was rather disappointed. Yes, the graphics are quite nice (keeping with Rockstar's usual high quality), the sound is outstanding (the thump of a crowbar against some guy's melon is very chilling), and the overall atmosphere of the game is unique and, in typical Rockstar fashion, very controversial. But, I still think that this game is lacking in some points. Control is, at best, decent. All too often I have fumbled at the moment of truth, turning a stealth kill into three or four thugs turning me into hamburger with machetes. Graphics are, like I said, good, but nothing spectacular. Save points are frustratingly few and far between, and the game gets very redundant very quickly. The levels may change slightly, as do the thugs and weapons, but not the the point that you can really see much change from one level to the next. All levels are basically ""sneak, find weapons, sneak, kill, sneak, exit the level"". Sometimes there are items to find, or people to rescue, but ulimately this adds to the repetitiveness and frustrating nature of the game. The biggest selling point of this game is it's graphic death scenes and the overall nasty game content. I'm sure that this game will be on the news (if it hasn't been already), and angry parents will have a new game to burn en masse. Basically, I felt that this game was trying to be Splinter Cell meets Resident Evil. At best, this is a so-so action/stealth title with nasty scenes and content.",3.0
"This review comes in after just over three months of play from the official release date. At this point, many of the common release bugs others have complained about have been fixed. As well, some of the larger issues (such as the guild bank item and gold duping bug) have been found and dealt with. While there are still some gold farming spammers and bots roaming the land, their numbers have been significantly decreased. In short, the Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) world is now playable by all standards.

The basic game mechanics are excellent. Significantly different from the stand-alone Elder Scrolls computer games, I actually find ESO's combat system more enjoyable than Skyrim's (previous ES game), especially when it comes to casting combat magic. By leveling and gaining shards, characters can learn a large selection of skills in the game - but are focused into a specific role by only having a limited number of associated abilities available at any given time. Abilities can be switched during non-combat situations (so a character filling a damage role could switch to one of a healer), but they are locked in during a fight.

I've also found the quests to be very enjoyable. Though there are some of the traditional Fed/Ex and rat-killing quests, most others are more involved and are associated with one storyline or another. The over-arcing world quest (the same for each character) and the guild quests are well thought out and feel truly epic. The problem is, they also tend to feel like they're designed for a single player experience (because they are in the case of the world quest and the guild quests); most of the time, other players get in the way of enjoyment of these quests rather than enhancing the experience. As an MMO (Massive Multiple Online Game), this SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE.

Which brings us to ESO's biggest problem: it really isn't designed as an MMO. The group finder is difficult to use and is less effective than a zone-chat call of ""LOOKING FOR GROUP."" The presence of other players in dungeons detracts from the experience, especially when they are camping certain spawns. PvP is not particularly enjoyable, and is far behind that of other games. The game doesn't have a lot of ""sandbox"" features that would allow it to be played over-and-over again differently - as previously mentioned, all characters play the same main world quest, and upon its completion you're expected to submit to be randomly assigned another starting faction that you play in what amounts to hard mode. To put it simply: after you play through ESO's main storyline once, things get boring.

Rating: 3 out of 5 stars overall. If you enjoy quest-based CRPGs and have already played Skyrim, you'd probably enjoy buying this game and playing it for a few months (keeping in mind ESO has a monthly subscription fee at this time). If you're looking for a really good MMO that is fun to play in a group, though, look somewhere else.",3.0

"This was a solid enough game. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if that were an option. First, the positives.

Fantastic cast! I love each of the actors and their performances were top notch.
Graphics were lifelike and very nice, with some exceptions mentioned below.
Powers were cool, and the controls were decent.
The story certainly wasn't ground breaking, but it was pretty cool as well. The live-action scenes were cool but I could have done without them.
Not a great variety of weaponry, but ammo was plentiful enough.

The not so good:

Although the graphics were good, there seemed to be a glare or haze over everything at a lot of points, which got distracting.
The controls, although good, had one major flaw or two. First, it felt like the character was constantly walking through mud. There was no sprint button and no melee attack. What? That's right. The only way you could do either of those things was to use one of the powers.
The cover system was clunky and I didn't like it. I would have preferred a manual cover system.
The power progression system was lame. You had to ""find"" the power up points, rather than using an experience based system. The powers were cool bet definitely not as cool as I had hoped for.
The game was incredibly linear, to the point it was annoying. For example, you could NOT open 90% of doors in the game. That's right, unless it was where you were ""supposed"" to go, you weren't allowed to open those pesky doors. Maybe they thought you would get lost.
I also had a number of game crashes, but not too many.
Overall, although the game was very solid, it was definitely over hyped and didn't quite hit the mark. I'm glad I played it, but if I were you I would probably wait for the price to drop to about $40, you'll feel much better about the purchase if you do.

***UPDATE

After finally finishing the game, I decided to ""round down"". I had originally given this 3.5 stars, but rounded up to four. After experiencing another huge flaw in the game that I forgot to mention initially--the checkpoints--I decided to drop it down to three stars. It is amazing to me that such a modern game would have a check-point and save system as idiotic as this, and that is putting it as kindly as I can. The final battle ended up being nothing short of one of the most frustrating and irritating experiences in video game history. Even though the final battle takes place in a number of stages, you have to do it ALL over again if you get killed. You go all the way back to the cut scene too. The result? It took me forever to finish the final battle because of this positively moronic checkpoint system. Trust me when I say that when you finally finish, any satisfaction or joy that you would normally receive from finishing off a game will be all but gone. You will be HAPPY it is over, and hopefully you haven't thrown your controller into the wall by then.",3.0

"Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude is a sequel to Larry's dos-based adventure games from the 80s. Now you play as Larry's nephew (also named Larry) and must work through a bunch of hot, single co-eds to earn the right to star on a reality dating show.

This is a hilarious game, but its obviously geared towards a certain demographic. If you're a fan of gross-out teen/college comedies like American Pie, Van Wilder and Old School, you'll dig what's here. The presentation is polished, backing strong voice-acting with great dialogue and cartoon-like characters and environments. Yes there's upper nudity, but lower nudity has been censored (if you absolutely want it all, buy the uncut PC-only version).

Where the game fails is that it's based solely around mini-games, and these get repetitive. There's only a handful of variations, from your basic ""whack a mole"" to the button-pressing equivalent of DDR, to one that makes you guide a sperm down the right path to hit the best dialogue choices. You have to play a series of these to win the girls over, and they just get repetitive after awhile. What happened to the good old selectable dialogue choices of old adventure games? There are also no puzzle elements to figure out, disappointing as they were a huge part of the old Larry games.

So it's three stars, but that's a very strong three stars for the overall humour and presentation. If you can get past the repetitive mini-game mashing, give this one a try.",3.0

Good Options like custom/normal cursor; volume controls for music and two types of sounds; 'eye candy' on/off.

Graphics okay but Find screens are a bit muddy.
Often have to pass by hidden Find screens (with needed objects) several times before they appear/ become available.
Have to run back and forth many times to different areas.
As is common with these games, every found object leads to 2 or 3 more needed objects until it's hard to keep track of them all and where they should go.
Storyline and most characters are not compelling.
It may be written for the younger player...

"Pros:

Arno is cute
Walking around the crowded and chaotic streets of France was enjoyable.
The combat makes you work harder
Customization is awesome
Visiting Paris during different time periods was a treat.

Cons:

Arno is Ezio 2.0
The story is weak
Glitches galore in the crowded streets
Micro transactions
Companion app

When I saw the trailer for the game showing four assassins working together to aid the French people strike back at their oppressors I was excited for this game. I wanted to know more about these four assassins, their friendships, rivalry, and everything in between. I thought they would be unique and offer us an assassin's creed story we had never seen before. Unfortunately what I got was just another run of the mill revenge/redemption story that seems to run rampant in this series. The story focus' on Arno, a man who is raised by a Templar grandmaster after his father dies. Sounds familiar *cough* Haytham *cough* he grows up a happy, wise cracking, ponytail wearing stud who sneaks into places to see his girlfriend, sound familiar *cough* Ezio *cough*. Well Arno must deliver an important letter, *cough* AC2 *cough* but his playful ways causes the death of his girlfriend's father and the man who raised him. Seeking revenge he joins the assassins. Personally, I'm about done with these revenge plots and I don't understand why Arno is the lead when the Elise (his girlfriend) seemed capable enough to seek vengeance without him.  A part of me feels like she should have been the lead.  A Templar joins the Assassins to seek revenge against the Templars who murdered her father. That probably would have held a little more weight.  Only problem is that it'll be just the reverse of the assassin joins Templars for revenge plot they have going on with AC: Rogue. *sigh* The plot really isn't all that great, Arno is cute but that's it, Elise is just there, the villains are run of mill fare, the presence of the historical figures mean nothing, and the ending was contrived and weak.

The game play itself isn't bad.  I loved going into sneak mode and as I stated before, the game makes you work harder than the previous titles. Enemies can now fight and hit harder than before. You can't just go on a massive kill streak slaying 30 men in the street. I'm glad. There are a lot of fans who might disagree but I love this as assassins are supposed to be stealthy IMO. You shouldn't be slaughtering 40 dudes and running through the streets. Especially when they are as crowded as the Paris streets. Some players still don't understand the importance of taking to the rooftops and so on so I can understand them complaining about being ""made weaker"" than before when what really happened is that the AI is more aggressive, as they should have been from the start. I wanted to play a full stealth assassin all the way through and the phantom blade is a very good weapon of choice for that. The only problem is that the blades themselves are so freaking expensive and the upgraded gear to carry more are so expensive to the point where it is a pain in the rear to go stealth all the time. You have to really think about your next move before firing off a blade shot. Sadly, I believe it is the micro transactions that makes gear et al so expensive with in game currency.

Speaking of out of game nonsense. It really ticks me off that I need to download a phone app to access IN-GAME features! I can't even download the app because it takes up too much space on my phone so, so much for getting the most out of my $60.00. Then we have this ""initiate"" website that I still have no idea what it's for. The very beginning of the game alludes to playing short bursts of different characters and I have searched everywhere for this in game and online and can't find anything more about it. So now I'm left thinking how random the prologue was and how it had nothing to do with anything.  I haven't even experienced the co-op yet because the online features were going in and out for me. And don't for a moment believe that the co-op is you and your friends helping each other out in the main story line, sharing the massive world together, doing assassin contracts and all the freaking activities Ubisoft gives you together. Nope.  It's just some non connected missions scattered about the map. In certain places you'll see a red icon on the map, if you go to you see a purposefully glitchy assassin standing there who is one of the present day assassin recruits, and you click yes to do the mission and you can run around a la watchdogs styles until the game finds some players. You can also start a club with friends to do missions together.

I'm quite sure everyone has mentioned the glitches. I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I haven't fallen through the world and my hair is in place et al. But I have seen things that break my immersion. Such as flags disappearing from people, npcs sliding all over the map including on top of carriages (which was funny), npcs rubber banding, clothes changing and flickering. I've also notices massive frame rate drops to the point of pure graininess, especially when I use eagle pulse.

Overall, aside from the glitches, it's standard assassin's creed. If you are a fan of the franchise you will like this game for what it is instead of what it promises, you'll notice the improvements and maybe like them (e.g controlled descent, aggressive AI, better stealth), and you can see the potential. However, if you thought Black flag was the step in the right direction then you will see this as a step back, if you didn't like the past AC games then you may not like this one.  Even though I am a fan I would have loved for something more, I wanted those four assassins teaming up a la GTA 5 or something lol! So yeah I am disappointed in the lackluster same old same old storyline. I don't even know if I will buy Rogue or any other assassin's creed game after this because I just see no point overall. The plot is going nowhere. Take what you will from this review.",3.0
"I had highly anticipated the release of this game and I really wanted to like it, but in the end I found it to just be rather mediocre.  I played about 4 chapters into this game before deciding to trade it in on something else.  I didn't hate the game necessarily, but it left a bit to be desired.

Breaking into places and picking locks & sneaking around & thieving valuables etc was fun at first, but eventually just got rather monotonous and lost it's luster.  Traveling around the city & squeezing through crevices etc got to the point where it seemed like a chore...became repetitive and/or tedious, and was sometimes confusing.  I personally had a hard time deciphering the map as well and was hard to distinguish where to go when I was trying to find certain places again or the merchant to buy materials etc.  I even got rather confused trying to find my way to the area in the 4th chapter.  Some people might have had no trouble there, but I am among many people whose navigational skills aren't always that keen, and having a confusing map to look at did not help matters.

Graphically Thief was not all that impressive, it seemed more like mid era PS3 graphics to me than eye popping PS4 graphics...and the frame rate was certainly not PS4 quality, compared to what I'd seen with games like Assasssin's Creed Black Flag or Tomb Raider Definitive Edition etc.  Graphically it was often somewhat choppy as well and character movements were sometimes choppy as well.  There were parts where character mouth movements didn't exactly match words being spoken, or was just a monotonous up & down motion.

Some of the environments in the game seemed fairly interesting and gothic, which I thought was neat, but much of the area left a bit to be desired, especially when gazing off across the city or a large expanse of space...much of the distant horizon seemed somewhat broken up & choppy.

The story seemed fairly interesting, but with all the many faults if this game I just simply could not bring myself to continue on with the game.  Just another attempt to profit off of an otherwise classic game.  I've never played the original PC game before so I can't attest to what it was like, but I have read reviews by others who have said it does not do the classic game any justice, and I believe it, judging from what I experienced myself on this PS4 version.

There are some who I have read enjoyed this game, and there may be others of you who do too...to each their own.  However, I felt it was a feeble attempt on PS4 and I would recommend renting it before buying and see for yourself whether or not you are going to like it.  Even though I gave it a 2.5, I did give click the upper end of the spectrum at 3 because it's not exactly a terrible game, but it's definitely not a very good game.",3.0

So, I cleaned the old connector up and put it back in the NES and it is working much better! I decided to keep the new connector just in case the old one decides to go out. Probably in another 20 years, but by that time there may not be a replacement for it.",3.0

"NOTE: I have not played this version yet for the PS3, but for some reason, when I chose the 360, it sent me here. This quick review is only on the 360, but from what I've heard, they are basically the same game but with different controller buttons to do different things.

March Madness 08 offers some neat features this year: 1). The post game is much better than previous versions of MM. Erin Andrews does a fine job of being the sideline reporter, and her presence offers a clean, nice touch to the game. Dickey V. & Brad Nessler give the game the usual collegiate feel, but honestly, I think EA should give the end user (us) the ability to choose different color commentary analysts. As often in the past, the commentary feels too repetitive. It is still better and more collegiate feel than 2K8's. 2). The player models look much better this year, as well as the collegiate arenas. They are almost dead-on!  3). The menu screens are very nice and easy to navigate thru ... ESPN is finally put to good use.

That's really about it, though. Just enough tweaks to get die-heard MM players to spend their money. It's really a carbon-copy of MM 07 if you take away the new post-game features and the slick menu screens. That's not a bad thing, though. Still, as well as the NBA game, if you want the ability to run with many teams, import your created players into NBA 2K8 and get better, accurate gameplay, College Hoops 2K8 is the game to beat. I will give MM 08 a slight edge on overall graphics and menu screens, but it still falls short to CH 2K8.",3.0
"I really enjoyed the game for the most part. However, there are a lot of bugs that can make this game unplayable for some. The big one to me was the drop in framrates that I get a little too often. The gameplay was definitely new to the Thief series, as there has never really been a 100% First Person version of this game. But I think that it being First Person really adds to the game play quality and immersion of the game. The story is okay, it lacked for me as far as content and really giving you a reason to continue on playing but the puzzles and all of the different ways to approach the missions really makes it a fun game to play.",3.0

The keys are very smooth, leaving very little texture, which can be difficult for finding your way around the keyboard in touch-typing.  The media keys were very nice though.  The volume roller and mute button are super handy.  The headphone/mic jacks are in very weird spots at the middle of the top of the keyboard.

A few years ago this would be a good keyboard for the price, but there's far better products out there today.",3.0

"This is a single player review of WIC.

Its hard to understand the glowing reviews this game has gotten.  Its a respectable RTS in the sense that it works as intended by the designers.  Unfortunately, the design is seriously flawed.

Lets start with the story elements.  The game starts out well, and indeed the story is more or less solid.  You defend the US west coast from Soviet invasion, and in between doing that you flash back to battles you have fought in the ongoing war with the USSR in Europe.  So far, so good.

Where the game narrative falls apart is in the characters.  You have your CO, a Colonel, who barks orders at you.  He's a reasonable if aggressive leader, and while he seems to bark out new orders every minute at least he is believable.  Unfortunately, your colliegues are not.  First is Major Bannon, who commands armor assets that occasionally provide you with support.  The first rule of character design is Thou Shalt Not Annoy.  Alas, Bannon is the Jar Jar Binks of WIC.  His voice is annoying.  He is ungrateful when you save his butt.  He talks back to his superior officers.  He questions orders, always, and complains about them.  He disobeys orders routinely, and through negiigence and dereliction of duty kills high ranking liason officers and civilians.  Did I mention his voice is whiney and annoying?  He ruins the game.  In the real military he would never make Major, in fact he would never make it past 2nd Lieutenant.  Military officers are among the toughest, most squared away people on the planet.  They have to be.  Minor mstakes are career ending.  Major mistakes get you imprisoned.  Yet this whiny, girllish Bannon persists through most of the game.  Disobeyed orders and killed civilians and allied soldiers?  Well - the story goes -  the Colonel gave him a dirty look as punishment.  As if.  In the military of 60 years ago he would have been executed by firing squad.  Today he would be imprisoned.  In this game he will command troops and annoy you for the next 10 missions.

Thankfully, Bannon gets relieved of duty, but his replacement is more of the same, minus the whiny voice.  Who knew that the job of an junior officer in combat is to second guess, undermine, and put down his CO instead of - say - actually carrying out orders and accomplishing the mission?  Its obvious that the developers never had any military advisors working with them.  The game is an insult to the military.  This is a strategy game and you should recognise that your customers might just have served and cannot stand - cannot stand - your depiction of officers as whiny babies who cannot get the job done.  In my experience the average company-grade officer in a combat arms unit is tough, smart as hell, brave beyond measure, iron-willed and tasked with a job so difficult that many civilians would whimper at the responsibilty and power they wield.  Imagine that the next time you screw up at work fully a tenth of your coworkers are killed outright, or some high number of innocents are dead.  Thats the pressure they work under.  Show some respect.  They earn half what the developers of this game make.

This may seem like an overly pro-military critique but the thing to understand is how these characters totally undermine the immersion of the game.  Simply put, the story is DOA for not taking the military seriously, and instead offers up a charicature that probably jives with the designers pop-culture sensibilites, without them even realizing it.  Even of you think this would not annoy you, read on.  Narrative is only one of several big problems with the game.

Now that immersion is circling the toilet bowl, lets look at gameplay.  Unfortunately, its tedious.  You start missions with some good sized maps, and apparently the designers were so impressed with themselves that they feel that you must visit every inch of them.  Every few minutes you're ordered to rush across the map to a new objective.  You are whipped around the map without reprieve.  In between you will be tasked with secondary objectives that - you guessed it - whip you around to even further flung corners of the map.  By the end I couldn't stand the Colonel or anyone else in the game.  I literally felt like I was playing VirtuaTennis with my units as the ball.

Taking an objective means camping some areas on the map, holding ground.  Too bad these areas are spread out and wildly exposed.  Want to take this area by setting some infantry up in the woods meters away?  No chance.  They must be parked out in the open where they can be cut down.  This wouldn't be so bad except you must simultaneously hold 3 or 4 such areas, and they are just far enough apart to prevent any kind of interlocking fields of fire.  They might as well be on opposite sides of the map.  This, primarily, is how the game introduces difficulty, since the units are powerful and easy to keep alive, especially infantry, which are amazing death merchants.  Two antitank squads in proper cover can crush a massive armor invasion far better than any two tanks could, so the designers decided the best way to prevent that is to make you spread them out.  The final mission takes this to such heights I was laughing to myself when I saw it.

The other glaring fault is the dependence on support fires.  Throughout the vast majority of the game you can call in huge amouts of artillery and other support fires to obliterate your opponent.  While this is a fun for a bit, eventually it becomes clear that support fires are at least as effective as all your units combined, and you end up spending a lot of your time calling in fires instead of - you know - moving your units strategically in real time.

All in all this game is a major letdown.  Company of Heroes is vastly superior in every way.  It is more strategic, the missions are better designed, the voice acting is better, and it respects the men it simulates.  The gaming press cannot be trusted.  There is no way this should have got 90%+ from most of the top reviewers.  I give it a 60% only because it looks nice, controls well and is free from major bugs.",3.0

"My initial reaction to this mouse was quite poor.  It looked and felt light, flimsy, and very plastic.  Most are plastic, of course, but little is done to give this one any texture, weight, or character.  I've had packaging material that was more noteworthy.

The difficulty for me, I suppose, was that I was coming from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G9-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000UHE8Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G9 Laser Mouse</a>, which has a body you can switch out according to the hand feel you desire, and an adjustable weight system.  I don't mean to compare the two, as they're from completely different classes, but it is worth pointing out that the transition from one to the other made for a disappointing experience.

The X5 may well be the entry level gaming mouse for Microsoft.  Right on the exterior of the box, you're greeted by a comparison chart between this model, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-SideWinder-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B000TTQFIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft SideWinder Gaming Mouse</a>, a closely priced alternative that includes adjustable weights and an LCD display.  It shouldn't have to feel like an entry level option though, and it absolutely does.

As a performer?  I have no complaints.  The side buttons (which feel a little like wobbly posts) are well placed and, well, functional.  It's a relatively large mouse, providing a more 'full' feel in the hand (not unlike the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G5-Laser-Mouse-931376-0403/dp/B000AY5YI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G5 Laser Mouse (931376-0403)</a>) than the G9 I lost to use and abuse.  Over just under a month, I've given this mouse a lot of use, and to its credit, I stopped thinking about the fact that it was new and different a few days in.  Which is to say that it didn't stand out enough to bother me, it performed well enough that I was never distracted by it.

Frankly, I'm not sure what else to ask of a mouse in this price range.  If you're more concerned about the price than the 'feel,' this may be a solid option for you.  After all, when this one dies, I'll feel like I got my money's worth, when the G9 bowed out after 6 months of use because of a problem with the connection between the cable and the mouse body itself, I didn't feel like I had received my money's worth.  So it's all relative.

Will I buy another one of these when this one goes?  No, probably not.  I miss the weight, feel, and at least perception of quality craftsmanship I got with the Logitech mice.",3.0

"Jak X: Combat Racing is a very fun racing game that I enjoyed very much.  Not only does the game have entertaining gameplay, but fun cut scenes, as well.  As the title suggests, as you race, you pick up items you can use, such as weapons and shields.  This makes the game more fun because you aren't just racing, but are trying to shoot your opponents and cause them as much trouble as you can.  And there aren't just races in this game.  There are other challenges, too, such as where you try to get more artifacts than the other players, or you try to ram as many drones as you can, or a race where you try to get through in as little time as possible by collecting tokens to freeze time.
There are also extras in this game.  You can get different drivers, including some you can get if there is save data from other games on the memory card, artwork, some videos (some are funny), and different things you can use to customize your vehicle.  There is also mulitplayer, as you'd expect.
But, there is one issue with this game I don't like.  There is apparently a glitch in the game that can corrupt the save data or even corrupt the entire memory card.  It sounds like it's not just the old copies of the game, either, but even the new ones.  I was lucky enough to play the entire game twice before I heard about this issue, but I'm not likely going to play again.  It's not worth corrupting my memory card.
So to summarize, this is a very fun game with a lot of variety, but because of the memory card issue, you play at your own risk.",3.0

But really, no one buys this series for the single player.  Which is good, because it felt like an after thought.

If nothing else, make the switch to keep up with the large player base and leave the elitists to play the one game they are good at.",3.0
This game has combines both strategy gaming involving numerous planets and such with tactical space and ground combat.  The graphics are of a good quality and the sound is as well.  What I found disapointing was the lack of scale for the battles.  Maybe 5-10 capital ships per side and ground battles are not what one would imagine a star wars ground battle.  I was hoping for more of the large scale space battles you could have with Star Wars Rebellion.  The gameplay is fun but gets repeative and old quickly.,3.0

"When I first bought Halo 1 and watched the stunningly amazing trailer for this game, I had long anticipated the release of Brute Force. On release day, I bought this game without hesitation. But I wish I would have waited to read reviews. As I said, this game definately had potential; but it just seems unpolished and definately didn't live up to the high expectations I had set for this game.

The core gameplay consists of controlling four elite supercommandos, each with their own unique special abilities. Tex is a tough soldier whose specialty is using dual weapons. Brutus, an alien creature, is the toughest soldier and his special ability is thermal vision, which enables him to see enemies in the dark. He also has the ability to charge enemies, which has a fatal effect. Flint is a long-range sniper whose speciality is target-locking. Hawk is a small, but tough soldier who can become invisible and sneak up on enemies and offer a silent, but deadly kill with her powerblade. The squad command system is easy to use and it enables you to instantly switch between soldiers in your squad and also allows you to issue commands to your squadmates. This makes the game seem like it would be tactical like Rainbow Six. But it definately is not; it is much more of a run and gun shooter where you run through the levels shooting at anything that moves.

The graphics in the game are very good and definately get the job done, especially in HD. Each member of your squad is very detailed and definately give them a life-like look. The environments also look good and make each level seem unique and different. The enemies are sort of hit and miss. Sometimes close up they will look stunning; other times they will look blotchy and unpolished. But overall, the visuals are pretty good.

The sound is good, but not great. The weapons sound good for the most part, but they will occasionally sound flat and unrealistic. Explosions and grenades look pretty good, but they sound unconvincing. Overall, the sound gets the job done, but it doesn't really draw you in like it should.

The value of this game is decent. The single player doesn't really offer much replayability, but the multiplayer is fun & the Xbox Live action can be exciting. For the bargain price of $10 - $15 that this game sells for, it is probably worth your money; but the game is definately not worth any more than $20.

Now, with all the good things I have mentioned above, you are probably wondering why I gave this game a lower score. For the most part, it is because of the combined overall experience of this game. The storyline is pretty lame and boring, and it doesn't really pull you into the action. All you will find yourself doing is not even paying attention to the story and simply running through the levels with your guns blazing. And without a good story at the core of a game, it definately brings down the overall experience of it. It also makes the game not very intriguing and it won't have you running back for more. Also, the missions don't have a lot of variability and will get repetitive, bringing down what could have been a much better game.

Bottomline: Brute Force is a suitable shooter on most counts, offering exciting action and a very good shooting experience; but with a disappointing storyline and an overall mediocre experience, it simply seems like a missed opportunity.",3.0

even if you buy the dlc with the free to play ondemand version I'm sure you'd save money in the long run.....

World of Tanks is Free to Play on Xbox360-XBOne,  & PC (Not sure on Sony's Hardware)
the 360 version is pretty good for a PC port if you like MMO Games this games is for you
The only thing you need is a decent internet connection and a XBLive Gold Subscription
with all the Gold Subscription  (Games with Gold 4 free games across two separate platforms 360 & XBOne a month) paying $45.00-$60.00 a year for XBox Live is worth every penny

The controls are decent for a all tank  style game
the 360 Controller feels right

The Gameplay is so/so (It's free to play IMO there are much better MMO titles like Defiance which is also free to play now too)
if you are into Online multiplayer titles your enjoy it
I played it a bit the detail even on the 360 is pretty amazing on old hardware it's a stunning looking game but, you really have no time to take in all the detail since it's a free for are you'll get blindsided very quickly

"First let's get the obvious out of the way.  This game is a shameless God of War ripoff.  Turning cranks while under attack, annoying flying imps, rotating bridges, button press minigames, very weak enemies that serve as fodder for your hack and slash attacks, orbs that lead to powering up your weapons, etc.  There's even an area where they blatantly had Typhon the Titan from GOW2 blowing wind at you in a cave.  If it was any worse it would border on copyright infringement.  However, I don't care how derivative a game is if it's good, so this is the last mention of those similarities.  BTW, I've never read Dante's Inferno so there will be no observations about how close this is to its source material.

Each circle of hell is themed with a different sin for which its inhabitants are being punished.  Unfortunately there are actually very few themed enemies in the game.  Most of your time is spent taking out standard undead soldiers and horned demons.  The stages themselves mostly feature black, nondescript backgrounds and very uninspired music.  The gluttony circle has mouths on everything, but most other levels were very drab.  The graphics are decent but look very unpolished, especially compared to other new PS3 games.  There's simply no attention to detail.  At no time did I ever feel nervous or like I was actually in hell.  The combat itself is really run of the mill, with individual scythe attacks having to be bought with the ""souls"" you collect.  Your projectile attacks stem from your cross, and I used those most of the game because at least they're a bit different from the standard fare.

Another issue in this game is the difficulty.  There were early times when it spiked as I was under siege from so many enemies, including some offscreen (how widescreen games in 2010 can have that issue is beyond me).  Most of the game I was able to use my powered up cross-themed projectile attacks to easily dispatch the waves of standard enemies from a distance.  A couple boss fights were frustrating as I tried to figure out what to do, while others were too easy.  I ended up beating the final boss on the first try, and that's always a very bad sign.

It's hard to believe that EA, the same company who made the bone-chilling Dead Space, could fail so spectacularly at setting the proper mood for this game.  The plot is razor thin, with Dante simply seeking to save the woman he betrayed.  There are some simplistic moments where his sins are brought up, but nothing that ever feels connected to the gameplay.  I always felt like I was simply dispatching foes to progress to the next bland area.  Cheap platforming deaths abound, with bad camera angles making it unclear where you need to land.  Then there was an area near the end which is icy (yes, ice in hell).  You have to walk slowly across an ice bridge, with sections shaking and breaking loose, dropping you to your death.  It was designed to make people throw their controllers in frustration, and is one more demonstration that people who hate gamers shouldn't be allowed to make games.

I never saw a single bug of any kind, and that's the most positive thing I can say about this game.  It only gets three stars because there was technically nothing wrong with it.  Without spoiling anything, they even had the nerve to directly hint at a sequel in the end.  This is a rental or bargain bin game at best, and even then only if you have nothing else to play first.",3.0
"This game comes with a lot of baggage.  If it were released as a different franchise, I think people wouldn't be nearly so critical of it.  It's a solid game.  Whether or not it appeals to you is another question.  It's a Duke game.  I am perplexed at how many popular franchises have rabid fans because of the ""story"".  Most shooters don't rely on story much at all and the in-game plot is always lacking for me, regardless of the game.

Duke Forever is really no exception.  There is a basic plot within which you plod along from level to level, solving puzzles and defeating bosses.  The graphics are fine.  I didn't notice any real horrible problems with the engine.  The only thing I really had a problem with was Duke's animations.  You don't notice it unless you're checking yourself out in a mirror, but they consciously decided to have Duke's animations mimic the stiff sprite animations from Duke3D.  I'm sure this was on purpose and intended to be a joke/homage, but...I just don't think it plays.  This would annoy me during multiplayer.

Other than all of that, the game is replete with references to how awesome the franchise is.  That's part of the charm of the game.  If you're a Duke fan - you really shouldn't pass this up, there's nothing wrong with the game.  If you like shooters in general, I think it's worth checking out as well.",3.0

"This game was touted as an improved experience on console. The graphics, combat system, inventory system, and the overall presentation were supposed to be improved drastically. However, what I found when I played the game was a game that bioware cut corners everywhere and the game just seemed to be rushed. Some things are improved somewhat such as the graphics (although there is still little detail in the overused areas in the game) and the combat system (which looks cool but 20hours or so in you get tired of the same old animations and the battles where enemies spawn out of nowhere over and over. Overall, I do not think the game was developed around the storyline, but the the storyline was made to match the game. The inventory system was less for the developers to do in the name of progress. Your party looks the same throughout (except for a few minor changes such as when Aveline joins the guard) and the upgrades must be bought from vendors although you can change accessories and weapons. The main problem I had with this system was finding the upgrades, I ended up searching every vendor every time something major in the storyline happened and if you miss some then it seems like they are not to be found as time passes by. The other problem with the inventory system is the sheer amount of junk you find that is automatically labeled junk and goes into your junk pile in the inventory. It cannot be looked at even though some of it is books. All you can do is sell it. Well then why not get rid of it completely and just give extra coin instead? The problems just start there though.

The storyline is missing the epicness that made Origins so engaging and this alone would not have been such a problem if there was at least an antagonist through the first 2/3's of the game. Somehow 20hours in I still felt disconnected from the world, part of this comes from each area being used over and over. If you have played Origins then think of Denerim only slightly larger with a few small areas outside of it and a night and day system and that is it. The night system just seems like another excuse to reuse the same areas over and over and make it seem like its bigger than it actually is.  The story also suffers because of lapses in believability, for my first play through i played as an apostate mage and although it is mentioned in conversation that the Templars are right on my tail, I never once felt like that was so, in fact the templars are so stupid that even as I cast spells in front of them (as I battled against some blood mages) they never once accused me. In fact during the conversation that followed they mentioned several times how they thought apostates were evil and needed to be stopped. The game also suffers when I do the item quests as there is no dialog or story but a random npc just says something like ""Thanks I thought I had misplaced that"" as you return an item you randomly found in a dungeon or sack or something. The best one was when I found someone's remains and this npc said the ""I must have misplaced that"" line when I gave them to him. The 10 years in the same city storyline just feels like it was built around not having to do as much work so the game could come out faster.

It's not all bad though, as where the storyline shines is with the character quests and interactions. These are too few though but they carry the weight and heart that the main quest is missing for the most part. The characters are all interesting save for the disappointing Anders and the DLC only Sebastion who are both kind of lame. That saddens me quite a bit as Anders was my favorite character in Awakening. Speaking to your party members and gift giving have both been ""upgraded"" as now you can only talk to them in their home base in the city and only when a quest pops up that says go talk to them. Gifts have been turned into quests and now there are a lot less gifts in the game. I would be remiss not to mention the new mass effect style conversation wheel which works well for the most part but even with that bioware cut corners as there are quite a few times that no matter what is picked you get the same generic reply from the character you are talking to. It also takes part of the fun of the conversations out as you don't pick your comment as much as you pick the type of comment you want to make. The voice acting is well done although there isn't as much voice acting here, despite the main character now talking, as there was in origins.

The leveling system has also been changed as certain skills or spells can now only be taken by certain characters, for instance Merrill cannot take any spells in the creation school. So for a healer mage your main character or Anders is your only option. There is only one true shield tank on there and it is Aveline. The main character is the only one who can take specializations now and each of the party members get options to take their own personal skills or spell school, which is neat but I liked the customization of the old system much better.

There are also couple of bugs I want to mention, the most annoying one being that I cannot attack with my mage sometimes. I can cast spells but then out of nowhere my mage refuses to attack and just twirls his staff around. If you switch characters then come back it fixes it most of the time. The other one that is just plain annoying is how loot sometimes will sit there after battle for a couple of minutes before it will let you loot it. For a fast paced combat system this is a major problem.

I love origins and gave Dragon Age 2 the benefit of the doubt since it was announced but it seems more like a spin off or a massive DLC than an actual sequel. I am still not regretting buying it, but after one play through I think I am done and it took me 3 play throughs before I started getting tired of origins. Dragon Age 2 is still a fun game but it could have been so much better. The seeds are there for one of the best rpgs available but this is the first time that I truly felt like bioware dropped the ball. Overall, I would say, buy it right now only if you are a huge bioware fan but prepare to be shocked and disappointed by the changes and the lack of polish on the title, otherwise wait for the price to drop before picking it up.",3.0

"This is a very well put together and Fun game that runs flawlessly on PS3 and is probably the BEST LOOKING game on the PS3 as far as character models and weather effects go. the environments of Afghanistan and Africa are refreshingly scenic with realistic sounds and dynamic weather and stealthing/shooting/existing in these huge environments is an Adventure i enjoyed for Days. the intelligence for the guards is a FUN CHALLENGE and watching them congregate trying to find me was a thrill for a while. FOB ONLINE also peeked my interest. i love recruiting and managing soldiers to Protect my FOB from other players online....but a few things here ruin the experience for me long term.

First, the maps. they're not BAD at all....just empty and uneventful for the most part. the enemies respawn in the same exact places everytime you deploy to the map. no waves of enemies that show up randomly every day....no map turf wars to speak of....nothing Genius like that....just an empty spot on the map once you kill everyone. after 40 hours, i didn't even bother going back to the maps unless i was doing the story or kidnapping soldiers for FOB. these maps kind of make me wish they stuck with the Ground Zeroes approach of Large Restricted maps so maybe they couldve made 10 to 20 INCREDIBLE maps with day/night cycles set all over the world instead of just 2 huge boring open world levels. empty and predictable maps that i don't ever wanna visit again is a HARD Negative.

Second, the FOB Mode. WHY IS FOB MODE UNLOCKED AT MISSION 22 IN THE SINGLE PLAYER??? NOBODY wants to sit through 20+ hours of long repetitive and difficult missions just to play an online mode. this mode should have been playable atleast by mission 10 or 11. now for the mode Itself, it is Fun and Challenging and is a great distraction from how bland the single player maps are BUT there are some issues. once you build an FOB, YOU CAN NOT CHANGE IT!!!! built a tower platform and don't like how it looks??? want to remove it?? No, its there Forever. ontop of that, most people use the Command Platform so youll see that platform 75% OF THE TIME when you attack someone else, gets pretty boring. but the part that hurt me the most is that you cant even VISIT your FOB in real time just to check everything out, only when someone attacks your base and is NOTICED BY THE GUARDS do you actually get to GO to the base -___- on top of that, when a player actually comes back to protect his base from you, IT STOPS YOU AND PUTS YOU BACK AT THE BEGINNING INSTEAD OF JUST BLENDING THE PLAYER INTO THE GAME SEEMLESSLY. this doesnt ruin the mode COMPLETELY but it does kill some of the immersion and make it feel Tacky and Cheap. this mode had ALOT of potential to be Great, even greater than MGO online but the decisions behind it are just QUESTIONABLE AF. a Negative for not letting us visit our own bases whenever we want to protect them....a negative for not letting us delete bases or position them wherever we want.....a Negative for just everything they did wrong with this mode, oh my god.

Overall: this game has some INTERESTING mechanics that i DEFINITELY want to see perfected and fleshed out in the future. the story is long, fun and challenging...the FOB is a challenge, even if it is Questionably Structured -____- and some of the missions are fun to go back and replay (especially Episode 14 and 21). this game will definitely hold you over until Fallout 4 comes out in November!!!!

sidenote: the character Quiet DEFINITELY needs her own game....or atleast some DLC detailing her life and story with some NEW MAPS....this character has the ability to be the new Laura Croft of this generation.",3.0
"This game is one I looked forward to most of my childhood coming from Spiderman 2, ultimate Spiderman, Spiderman 3 , etc I honestly had alot Of fun playing those games(not Spiderman 3 avoid at all cost) but this one lacked the magic of 2, looked worse then ultimate, city reminded me of how dead 3 was, filled with glitchs beyond belief (no updates btw ) Well also it starts off really boring for the first hour or two and when you see the side missions realize that they are nearly are all the same but the story also is mediocre at best with terrible voice acting on peter and it really does get annoying to hear his voice if you have to repeat a mission  also realize there are no trophys on ps3 with screen tearing happening here and there  ,enemies spawning in buildings you can't enter,and if you move the.camera on a building you sometimes get this tiny black blocks on the roof textures with some white lines on the building windows(not common) along with dealing with system crashes/freezing (not common) and controls that aren't always 100% responsive along with the most difficult camera to use when running up a building /jumping on the roof / can't adjust speed  and you can't continue the game after you're done/ no new game plus / one type of collectible that is nearly worthless
So you might be wondering if there's anything good about this game well the positives include interesting boss battles, really amazing combat, really good moral system that affects story not really the gameplay though  and awesome leveling up system, multiple ending types, and you can summon other hero's like luke cage,wolverine or villians like vulture, electro.also who you can summon completely depends on how your morals are  and such but the game length completely depends on if you do only the story or you do the side tasks(really boring ) they usually include kill #of enemy's,save #of civilians, protect civilians, or destroyed this # of times, honestly they just artificially extend the game time and aren't worth even doing but lastly even though the graphics aren't eyeball melting, mind blowing the animations are done really Well and some parts of the game make people like spiderman, wolverine look well made  but all in a if you have a young kid, or are looking for something to play in small segments then this is worth it but if your looking for something with high production value /doesn't get boring after a few hours then avoid this and get something else",3.0

"This game was great when I first got it.  But there is no replay value.  Even with the dlc up to taken King, this game came and went to fast.  The endgame for me just isn't there.  There is a lot of repetitive grinding for gear but no new content.  I give it a 3 star because when I started this game was five stars awesome.  Now that I have had it for awhile I don't ever play it :( and I would give it a one star fail.  But seeing as it is still really fun to play through once I cant just say it sucks.",3.0
"The combat is wonky compared to let's say Dragon's Dogma (even with the Circle Pad Pro or C-Stick), the quests are basically a to-do checklist of gathering random materials, killing monsters that have ridiculous hitboxes and temperament, and farming is an all-time high (and I don't much like wasting my time doing stuff like that).

I'm sure other reviewers gave it some praise, but I'm rather picky and expected something more... refined and mindful. The demo for the game was more fun to me, and I felt mislead. I guess no review or demo truly shows how a game works in the long run.

I will give it credit for looking pretty nice, and how it handles the ""classes"" in the game, while not requiring stats on a character to excel, when all that is needed is a few materials and a weapon of choice. Other than that, I'm just not interested.",3.0
"This game is neither good or bad its very average, lacking quite a bit of content for a $60 price tag, you pay for beautiful graphics but thats about it, it gets very stale after playing for about 4 hours",3.0
"With Episode III of the Star Wars saga hitting theaters next year, Lucasfilm licensing is taking the time to flesh out the battles of the Clone Wars through various forms of media - this video game is one of them. You start out at the battle of Geonosis from Episode II and work your way through the war campaign by campaign.
If you've ever played any of the games in the Rogue Squadron series (and by extension Battle for Naboo and Starfighter) you'll know what to expect. However, whereas those games required a more thoughtful and tactical approach to each mission, Clone Wars puts the emphasis on all-out carnage. Mission objectives are really vague excuses for you to blast and blow up the hoardes of enemies the game tosses at you. There are missile and health refills aplenty, and the convoys you occasionally have to protect are in nowhere near the danger the ones in Rogue Squadron faced. I wouldn't say the game is easy, but it's not nerve-wracking either. It's like a cheat version of Rogue Squadron where you get to blow stuff up and go crazy without worrying too much about the consequences, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
The graphics are okay. Emphasis was placed on getting as many bad guys onscreen with a respectable framerate instead of making everything look pretty, and it was a smart decision. You'll be too busy staying alive to care that the visuals aren't as advanced as other titles. Sound and story, which LucasArts usually excels at, are disappointing here. The in-game sounds are great, but the cutscenes are compressed. The story itself isn't that great either, with bland voice-acting. I'd rather fight seperate, non-related missions than have them all link together with a convoluted story.
In the end, Clone Wars is a decent game to pick up and play for a few rounds of mayhem. It's not a standout game by any means, but it's a recommended purchase for Star Wars fans and anyone wanting mindless excitement.",3.0
"This game is pretty good. I like how it features the voices of George Takei and Walter Koenig, and takes place in the mirror universe of Enterprise, Original Series and Deep Space 9 fame. It is a lot of fun shooting at Federation [or Terran Empire] ships in this case, and watching the damage increase before they explode. Same goes for Klingon, Tholian, and other ships. The only problem is that it's very difficult, I had to enter all the cheats from gamewinners.com in order to make progress. The game isn't too expensive, it's much like an enhanced version of Star Trek: Invasion for PSX. I would recommend it.",3.0
"This is the third installment of the Dragon Age series. It wa the first game I purchased for the PS4 and I played it thorugh to the end. It took a very long time to finish. There is a lot of content here. Unfortunately it isn't the greatest content. You spend a lot of time wandering about aimleslsy looking for shards (I didn't finish this quest) and other bits and pieces. You seem t spend an inordinate amount of time scrambling over rocks. The best paid person on the team must have been the rock designer. I felt like a rockhopper penguin. The plot isn't bad and the conrols work well enough but are getting too complicated as the series matures. The romances can be fun though. In the end I found a lot of the game boring and pointless. A smaller world, and a grappling hook would have made this sooooo much better. Let's hope the fourth edition is more exciting with less stupid scenery to scramble over.",3.0

Sorry I had to just update this review on the Razer Naga Hex MOBA PC Gaming Mouse - Green. You are right after a few months this mouse will stop working I have to remove and reset the USB cabling each time to get the mouse mouse working again. I also had to switch back to the razer death-adder mouse Man what a waste of money and time. A very nice looking gaming mouse but for $62 / $63 dollars come on razer Please talk to your staff on a rebuild. NOT HAPPY AT ALL AT THIS TIME WITH THIS ITEM :-( --------NOW AFTER A FEW MONTHS--- UPDATING INFO. AFTER CLEANING THE LASER ASSEMBLY I WAS ABLE TO GET THE MOUSE WORKING AGAIN. The mouse is working and I'm still using it to this day. At this point I'm going top test the equipment for about 45.60 days then write reviews Just a heads up don't be so in a rush to write a review with giving the equipment a true test for a few months. Sorry about that to all the razer users i'M STILL A BIG RAZER USED.,3.0
"I'm a pretty big fan of Lost and normally I don't play games that are based on movies or television.  Why?  Because they usually end up being terrible and really can't capture the essence of the show.  This game appears to be no exception to that rule.  I should've known based on the novels written outside the series, which also weren't all that great.  One thing I will say though, this game is better than those novels.  Maybe once the full mythos is revealed and the spin off literature can use the full breadth of Lost, then it will be excellent.  Until that happens... I fear we are doomed to mediocre stories based on Lost that can't reveal anything very new to us.

That being said one of the main reasons I did not like this game very much is the game play in general.  I feel like the controls were a little clunky and the environments can be somewhat hard to navigate.  Though this is the whole point when you go out in the jungle, and for that it's okay.  As an example, though, whenever you go into the Banyan trees to escape the smoke monster you emerge facing toward the camera so pressing forward brings you back into the trees.  In a section where escape and time are important this is ridiculous.  The missions where you have to run to escape something are more frustrating than fun.  It's very difficult, at times, to see what it is you need to jump over.  So this kind of functionality wasn't winning any points from the video game perspective.

Another point of contention was the voice actors.  Locke sounded completely different, which is kind of annoying.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if you're going to make an official game I like the original people involved.  That probably costs too much though, and this is yet another reason I tend to stay away from these off shoot games.

As far as the level design goes it's actually not too bad.  Ubisoft is big with things like Myst, so I would expect them to be able to capture an environment competently.  On this point the game scores pretty well with me.  I love exploring the various stations like the Pearl and the Flame.  I loved being responsible to push the buttons and seeing the maps.  I loved that I could explore much more of the Flame than we get to see in the show.  All of this was great and I enjoyed doing it.  Going to the Dark Territory and going through the slaver ship was awesome as well.  If you get that out of the game it's quite fun.

Here's where it sort of fell apart.  The story line.  The story line is just okay, in my opinion.  I think it breaks some Lost rules and brings up events that are too specific that they wouldn't be known in the show, such as your character saving Jack and Kate.  It's a bit too significant for it to never be brought up.  You basically play as someone who has lost their memory and upon waking up on the island after the plane crash you can't remember who you are.  The pace is almost way too fast, Jack appears to distrust you for no apparent reason for most of your time in the group.  Aside from going into the jungle when he told no one to go there, which in the show is a really minor offense for Jack, it seems to ruin his entire perception of you.  I guess I don't get it, while the characters were a bit close, they don't seem to be close enough to the show.  Their actions and motivations seem a bit odd to me.

In the end, if you're a die hard Lost fan then you will enjoy some aspect of this game.  I loved exploring the island and doing things in the various stations.  I did not like some of the controls from a gamer's perspective.  So there's a little give and take with this game, which is why I think it's only an average game at best.",3.0

"Combat Flight Simulator 3. My first real flight sim. I used to love it - it was all that I knew. Then I found that it was EXPANDABLE! I got the PTO Expansion, the ETO Expansion, the MAW Expansion, the Korean Theater Construction Set - all the freebies. Everything but OFF, Firepower, and D-Day. And I loved it.
Now out of the box, it isn't quite worth it. The flight models are not very accurate, its way too easy to stall, you're enemies (the ai) always have the advantage, then do something stupid. For the most part, they're predictable. It wasn't too bad (I was still a novice at flight sims), but it wasn't too realistic. The best thing to do was to go as a gunner...an autopilot flies the plane better than you could.
Out of the box, when compared to IL-2, IL-2 is much better - better graphics, flight models, damage models, etc.
However, with the expansions, this thing is dynamite! So if you have this, get all of the expansions you can get your hands on - I'd recommend you to start with PTO - Pacific Theater of Operations. Just go get your feet wet - I came back from the expansions with positive feedback.",3.0

"Many years ago, I played this game at a demo station and wished that I had gotten a PS instead of an N64. Having recently gotten a PS1 memory card for my PS2, I decided to get this game which I had very much wanted. I started it up, and... the game hasn't aged well. It's full of good ideas and originality, but the draw distance is pitiful and really diminishes the sense of exploration, and it sticks to some very outmoded design conventions.

If you're interested in videogame history, however, this is a fascinating game, as it shows what early attempts were made to justify having two analog sticks",3.0

"I'm a fan of action/adventure/puzzle games. As someone who lived in Tokyo in the past, I had an extra reason for wanting to check this out. The good news is that the game has three cases which are fairly interesting. The graphics are in color (as opposed to Hotel Dusk) with mixture of real photos and drawn scenes (with a tad of basic animation at the end of a case). I was really pleased to see that the maps and photos were of real places in Japan. The controls were easy to grasp. The game wasn't too long, either. Some people might consider this a negative, but, for these simple stories, it's a good thing. (In comparison, I thought Hotel Dusk was too long.)

There's some negatives, though. First, they changed the setting to America and created imaginary (corny) city names. That may have been more frustrating to me since I have lived in Japan and I know the real names of places. This was made worse by the fact that they left a street sign for Shinjuku (the games first area on the box art). Second, the game doesn't allow for mistakes. If you make a wrong choice, it will make you choose again. This wasn't terrible, but I can see why it would really aggrevate some people. (From my point of view, it saves time.)

In all, this was a decent game. I don't know that I'll play the second game, but I don't regret playing this one. It's definitely worth a rental. It has a noirish theme. It's audience is late teens (who would probably enjoy it less) and adults. It includes visits to bars and has a dedicated button to allow you to smoke. That plus the gameplay make it unsuitable for kids.",3.0
"God of War Ascension is a good game.  It's not great, but it's still quite good.  If you loved GOW 3, you'll like this game.  GOW 3 is a better game, but if you're looking for more of that experience, this should whet your appetite.  Feels like an extension rather than a new experience, essentially - even though it is a prequel.

As for the extras in the collector's edition ... well, I'm not super impressed.  The statue is made of a very light plastic and feels cheap.  Kratos himself is in an odd position, so I don't keep this one on display in my basement.  The InFamous and Uncharted collector's editions were much better.",3.0

"I'm disappointed. I'm an early adopter. I ordered over 5 months ago, and have been patiently awaiting this day for quite awhile.

Second, included is ""Cut The Rope"", but it won't run even though it's pre-installed with the software. Why won't it run? Oh, because it's a Mac exclusive game. No errors, no messages, nothing.

This reminds me of Kinect. We all thought it was going to be revolutionary. It's not. With my hand in a fist, it still sees a finger half the time. With 5 fingers out, it doesn't always detect 5 fingers. Watching demo videos, it looks like it's super precise, but it's inconsistent. A few of the apps are terrible, especially the free ones. The ones that have good ratings all cost money. I'm not really sure what this device is good for at the moment. I'll hold on to it and see what happens, just as I did with Kinect, but at this point it's as useful as the USB pet rock on Thinkgeek.com.",3.0
"I decided to delete the review I intially created for this game when it first came out. I've recently picked this came back up again used, because I was simply looking for a game that I could get in a high speed pursuit with the cops.

I had bitterness towards undercover the first time around, many of my complants surrounded the horrible storyline, lack of a main menu, freezing, and the jump to event icon that is pressed on your D-pad. BUt I think I've come to an understanding of this game, and I realized it's really not all that bad. The graphics are actually better than I remember, maybe it's because I recently had my HD tv cleaned and adjusted, but I found myself very satisfied with the presentation this time around. I also love the camera movement, when you flip a 180, which wasn't offered in Most Wanted. I also realized that the gas pedal is now push sensitive, which makes it more realistic in the terms of just slowing down and enjoying the sound of a V8 engine roaring.

I retracted to many of my complaints to see if they were ""truly"", justifiable. The story, now is it really that much more worse than that of Carbon, and MOst Wanted? I also complained about the weak aspect of garages, but seriously should that really matter when you spend the majority of your time on this game speeding on the streets? Not really. I also complained about the lack of a main menu, so that you can just mess around custimizing cars as I did in Most Wanted, but that's something I could get over now. And lastly. I was completely annoyed by the blinking icon which jumps you into the closest next race. I hated it because I complained to took away from the incntive to free roam, as many critics did as well. But now that I'm playing again, I realized that is the most moronic statement anyone can say about this game, and the reason being is just because the icon is blinking for a jump-to-next-race, doesn't mean you have to actually do it! Duh people, the only thing that is lacking is our ability to just drive around and enjoy, as I have been ever since I got the game again.

Even though many people disliked this game, I found that if you really enjoyed playing Most Wanted and wanted more after you finished it, then this a definite purchase for you. I can never get tired of running from the cops in a car that I customized myself, never. Also something that should have definitely been given credit is the new highway system, and battles. The highway battles are hands down, thee funnest races for me, because you are going head to head with another car in heavy highway like traffic. YOU are picking your lanes flying by cars and trucks at over 100-150mph, while trying to avoiding crashing into any of them.

Look this game obviously wasn't that bad if I had an urge to give it another try after so many months! I honestly feel it's worth the dollers for the highway races, and cops!",3.0

"+ Excellent little platformer
+ Variety of enemies and environments
+ Long campaign at 13 chapters (each taking about an hour to complete)
+ Pleasant story with seamless cut scenes

- Can often be too easy at times.  I don't know why reviewers were saying this game was brutally difficult
- Few boss battles for a platforming game.  I can count the boss battles on one hand.  There should be more but then again if these battles were too hard, kids wouldn't play it.
- Graphics really don't push the PS4 hardware.  This game's graphics focuses on Knack's particle effects or relics spinning around.  The environments and textures are often lackluster.
- Checkpoint system needs to be improved a little.

I had fun playing Knack and I am a 37 year old pharmacist.  This game is not brutally difficult like some reviewers were saying.  I got through the majority of it without having to consult YouTube walkthrough videos or having to restart from a prior checkpoint.  There are some puzzles sprinkled throughout the game but I was surprised that all of them were relatively easy to figure out.

I would recommend this game for kids and families alike!  It's story is very G rated and great for kids.  However, if you're looking for a game to showcase what the PS4 is capable of, this game doesn't come close to harnessing it's power.",3.0

"For being a ""stealth action"" game, it definately doesn't fail in what it's mainly designed to do... be a stealth game. The game does the stealth part extremely well, and I was very pleased with it.

However, all games are not perfect. So when it comes to the action part, although there are some parts of the game during combat and exploration that may get you frustrated and upset a few time, and also leave you scratching your head wondering where to go and what to do next, these issues are very few and very minor.  Once you figure things out (because the game demands that you do think about what you should do), you will feel good about yourself, and proud that you were able to figure your way through a level, and also, beat the game.

Overall, it's not a bad game.  I had a good time playing it, just as I did when I played other stealth action games like Splinter Cell, Metal Gear Solid, Batman Arkham City, The Chronicles of Riddick, and Beyond Good & Evil. It was fun to play, and there's always room for more stealth action games to be made, played, and enjoyed.",3.0

"I received this Logitech G230 Stereo Headset for free as part of Amazon Vine.  I think that the best endorsement I can make for the product is that I liked it so much I paid to get another set for my son.

This headset uses separate headphone and mic connections, not the USB connection as in other headsets.  The bad part is that make these a PC-only product and not compatible with Macs.  The good news is that this headset is extremely easy to set up and get running on a PC.  In fact, this headset for my son is going to be replacing a USB headset, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plantronics-GameCom-780-Surround-Sound-Stereo-PC-Gaming-Headset/dp/B00B1KJK22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plantronics GameCom 780 Surround Sound Stereo PC Gaming Headset</a>&nbsp;that I could never get working properly on his Dell PC.  Plugging my set of Logitech G230s into his PC, they immediately worked as expected.

I also like this headset because the earcups cover the ears without pinching them, they fit well but are not tight, and the controls are conveniently located a few feet away from the earcups on the cord.  As for the sound, it seems full and a bit bassy - perhaps not the best for serious music listening but just fine for gaming.  Also, no issues with the microphone so far.  In all these seems like a great PC headset for its price.

Edit December 2013 - lowering the rating by two stars because I have found the cord is too thin and too frail - it tangles very easily and one of the sets is now losing one of the sides intermittently.  I admit these headsets have taken a bit of abuse from the kids, but I think the cord should have held up a bit better than it has.",3.0

"When it has came down to Jeopardy!, it has definitely delivered as one of the most successful and challenging game shows of all time. The show created by the late, great  Merv Griffin still connects so strongly with younger generations and new gamers whom are seeking a higher level of vast knowledge for so many reasons, still get addicted to the simple Q&A challenges of everyday trivia. Yet, the show in its 27th season has had highs and record-breaking moments including the 2 highest-grossing winners in game show history, Brad Rutter & Ken Jennings, and won the most Emmy Awards for a game show ever. But, it also has had a few troubles with trying to have a definitive game for video game systems. It has a new era that has just arrived for the Nintendo Wii, but what is Jeopardy! in a Wii game? The answer might surprise you.

Jeopardy! for the Nintendo Wii brings out a nice, intimate challenge by bringing the interactive gameplay of Alex Trebek & Jeopardy's clue crew in a nice, interactive gameplay by having you play the game with you & 2 of your friends at home. The questions are absolutely challenging, and the gameplay is solid & strong, as you compete in the classic reigns of Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! & Final Jeopardy! rounds of gameplay. The interactivity with the clue crew questions and the gameplay is good, but the gameplay has a few downfaults in the answer of the form of a question. The main fault is in the use of the Wii Speak microphone. At times, it can make the gameplay interactive a bit more like the game show, but it can be hard for the game to interact comprehensively with your voice. It does lose a bit of the gameplay. The second disadvantage is seeing Alex & company as the Mii-like characters. It kind of feels a bit freaky when you look at it, compared to when you see him and the clue crew on TV. I also wish there could've been a lot more in the way of questions, that is just saying something compared to the 8,000 puzzles in the Wheel Of Fortune Wii title.

Nevertheless, those are small complaints though. Despite those few faults, Jeopardy! for the Nintendo Wii is still a strong game for anyone whom needs their need of Jeopardy! fix for the Nintendo age. I liked the interactivity at home, and it handles well as one of the few game shows to deliver as a video game in its own right for years. I hope there is a second edition of the game for the Wii, so it can fix some of the faults in the answer in the form of a question. Then, the answer for the Wii can be even more fun.

"The Playstation 3 era was a strange time for the Ratchet And Clank series. After seeing frequent full-fledged releases on the PS2, Ratchet and Clank on the PS4 largely consisted of shorter entries and spin off games focused on particular aspects of gameplay. There were only two full games released, Tools of Destruction and A Crack In Time. Those games introduced a story arc for the series, showing that the creators were willing to push the series. The last entry, Into The Nexus, not only only failed to wrap up that arc, it also had little to do with it in general. Because of that and other factors, I questioned if Ratchet & Clank was really a series that would benefit from a reboot. R&C never relied too heavily on continuity, but it had built up a nice supporting cast of characters.

Although the series experimented with different types of gameplay, most R&C games don't play that differently from each other. But this is the most by-the-numbers Ratchet & Clank game that's ever been released. Almost nothing about it is new. Almost all of the weapons are ones seen in previous games. Even the humorous ""Pixilizer"" functions exactly like the Blitz shotgun. We also have the series usual staples, such as grind rails, magboots, hidden gold bots, and crates full of bolts, with nothing being done to spice up the usual formula. Even taking into account that it's a reboot of the first game, many of the levels are far too similar in design to the ones seen in the first Ratchet & Clank game. The best thing the game does is add a few segments where you get to fight enemies while using a jetpack, something that's quite a bit of fun. A new kind of collectable are cards showcasing old weapons, characters and places, which at least helps to give respect to the games that preceeded this one. One thing I can praise the game about is adding a small sense of nonlinearity, sometimes giving you two different worlds to go to next, something the original sereis seemed to lose track of over time.

The story doesn't fare any better. Everything about the game is rushed, with no one element or character being fleshed out properly. Many complained about Ratchet having a bad attitude in the first game, but I always saw it as standard character development. In this game, him and Clank are best buddies the second they meet, and their bond feels unearned. Most of the old voice actors return, although Eric Bauza is a poor replacement for Kevin Michael Richardson, the original voice of Chairman Drek.

The game is certainly pretty, but that seems to be the only way the PS4's processing powers have been utilized. The levels are far too constrained, very small and practically on a tightrope. The environment has even less interactivity than the PS2 titles did. Nothing is done on a larger scale from the previous eras. I had my issues with the Ratchet and Clank Future series, but overall they did try to push the series forward in terms of scope and mechanics.

I can only hope that this game's problems are the result of making sure the game came out at around the same time as the movie, and that the next entry will get the series back on track. As it stands, Ratchet and Clank is a series that seems to regress with each new video game generation.",3.0
"This is just a complete little 5 hour package with a masterful dramatic drive that makes it all feel longer than it really is. In a good way. It has mysterious allies, some twists, and a heavily augmented super-soldier boss everyone keeps talking about on the ship.

I kept thinking about how seamlessly this mission would have fit the main game; the logs, e-books, conversations all make perfect sense (duh!) in terms of the big picture, and I think Eidos should have included it between the Hengsha and Singapore stages. The main game could sure have used the 5 extra hours.

There are unexpected little graphical touches that suggest some internal engine update, including the most spectacular depiction of a raging sea I've seen in a 3D game yet. There are more moving parts on the levels too: I recall seeing suspended cargo in a rocking net, and some canvas wrapping being blown by the wind. So everything feels less static than in all those office rooms of the main game.

On the bad side, this expansion is very short. Yet it does a great job making itself feel epic as it slowly builds up the tension to the final fight.
BUT then the final boss fight doesn't feel like a boss fight but like one of the many tougher generic fights from the main game. You'll see what I mean. Advice: bring at least one EMP grenade for the robot.

To sum up, Missing Link is an enjoyable boat ride, but there's the nagging feeling that it should have shipped with the main game in the first place. It's more of the same, plus some tiny graphical updates. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is ripe with DLC possibilities: what about Adam's life as a Detroit cop? His scandalous final mission at the DMPD? Or his first few weeks on Sarif's security team? I have high hopes for Eidos regarding future DLC's or even a full-length expansion pack. Give me Deus Ex, guys. I hope Missing Link was only a teaser yet.",3.0
I like this game because it is an adventure category game...I just wish it wasn't a nintendo game since it lacks graphics and the Wii only goes up to 480p screen resolution. which minimum HD is 720i. when the cut scenes happen you can tell right away that this game is not for special effects. other than that the story line is ok and the game play itself is decent with the different abilities you can do. the companion character that follows you on your missions is pretty helpful to since most of the time he will give you a hint of what to do if you click on his symbol to ask him.,3.0
"T.H.U.G is a great game don't get me wrong, the story is almost perfect, vehicals are a great idea create a trick is crazy and there are so many features in create a skater. but it's way to short i beat it in 3 days, the cool part was were you got to pick a label that you wanted to be on",3.0
"Puppeteer takes a great concept and story and creates an interesting world with finely-crafted artistic environments. However, the gameplay was quite diappointing given most of the action is done using the cutting action of scissors which requires constant button-mashing. Also, platforming has very little room for error which results in frequent dying and restarts. All in all, an ok game that did not quite fulfill its potential.",3.0
"Not as good as I hoped, same old dragon age.",3.0
"I was eager to buy this game because it was a mystery and based on a novel by Agatha Christie.  However, I've been slightly disappointed.

This game reminds me a lot of Clue: Fatal Illusion that came out years ago and was supposed to be the first in a series a clue games, that we never saw, as this is supposed to be a series a Agatha Christie games.

I played this game after finishing the Syberia Series and the latest Nancy Drew.  Needless to say, the graphics don't compare to either, you don't have anything stunning like Syberia and it's not as nicely done as in ND series.

Graphics:

It's very rough around the edges graphics, an the people are chunky/blocky and move stiff.  There is way too much to the island and half of the scenes you walk through serve no purpose but to see gloomy/cloudy/rainy and boring scenery.

Movement:

The character can never hit the door handle for instance; he seems to reach somewhere to the left or right of it.  When it comes to going up or down steps, the character kind of walks in thin air for a moment and he is very slow.

Scenes:

The fade scenes can be long and drawn out, with totally unnecessary information, and you cannot click through them, so it gets boring fast.

Puzzles:

The puzzles/tasks are either very easy or totally obscure.  In some ""chapters"" (there are 10) all you do is walk around and make sure the occupants of the house are asleep, boring... and in others all you do is ask them questions, every single one of them.  Some of the puzzles make absolutely no sense at all, it's like the writers just took random objects, threw them together, and decided that was the solution for whatever problem.  Most of the puzzles don't do anything useful for the game at all.

Music/Sound:

The music is the same thing over and over and over.  The sound effects are mostly birds and rain.

Plot:

The plot is good, probably because it's based on a book, which is about the only thing that is keeping me interested at this point, to see ""whodunit"".  The game claims you can have multiple endings, but I'm not really sure how you trigger them.

I have not finished the game and I've had to look up only a few hints, for the obscure solutions, but so far I'm bored.  The game seems to be pretty long, which is usually good, but when you're doing seemingly useless tasks that do not help at all, it gets old fast.

If you like mysteries and you're a beginner gamer, then it's a good game, if you don't mind all the clicking here and there and everywhere or the totally insane puzzle solutions.  If your looking for a high graphic game where everything seems lifelike, forget it, you won't find it here.  If you're a seasoned adventure gamer and have played Syberia, etc. and solved really hard puzzles, this will be a breeze.  I'm playing it for the storyline now, which is pretty good, but it's a game I'll be quick to sell when I'm done.  If they continue the series, I would buy them for the sake that they are a murder mystery/adventure, but I hope they will improve the games in the next releases.",3.0
"A perfectly competent game from a gameplay perspective, completely ruined by its performance. With an i7 4790K/GTX980/16GB DDR3 this game should run great at 1080p, but still struggles hard to maintain 60 fps, and even then there's artifacting and strange bugs, people falling out of the sky, into the ground. Black Flag was bad too, but at least playable, this one is borderline playable. It's a shame too since the modern sci-fi segments of the game where your character gets warped into some future dimension are some of the most interesting parts of the game.",3.0

"This game is a large improvement over Raw. The graphics are better, the wrestlers are more realistic to thier real life counterparts. Once you get the hang of how the moves work it's pretty cool. I haven't figured out everything or gotten into playing it smooth without my wrists huritng from button tapping, but so far so good. I would expect more for the Xbox. Why are they leaving out all the good stuf for the PS2. This game is missing commentary and blood and you can beat the hell out of your opponent and they don't even look like they've been touched.
Doing an F-5 through the top of the cage in hell in a cell was fun though. I rented it so i don't have the manual to know how to do everything but so far it seems pretty cool and maybe worth the money. Either way it's a VAST improvement from Raw for us Xbox owners. I don't care that Stone Cold is not the GM or Kane has his mask on BIG whoopdie Doo. I want fun game play and smooth controls and maybe once i play it more it'll get smoother. What's funny is that an old WCW game i had was so much easier and smoother controller wise and move wise then this, guess i just need time to adjust to the controls. So for now it gets 3 stars. THQ should have put blood and bodily and facial damage as you get bet up. Commentary by the King and Lawler would have been really cool.",3.0
I only played this game for a little bit I kept getting stuck on some levels but other than that was a good game with good graphics,3.0
"The game itself is great. The story, while not told very well, is interesting. The action is fantastic. I only give this 3 stars because without Xbox live, you lose access to about a third of the game's missions. Not only that, without those missions you'll hit a glass wall where you can't get better equipment or level up anymore. This feels like punishment for not paying for other services that should have nothing to do with the game. It feels like you paid to play a full game but they only gave you %66 of it unless you pay a monthly ransom. Not to mention the fact that with the Iron Banner expansion, X360 people are completely shut out.

So, in short: great game, horrible mission access/delivery, even worse treatment of people in X360. I wish they released it on PC so I'm not left out of the community, but if this is how Bungie is going to do this... I voluntarily choose to not play anymore.",3.0
While I  can be counted among the Harvest Moon Junkies I have to say that this one left me dissapointed. If this is your first time playing a harvest moon game please do not judge the whole series on this one game. Try the other ones first which are much more in depth. The game play/story line seemed cold *maybe because you are a robot?) I just could not connect with any of the characters and you do not interact the same way ( no marriage or family you live alone).The town seemed small and the amount of people in town seemed to be few. Shrug.,3.0
"I got this as a gift for christmas 2015, started it in March in preparation for 4.  I'm new to the series and had 4 pre ordered since it looked stunning and my friends had been raving about the series for years.

First off the story line is fantastic, Im a fan of history and these types of story(refrences) lines get me excited but obviously no ones going to get a real history lesson from the 3 games.  The gunplay is ok at best, my complaint is that the weapons don't have enough variety.  One semi auto pistol feels and hits the same as the other and the same with assault rifles, sniper rifles, RPGs, a semi auto grenade launcher and a few more make a appearance and are much more fun to use but the base pistols, ar, shottys...etc just don't really do it for me.  Like the last of us, you always get just enough ammo and theres almost always another weapon to pick up so don't get attached to one weapon.  I found myself forced to switch between different types of weapons throughout a firefight based on the enemy type that was spawning.

While the story was awesome the actual gameplay and mechanics left me irked half the time.  Seriously who's the genius that thought blindly running forward while stuff/things chase you would be fun?  You cant see corners in front of you so the only real way to beat these (short)instances are to die a few times and feel your way through.  The controls are clunky as all hell, but it gets better as the series moves along.  Control problems include pointing 1 direction and then having your character jump in a different direction...usually off a cliff or left if right in some instances and vice versa its just a mess.  Being able to use surrounding objects like a fish or chair in combat was a nice addition to the third game.

If it wasn't to get caught up on the storyline for 4 I wouldn't have bothered.  My favorite story was probably the second one playing through the first one was a test of patience and will for me, two and three were much more enjoyable.  I don't know if its just me but I cant stand the main character, I thought he was poorly constructed and just not very likable.

Overall, I had fun playing through the 3 games but don't see myself repeating any of them in the near future.

"Medal of Honor: Frontline was and still is one of my favorite games. When I got this game, I was hoping for the same thing with larger levels, more weapons, better graphics, ect. I found almost all of these things in Rising Sun, but most of these features came with a not so great oppisite. The levels were much larger, but there were very few of them. The levels are also on a track for the most part. You just follow the little path through jungles or go down the only street that isn't blocked by rubble. The only sense of freedom I ever got in this game was in a part of a level where you have to run up a hill to take out an artillary emplacement. Wow! You can go up the hill on the left or right side! The number of weapons was increased, but you can only use two different Japanese guns. Also, you can only use one kind of grenade. The attack on Pearl harbor level is more of an obstical course than it is a battle. You run around inside the ship ducking under loose pipes, jumping over holes in the floor and putting out fires. Then you go up on deck and start shooting at planes. The first time through the game is fun and I still like to play through it with my friends in two player co-op. This is a good game for WWII FPS fans who don't have huge expectations for it.",3.0

"The graphics and gameplay are awesome. It was addictive for the first 12 hours of play. Then it got old real quick. You do the same thing over and over again. The enemies change slightly as you progress, but the scene is the same. There is no storyline. There is really no challenge or puzzles to solve. All you do is kill enemies and locate PDAs. What I also find annoying is the constant darkness, where you have to use a flash light to spot almost anything. It gets old. Overall I do recommend playing this game just to see the graphics. You will love this game at least the first several hours you play it.",3.0

"This game is not well liked among fans of the series and so I never bought it because I didn't want to end up wasting my money (ND fans are rarely wrong when it comes to which games are good and which are not) but I ended up buying this game because it was on sale. I figured that for $3 it was worth seeing if my fellow fans were right or not. Turns out they were. This game was pretty bad. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 2/5: It will be hard for me to describe this plot because honestly Im not really sure what was going on. There were a few different storylines happening that eventually got mashed together in a clumsy mess that apparently was supposed to be a mystery.

Nancy has found a summer job working as a research assistant to an entomologist (bug scientist) in Hawaii. Coincidentally Frank and Joe Hardy are on assignment in the exact same area as Nancy. Frank and Joe have been asked to do some undercover investigating on a surfer named Pua Mapu and her father, Big Island Mike, for a company that is considering endorsing her as professional surfer. Also, a sketchy research facility has been doing top secret plant experiments that many believe are making the islands pineapple population sick. On top of all of this there is apparently an ancient monster named Kane Okala who is upset about the sick pineapples and now is going around destroying everything. Is it not making sense yet? Dont worry, it never will.

This plot was so awful. Thats not to say that the game wasn't fun at times but I really cant believe that Her Interactive would release a game with so weak of a plot. The one strong point that I think this game had was the ability to switch between Nancy and the Hardy Boys, I thought that was a lot of fun. But other than that there was nothing that stood out, leaving a short and stumbling storyline that didn't impress me at all.

CHARACTERS - 3/5: The characters in this game were interesting although none of them were very likeable. I think that more character development would have gone a long way in this game. The characters included Big Island Mike, a shady man who runs a shady vacation business. Mikes daughter Pua, a surfer who was nice but pretty boring. Nancys boss, Quigley Kim, who was quirky and kind of funny at times but had an annoying nasally voice (reminded me of Chandlers girlfriend Janice on Friends). And Malacahi Craven, a scientist at the Hilihili Research Facility who has some serious anger issues but for whatever reason he takes an instant liking to Nancy. Of course there was Frank and Joe Hardy, but it annoyed me that they made Frank and Joe look so different than they did in Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon. Last Train was only 2 games prior to this one so it was silly to have the Hardy Boys look completely different. I also didn't like that they changed the voice actor for Frank.  As far as phone friends go, Nancy could call Ned, but poor Ned spent the whole game being sulky and jealous that Nancy was with Frank.

SETTING - 3/5: Visually, the setting was beautiful. It was all very pretty to look at and I could appreciate the fact that the graphics would have been fairly cutting edge at the time this game came out. I also really liked the music. There wasn't a whole lot to explore, though  a handful of different areas in the jungle and Big Island Mikes small Immersion Excursion center closer to the shore. The beach area in the game was pitifully small  only 3 clicks long. We had way more beach access in Danger on Deception Island and that was a foggy Northern Pacific beach. I don't know why Her Interactive chose to make the shore so small especially when a lot of time in the game is spent fishing and collecting shells.

PUZZLES  3.5/5: I actually didn't mind the puzzles in this game. They weren't hard but they weren't necessarily fun or exciting either. At least they weren't puzzles that were repeats from other ND games.  I know that Im the minority here, but I had fun collecting shells and making necklaces and fishing to make money.  Overall the puzzles weren't great but they were probably the strongest aspect of the game.

IS IT CHALLENGING?:  No. I got through 90% on my own without a walkthrough. I did have to use the walkthrough a couple of times just to figure out what to do next in the story. For whatever reason Ned stopped giving me hints very early on in the game. I don't know if this was a glitch or what. Id give it a 2.5 for challenge.

ENDING - 1/5: Terrible. One of the worst endings Ive had in a ND game. It was way too abrupt. I felt like I was nowhere near the end of the story when suddenly the culprit was revealed. And the puzzle at the end was a stupid randomized puzzle that took me several attempts to solve. I think that even Her Interactive realized that this was a horrible ending because Nancy went into overdrive trying to explain everything in the epilogue. Even with the epilogue this was a disappointing ending to an overall disappointing game.

"Resident Evil 4 is a title that helped define modern gaming. It practically created the ""over-the-shoulder"" view that's taken for granted these days, among many, many other things. But the thing is that, despite it still being a fun game to go back to, it hasn't aged super well. Sure, the art direction, narrative, and overall atmosphere are all top-notch, but the mechanics introduced have been improved upon several times over in the decade-plus since its initial release.

I bring this title up because, despite those mechanics not particularly holding up, Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls sees fit to ape them wholesale and throw them, clumsily, into a franchise that really ought to never be a shooter.

We've seen this ""make it a shooter"" done with some franchises before, and, generally speaking, it tends to not work out. The first example that comes to mind is Yakuza: Dead Souls, in which Sega decided to take a beat-em-up franchise and morph it into a lackluster shooter. And now, we see Spike-Chunsoft taking their excellent series of visual novel/rhythm/??? games and crash it into shooting mechanics straight out of 2004. The result is exactly what it sounds like: mediocre and uncalled for.

At least the narrative is up to snuff. Players take the role of the first Danganronpa's protagonist's little sister, Komaru, as she's kidnapped and thrown into a city run by murderous children. Their goal? Kill every adult in order to create a perfect kids-only utopia. They accomplish this by wielding an army of robotic MonoKuma (the series' ""antagonist,"") which they use to murder, loot and destroy everything they can find. Komaru ends up catching afoul of these kids and is forced to fight for her life as each kid systemically hunts her down as part of a twisted ""game."" Can Komaru escape alive, even with the help of fan favorite serial killer/smut writer Toko? Will the kids ever realize that their plan is really stupid? Who knows?

In all seriousness, this narrative is pretty tight. It's absurd, wrong, funny and scary in all the right amounts, which is pretty much par for the course for the franchise at this point. Making light of horrible things, making benign things seems terrifying... all that is here in spades. Despite an overabundance of cutscenes and weird, conflicting art styles, the story is told in a compelling, interesting way. In fact, the narrative is the main reason I keep coming back to the game, even knowing the slog I'm in for.

I say ""slog"" because that's exactly what Another Episode is: a slog. The narrative is pretty much the only saving grace here, and it's precisely because of how good it is that I'm not more jaded about this whole thing. Simply put, the gameplay is a hot mess. No, actually, that's being really nice. It's a straight-up mess. The shooting mechanics are lifted wholesale from the original Resident Evil 4, before it was improved upon with subsequent releases, and the result is a clunky, unfun, simplistic series of bright corridors devoid of any variety and (most importantly) lacking any real sense of fun.

Sure, you can point and shoot, but it's slow, and the hitboxes for the enemies are ridiculously unclear. The game tells you a shot in a certain area will instantly kill a MonoKuma, but then several shots don't do anything... only for one shot in a totally different region to TKO one of them. This doesn't help when the enemies are often less than body length away from you. You frantically try to hit a certain area, watching the reticle slowly drag across your OLED (or LED if you have that new Vita,) only for that area to not do jack and you take a hit. Only not, because the enemy AI is offensively stupid. Sometimes they'll hit you, sometimes they'll just chase you and bumble around. The only times I've actually died are from cheap shots and lack of control of my character. All of this, coupled with some absolutely garbage level design, makes for a clunky, dated, unfun shooter that actually makes me want to play a Gears of War clone. Yeah, that bad.

At least the other stuff is nice. The visuals are quite impressive for the Vita, with no jagged edges to speak of, and aided by a colorful art direction. Sometimes, there are jarring drops in frame rate, but that's pretty rare, and even then, it doesn't really disrupt the gameplay. Despite aforementioned art direction clashes, everything in the cutscene department is uniformly pretty and does the series' signature aesthetics absolute justice. Rounded off by a really great soundtrack (despite some blatant music recycling from past games,) the A/V department of Another Episode makes it feel just like another Danganronpa game.

Which I wish it was, because what we have instead is part fun Danganronpa romp (Danganrompa...?), part abhorrent bargain-bin shooter with a stupid gimmick. Oh, wow, you have one gun that does different things! And it looks like a megaphone! How novel! But no, it's horrid. The shooting is unacceptable for a game released in 2015, especially when the Vita has been used to make some really good shooters before. ""But it's a twist on shooters,"" you say. ""It's unfair to compare it to other ones!"" Nope. You point and shoot. It's a shooter. And a super, super bad one. One that actually plunges me into despair.

You might notice that I'm still giving Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls three stars, and that's because the narrative is really, really great. Without it, I'd probably give it a one-star and call it a day. But because of how good it is, and how vital it is the overall canon of the series, and how stylistically charming everything is, I can't help but recommend this game... to series diehards. Everyone else is better served playing the visual novels and leaving this in the dust.

Pros:
- The narrative is excellent.
- Visuals are arresting.
- Sound direction is on-point.

Cons:
- Everything else, including the lackluster dub.

"Having enjoyed Sonic Advance I was eager to get my hands on Sonic Rush. With brilliant graphics and the fastest gameplay yet in a Sonic game it sure does make for a great video-game experience. But there's just not enough of it and not much is made of the Nintendo DS potential outside of some slight touch-screen interaction and a tall graphics.

As always the levels range from tropical islands to mechanical metropolis with all the usual powers ups, springs and speed barriers. They are brilliantly designed and contain so many loop-the-loops and massive jumps that you'll go cock-eyed. The sheer speed that you can fire through the levels is amazing. The music top-notch too and there are loads of cool tunes.

You can play as Sonic, with his usual abilities, or as Blaze the Cat, who has her own mission opposite Sonic. Obviously this involves defeating Doctor Eggman, but you now have a 'rush' ability which acts as a booster to make Sonic or Blaze go even faster.

My major complaint is with the Special Stages. They are the same as the were in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, involving the 3D tunnels. And they are impossible. The one that I actually managed to enter requires 160 rings to catch the Chaos Emerald. Not only do I not think there were even 160 IN the whole stage but it's impossible to keep a hold of them as there are so many dangerous obstacles and traps. Plus, you control Sonic with the stylus pen in this stage and it's not got such a great response.

And the last boss is impossible also. There is no way to defeat Doctor Eggman and the controls frequently contradict each other, it's all down to bad programming. The game sure has a few bugs (nothing major) that should have been sorted out.

So apart from the special stage and the final boss, the game is just too damn easy and has nothing to bring you back for more. Yes, I had loads of fun playing it but it would be only worth the money if it were longer and had more to it.

"It's finally here, Ghostbusters The Video Game! I've waited over a year for this game and I could have waited anther year. The game is fun when you get use to the controls but it could have had some improvements. The pros and cons of this game have the cons winning, here are some flaws

First off, it's a DS system. There are no speaking parts like bigger systems have but some music from the original film can be heard sprinkled thru the game. Also, the actual Ghostbusters song can be heard when driving. The map is on top of the screen, rather then action on top and map on the bottom. I haven't played it alot but i'm pretty sure you cannot switch them around. The driving of Ecto 1 is horrible and you can see some glitches when getting to a mission. Anther thing is they time you to a mission and the map is not well made, so it'll take a few times before you get where your going. Shooting a trap is easy but its getting the ghost to go in thats the tricky part. The last thing i'll say is the characters look somewhat like the Hollywood actors but Slimer looks nothing like the real deal. I've got to the mission of Stay Puft but have yet to see how he looks. The game on DS seems to take alot from the Sega system.

The pros of the game is the ghost do look cool. I hate using the stylus but shooting the proton packs is alot of fun. Other then that, i've got to play a little more. Right now, the game is fun but far from the best game i've played on DS.",3.0
"This game was definitely hyped up and these reviews of perfect 10's are completely incorrect. The game itself, like most people have mentioned, plays out like far cry/tomb raider/ whatever else open world game. HZD does not really differentiate itself from others, instead using recycled open world gameplay formula.
  I honestly believe people are just saying it's perfect cause the graphics and the fact it looks like a how a game made in 2017 should be. The graphics are really great with HDR and 4k, assuming you have the ps4 pro and hdr tv. The lighting looks fantastic and the detail is quit amazing. I really don't see any flaws with the graphics at all to be honest.
  Just because the graphics are great doesn't make it the best however. The open world itself is big enough, however, it's just so empty. Besides the map pointing out where any ""hidden"" collectable may be, there is absolutely no reason to explore. It's too bad considering how good the environment looks. Many times you will want to wonder off thinking theres something there only to find nothing at all, maybe just some dino robots. There is no sense of reward for exploration, just nice looking scenery.
  The combat was decent; not terrible and not thrilling. You're given many options of combat, however, arrows are really the only thing you may need. Theres traps, tripwires, ropecaster (good for flying things) but arrows were the only thing i really even needed. Theres many differnt types of those too but I only needed the ""damage"" arrows"". Once i discovered that you can freeze them with ice arrows, the damage arrows make it much pretty easy to take down the most intimidating robots. So ice/damage was all i needed. Even the armor had 3 classes: common, rare, very rare. I only needed one type of armor to survive, that being the last of each tier. Stealth wasn't needed very often, maybe for sneak attack, but you could easily go up to humans or some robots and start slashing away with your spear.
  The story was also just decent i found. You really are left wondering until kind of towards the end. Until then, you're just assuming it's an apolyctic world in which it's back to the ""Stone Age/ Tribe"" setting but with robotic dinosaurs? theres a war going on the first half so i find it didn't catch my attention at all until you explore the ""metal world"" or the old labs of humanity. There you find out what really happens and the story begins to pull you in. However, at the end (no spoilers), it gets pretty confusing and unbelievable. There are some nice twists though (especially the ending) and it does pull you in for a little while.
  The missions are not very fun though. The main missions are typical go here, kill that, learn piece of story. Nothing great. The side missions are just plain terrible. There's no reason to even follow the story of them as it's not exciting. You usually use your sense thing to follow a trial and look for someone or kill something. That is it. No reason to care just go here and come back. I really can't think of a single mission that was cool or rememberable. That's about it for missions.
  Lastly are the characters. Aloy is a decent character and nicely voiced by whomever. The other tribes can have nice voice acting but you really have little to care for these characters. The main characters in the story itself are pretty bland and really have no reason to care for most of them. You will meet a few who tie in the story altogether but serve little purpose to really care for them. You see them for a little while on screen and get introduced to another and tie in at the end. Not too much back story to really care and could care who lives or die in these tribes. The side missions, again, are even worse. There is no reason to give a shit about them or whatever they want. Looking for someone, piece of equipment, no reason at all to care. In fact, the real shame is the lifeless towns and the people who inhabit it. Theres a merchant, maybe a boring side quest or two, and that's it. Nothing else. People walk around and there's no interaction so may as well all be ghost towns. That really pulls away from the immersion. The holograms you see of the human world in the past, however, is pretty interesting towards the ends.
  All in all, i would give the game a 7/10. It was entertaining, but once you're done, you're done. You are left with a feeling of ""OK, that was entertaining on to the next thing."" maybe 60 hours to get the platinum trophy, which would be 100% completion. It was mostly enjoyable while it lasted but was ready for it to end towards the end. In time, people will look back and not care too much i think. It will be remembered for a great looking PS exclusive title one day and that's about it. HZD is basically a knock off of Far Cry with robot dinosaurs so if you're looking for something different, this is not it. If you don't mind the same typical formula and nice graphics, you will probably be entertained.",3.0
"There are many things to like about this game and there are somethings that will annoy the fans. The Konquest mode on this game is definitely the best out of the three we have seen so far (Deadly Alliance, Deception and Armageddon). You play Taven, a half god that has to complete a quest that he doesn't know about or Armageddon will destroy Earthrealm. Konquest mode was really well done and the story is addicting and very interesting. No longer do you have to learn tedious combos to progress through the game. That is a big plus.

It is really great to see all of the characters on the arcade mode. There are a few flaws here that may make fans angry. One thing being that the individual fatalities are gone. Now it is just random button pushing that causes different things to happen (rip off arms, legs, heads and so on). Another problem is that when you beat the game, the end story is told only by a voice and the only thing you see is your character performing martial arts moves (katas) on top of the pyramid.

So, overall, there are things on here that will make a lot of fans happy. There are also a lot of things that will make fans angry. I still say it is worth buying. Having all of those characters to choose from to play makes up for where the game lacks.",3.0
"I got this game, because I thought it would be cool to play. I watch TNA wrestling and I am a huge fan. It only seemed right for me to get the game and try that as well. However the game isn't that great. It has hardly know characters to choose from. The moves are almost impossible to do unless you play all day everyday Not to pleased with the game. In fact it just sits there and I don't play it. However none of this is the sellers fault. The game came quickly and it was nice and cheap. Just not a great game is all.",3.0

"I started playing this game but haven't gotten around to finishing it yet.  Never played the multi-player so I can't comment on that aspect of the game.  The AI is fairly smart and the dialogue is cool, but it isn't nearly as impressive or engaging as NOLF.  Some games I play for a while and then get bored with them and tossed them out.  Not sure yet if RTCW will fall into that category.",3.0
"It's a good feel in the hand and the tracking is smooth- usually. Every so often it bugs out really bad with no matter how smooth I move across my mouse pad it will show a jerking motion as i'm playing cs:go. Also, the adhesive from the front right shoe of the mouse is straight up just coming off so the shoe is just chipping away slowly. I have about 3/4 of that shoe left. I've only had this mouse at 9 months at the most. The texture on the side is super worn where my thumb sits, but that is somewhat expected.  I used my mx518 from logitech for 3 years and it still works so i'm going back to that. Can't return or RMA this either because I don't still have my receipt ((cuz who keeps a receipt for almost a year, should have scanned and uploaded it somewhere)). be warned this was great at first, but long term did not last for me.",3.0
"This game is based on the movie 'Barnyard' and you play a new cow who enters a farm and befriends other animals by doing tasks for them and partying with them. There is a huge farm in which you can roam around and as in many other games, you gain access to different areas as you complete 'missions', some of them as dumb as just finding stuff around, as fun as squirting milk on other animals and targets and as active as mud jumping, bike races, chicken chase or apple shooting. None of the missions are seriously challenging, but quiet a few are fun for kids and beginners. If you are a serious action gamer, stay away from this game.

Some cons:
- The voice for characters is poorly done. They speak only the first sentence and the rest you have read by pushing the A button. I didn't like this and neither did my five year old.
- I think the controls could have been better or more options be given. For simple actions performed in this game, it is a bit too much to use both the wiimote and the nunchuck. There is no option (atleast that i know of) to use just the wiimote analog controls which would have been less strenuos on the little kid's hands.

Over all, it is a fun game for the price!",3.0
"not the best, not the worst game i have played this year. the campaign is the best in the series in a long time. the mp is such a copy paste of BO3 it's unreal. time for this series to be revamped or retire.

"I was expecting this to be the old front loader instead of just having a lid that the user opens and closes.  I wonder how long before the 5 and 6 years break it.  Also, the kids have played the lego starwars for a lot of hours and keep wanting the new lego batman so after the first ps2 broke and it was xmas, well the choice was obvious. But they only played the batman lego for a few hours before they wanted a different game so it's certainly not a great upgrade from the starwars version I guess.  But the price was awesome and there was no way I was going to get them an xbox for twice as much after they broke the first ps2.",3.0
"Ok, I have had the Wii U Deluxe Set for sometime (3 months).  It didn't give me the same WOW factor the original Wii did.  The tablet controller is the ""star"" of this new console.  The graphics are on par with the PS3 and Xbox 360.  The lag in load time on the Wii U is confusing to me however.  I have been playing Black Ops 2 on my Wii U and my friends Xbox 360.  They look exactly the same but the load times on the Wii U take far longer than the Xbox 360. Too me I feel like I wasted my money.  Not because it's not worth the price, but it simple doesn't make since to have one if you have a PS3 or Xbox 360.  I have also had more lock-ups and freezing with the Wii U than with any other system I have owned.  Think that will be patched and fixed in the future so hopefully that a temporary problem. The BEST part of this console really is the controller.  When my girlfriend is watching TV I can play right off the tablet.  To me this is the only advantage the Wii U has over the PS3 and Xbox 360. At least at the moment.  Time will tell how the tablet will be used on future games.

The GOOD:
1- Can game right off the controller (no TV required)
2- Fair price for what your getting
3- Mario in HD is honestly a childhood dream come true
4- Small console takes up very little space
5- HD graphics on a Nintendo console was long overdue

The BAD:
1- Limited WOW factor
2- Long load times/ Slow updates
3- Not a powerful leap over PS3 or Xbox 360
4- Short battery life in tablet controller
5- Freezing and lock-ups are frustrating (must unplug console to reset!)

Summary:  I currently feel the Wii U is great for someone who doesn't own a PS3 or Xbox 360.  I believe the console will be successful but at the moment limited games and some tech issues leave me wanting more out of the Wii U. If the sales of the Wii U pick-up (and I think they will) the unique games and use of the tablet controller will set this console apart from whatever Sony or Microsoft come up with later this year.",3.0

I say this because i did not enjoy this game.  But in fairness it is a good ""boxing"" game.

"First let me say that I HATE turn based games! This is mainly because I play single player most of the time. If I had a friend to play against instead of just the AI maybe I would change my mind but I doubt it. I bought this game hoping it WOULD change my mind but alas no. With all the hype and glorious attributes touted for this game it should have knocked my socks off. At first it does intrigue,but then the flaws begin to appear. The AI is much too agressive and takes unfair advantage. The resources you need to build certain units are controlled by the very same unfair AI making diplomacy almost useless by the outrageous demands it makes and refuses to budge from. Cheats would be the only way I see to get on balance with the AI unless Sid&co deem to release a patch to level this out. Like many others I would like to see some personalization of one's own characters instead of everything Sid. I gave it an extra star for the historical content and teaching potential the game posseses but I would not recomend it as a ""fun"" game unless you're a big fan of the series. Look elsewhere for the ""just 1 more clik"" feeling,such as Age of Empires or Empire Earth. I had no problems with crashes or lockups on my machine(PIII 1ghz. GF3),code is good&no graphical glitches seen. Doesn't live up to it's potential.",3.0
"Amazing Adventures: The Lost Tomb, by PopCap, is a hidden object game without a storyline. I found it tedious, but we are all different, so I'll list my reasons to better help potential buyers:

1. The fast beat, repetitious music loop is the same throughout the entire game. It doesn't change from scene to scene.

2. There is absolutely no animation, character interaction, dialog or story. You simply click a map location and find a dozen objects in a two dimensional setting. Then you go to an easy puzzle, work that out, and then go back to the map for your next hidden object location.

3. There are only 4 kinds of puzzles, despite what the product discription reads: ""Jigsaws"" with less than 30 pieces, ""Find the Matches"" (grouped by same colors, or objects that function together, or exact duplicates), ""Find the Differences"" where two exact pictures have 6 differences, and ""Swap the Tiles Around to Make a Picture.""

4. The game reuses locations over and over and over with the hidden object games, the tile games, and the find the differences games.

5. As soon as you correctly place the last tile swap or jigsaw piece in a puzzle, the picture is covered with a strip telling you where you are heading next, and you don't get a chance to see the picture completed.

Now for the good points:

1. The hidden objects are very challenging to find.
2. The Hint button recharges in only a few seconds.
3. Bonus points are given at each level for not using a hint.
4. There is a hidden scarab beetle to find in each scene.
5. There is a timed mode or relaxed mode option.
6. There is a free play mode when the game is completed.

I like games to have animation, such as rain, falling leaves, fire, moving creatures, and so forth. I like a riveting story or mystery. I like character interaction--at least a little. And I like changing scenery with a more 3D feel. So I was disappointed with this game.",3.0
This game started out fun but then just got repetitive and felt like it was never going to end. Most of the missions were the same thing over and over so it got boring quick. There were too many side missions that were also pretty much the same. I got so bored with this game I couldn't wait until it was over. If there is a sequel I will pass on playing it.,3.0
"I think I can agree with the rest of the reviewers that this is the better of tennis games for Playstation 2.  I have not played Top Spin though.  Anyway, Smash Court 2 is very fun to play, it gets your competitive juices flowing, but this game is very difficult to win matches on - even on the easy level.  I don't think I suck at this game or at video games in general.  I find the player movement on screen is often not as fast as I would like in order to get to the ball. Now I am not an avid real tennis player as it seems from a lot of the other reviewers that they are, and it these people that appreciate this game the most.  So perhaps this is why I find this game so hard.",3.0
"Good game by the folks at Konami.  However, I did feel that many times, running from place to place became very excessive and boring.  Nice psychological thriller.

"We bought a PS3 for Christmas for my twelve year old son.  We got Resistance 2, Rachet and Clank, Motor Storm and Indiana Jones temple of doom.  Resistance and Rachet are a blast and I past them both within weeks.  Indiana Jones was to kiddish for me (I'm 30), so this left me playing Motor Storm because I couldn't afford to buy another game.  I ended up passing every race.  I would race until I eventually took first place which would allow me to close out the ticket.  The reason I bring this up is because I have alot of hours playing this game.  It took me along time before I was able to beat it.
The good and the bad:
First the good;
1.  Great Graphics
2.  You can race as a motorcycle, 4-Wheeler, race car, 4x4 truck, buggie, and semi.
3.  Hours of ""fun"" or ""torture"" trying to pass the game.

The bad;
1.  This game has absolutely no story line and the ending sucks!
2.  you race the same tracks over and over again, which get's really boring.
3.  Poor artificial intellegence.  You can race and never wipe out and the cars will still be riding your butt, or you can race and wipe out all the time and guess what, the cars will still be riding your butt.  This gets real frustrating after awhile.  I expect to lose a race and have cars all around me if I race crappy, but when I race good I expect to leave the other cars in the dust.
4.  Some of the races are extremely easy, while others are very difficult.  For example, the second to last race took me about twenty tries before I could finally beat it in first place.  The last race, which one would expect to be the hardest, only took two tries.  I actually would have beat it the first time, but I did a stupid move and wiped out before the finish line.
  Overall this is a game that ""could"" have had alot of potential because of the vehicles and good graphics.  It's to bad they didn't incorporate a story line, better AI and lot's more tracks to race.",3.0

okay okay this game wasn't the best but sure wasn't the worst i admit i was quite entertained when playing it the reason i gave it 3 stars was because sometimes it gotten boring where i did not want to play it and on top of that it was easy like all super hero games in my opinion this game would most likely make a great rental but if you want to buy then don't waste your cash but for me being a critic i give this adventure 3 stars enjoy i hope they make sequels,3.0
"""You look modified."" may be the coin word of the millenium like Robot was in the last one. Nanotechnologies and holograms dominate the future throughout. The game is a sequel that continues 20 years in the future with Alex D the ""clone"" trainee. You can be male or female with 3 choices of skin color. The game has great potential to be a cult classic and in some cases it is but the slow load times and scarce ammo just kills it for me. The graphics are good but are better on the PC versions compared to the Xbox. Bugs regarding freeze frames are fixed in the Xbox version however, the box still stalls if play over a 6 hour period requiring a ""reboot"" as it did with me. There are 4 ways to go depending on which side you choose. I seen 2 endings so far. I played the game on default normal and is in reference to that level. The AIs' are good when they are the enemy but as a source of information they can be stupid. Leo in the end was a complete idiot after taking out a faction; questioning Alex D's courage. He becomes useless. I just can't get him to attack anybody else so I kill him for his grenade. NG Resonance is funny and informative in the Air terminal.  Little ammo is the main problem I have with the game. I'm totally rationing it throughout the game. Why does it take ""2"" head shots to kill with a sniper rifle after weapons mods?  The advance rail gun is a joke on organic targets. Totally ineffective against even minimum armoured opponents. I can upgrade my Bi-Mods for hacking systems, strength increase, regeneration etc. I don't want to give much away except that the main ending won't please Star Trek fans-- unless it's the foundation for a sequel.  After a week of playing, I only get a 15 second ending. I'm playing it a second time as a female and for the start I'm searching for ammo even before I had a weapon.  Selecting the right weapon and bi-mod to activate for any given situation can be tedious at times. There is an easter egg regarding a flag in the UNATCO ruins. In the ""Dance Room"", there's chat logs from the developers about 14 data pads in all. What a bunch of characters!! Is this why there's problems with the game? There's only one way to the VIP Booth in the Easter egg without a key and you're going to have to jump from the speaker boxes to get it. There's nothing there but a good view. On the Xbox, I had to wait 15 seconds between scenes and when I die. Those seconds add up even if the screen displayed hints during the load. In game time, I spend 24 hours. That's about 4.5 days in real time. I was reduced to doing ""room clearing"" and info gathering like I did in the military. Your actions don't really matter much up to that ""point"" when you have to take a side. It doesn't matter who you kill. There are only 3 or 4 main ones that determines the outcome of the game. Still it's good game with all the limitations. I really hated where the ending was going and it wasn't what I would call a happy ending. Could have been a great game with more beta testing and a rewrite. I'm glad I got my copy in the ""Red Tag"" bin for a ""Lincoln""!!!!",3.0

"This is same type of AV cable that came bundled with the SNES, N64, and Nintendo Gamecube. The build quality is of course the best you'll probably find if it's an official Nintendo product, however I would highly recommend buying the S-Video version of this cable. Even if you can only find 3rd party cables, you won't regret purchasing one, as the video signal will drastically increase compared to composite. Two leads on the S-Video cable carry analog color and contrast information to your display, while composite video does this on one lead. The result is a much sharper image (just look on youtube for comparisons. S-Video has very little pixel bleeding, while composite video blends the colors together, producing a very poor image).",3.0

the good-

big levels

the bad-

bad sound quality on the battlefield
no lock on system
bad enemy ai
-(you can hide behind a rock and they seem to forget they even saw you)

----------------------------------------------

they really get the feel of iron man down in this game, probably better than any other superhero game, besides of course Spiderman 1-3 and Incredible Hulk Ulitmate Destruction. you can hover, fly, use turbo thrusters for high-speed flight. you have various long range attacks from small lazers to the uni-beam. to those of you who aren't familiar, its a huge beam that shoots from the circle on his chest, usually obliterating all in its path. you can also take great advantage of Iron Man's strength, ripping helicopters and tanks in half. you can also upgrade and customize all abilities.

the controls could've been a little more solid, but they're far beyond those of Superman the game, which is really the only base for comparison. there are very few games out there utilizing such an epic powerset. Marvel Ultimate Alliance(as amazing as it is) doesnt really count, its more of a dungeon crawler. a lock on system would've made combat a lot more headache-free. especially against the fighter jets.

in the end, its the only game that truly makes you feel like Iron Man. its honestly epic in every way, there were just a few bad design choices and a rushed release, which would explain the poor enviromental graphics(iron man himself looks good)

so any fan of Iron Man, or super heroes in general should try it. DEFFINITELY RENT before buying. just don't set your hopes too high.",3.0

"I grew up on the Super Nintendo, so I have a soft spot for the Donkey Kong Country trilogy. So I was excited to play this for both the Wii and 3DS.

Overall, the general spirit of the series is here. Donkey and Diddy are here along with some familiar supporting characters. Sadly, no Dixie. Kiddie Kong however is an acceptable omission, heh.

The game is pretty fun, especially hunting down all the secret rooms. But I have to admit I was disappointed in this game. As a veteran of the originals, this was hard to play. The controls were not as tight and smooth as I was accustomed to in previous games, the characters weren't as interesting, and the level design was significantly better in the originals.

If you've never played the original DKC trilogy, however, I could probably recommend this game as you would be more likely to enjoy it. Without the perfect controls and great atmosphere, story, and environments of the originals to compare to, this could be a fun and enjoyable game. But for me, it was frustrating. I'm a pretty experienced gamer, but often found the simplest jumps very frustrating to make, leading to many lost lives and level do-overs. And the game is not very forgiving to mistakes. A little bit more forgiving than the Wii version (easy mode was added here), but still very difficult at times. I enjoy intelligently difficult games, but this one is difficult in a more frustrating way (controls). The original DKC games were very difficult as well in parts, especially as you get towards the end of the game, but it was a fun difficult, where when you messed up you would think ""Ah man, I screwed up."" In this game though, the difficulty is more due to terrible controls and poor responsiveness.

The 3D effect is more extreme on this game, by far, than any other 3DS game I've tried. Since the 3DS has an adjustable 3D function to adjust this, that's not a problem, but it's something to be aware of. I love the heavy 3D personally, but sometimes when the slider is at max 3D, it can be a little straining, so I can see certain people not liking that.

My bottom line on this, is if you have a Wii U, skip this and get DKC Tropical Freeze, which is significantly more fun. Otherwise, this can be a good game for most, especially if you've never played the original trilogy. With how good Tropical Freeze is though, I fully expect future DKC games to continue with a high level of quality.",3.0

"This game is very linear, and has far too many cut scenes. In many areas you can't go back even a few feet to look around. Early in the game control is lost with no warning for either a cut scene or chase scene. I prefer to play my games, not watch them play themselves.",3.0
"Prototype is definitely one of those games where you aren't sure if it's a masterpiece or a complete waste of time... As I played through this game, I almost felt as if I was doing a chore by finishing the story. I honestly felt that just exploring the city and mutilating its civilians was a bit more fun than staying in tune with what was being said throughout the whole story line.

Don't get me wrong though, I did enjoy this game and the potential it had. I bought Prototype 2 after I completed the first, and without a doubt, the sequel is better in this case.

As for the small technical side of all of this, I found that the graphics and frame rate were quite alright. The textures loaded up pretty quick and the gameplay was smooth. I just wish they would have done more with the actual story and gameplay so I don't feel as though this game should be completely looked over.

In any case, Prototype is definitely a great time-waster and does give you hours of fun (if you're playing the way you want to). I do recommend checking this game out for yourself, too. You never know, what I think is mediocre, you might think is a blast.",3.0
"I love playing James Bond Everything or Nothing game and I love 3rd person shooter games and I was excited about getting this one. I was a little dissapointed in the game. The graphics are very bad and are grainy. You do not create your own Bond like it says you can, you just change between around 6 outfits from the original Bond movies. Multiplayer is also kind of bad on this game because it is so bland and unoriginal unlike other James Bond games. One last bad thing about this game is that the levels are not very challenging. Even on the hardest level the game is as easy as OPERATIVE on the other Bond games. But the good things about this game is that it is in 3rd person shooter, has the real voice of Sean Connery, and it keeps to the story pretty good. Even after all those things I could never sell this game because it is still a very fun game. But, the most stupid thing is that after your enemys die they just disapear! I thought this game was going to be better than everything or nothing but it is extremely worse.",3.0

This depends on how big of a gamer you are.  This is more for fighting games vs others (or so my son told me).  I guess this remote is more of a choice preference.  It feels like a sturdy remote.

"halo wars is a RTS halo style....yes there will be no run and gun here folks!...BUT i think the only thing that really keeps me playing is only the fact that it has halo units...if your a hardcore  RTS fan  but don't care about halo all that much..than maybe you should overlook this one!!

  thats not to say this game is not good, because it is a good game but that fact that you can only build bases in specific  spots really SUCKS! but the worst of it is the fact that if you play as UNSC you can only have a max of 40 units (tanks count as 3 and some others count as 2!) and the same goes for the covenant but they get 10 extra because their troops are a bit weaker...

  but all in all the game i gave a 3 star.... just because of the unit size and troops limit

But because I'm not a GTA fan and I know people would say to me You don't like grand theft auto, then I would say to them yes, I don't.

"This game has everything you would ever want in a sandbox-type game.  A greatly detailed and gigantic map, plenty of great cars, and a pretty easy to use interface.

I'll admit up front, I never had played a GTA game before this one, and for good reason, I wasn't allowed to.  But, alas, I am 19 years old and I wanted to see what all the fuss is about...

GTA IV is full of slobbery-good graphics, humorous, if not embarrassing moments and more cop killing than your average inner-city gang.

The story mode is deep and gives off a movie-like feel.  You get to know the characters and their personalities and along with this you form friendships.

I cannot really go to much further than to say that it was a well built game that will provide a lot of entertainment, but for me, it just gets old quick.  There is only a certain amount of time I can kill cops over and over and over again (see the online FREE MODE) and there is only a certain amount of time I can try to get in the pants of my virtual girlfriend (see STORY mode).

To me, the game got old and just didn't feel that fun.  If you have never played a GTA IV game, I'd say rent this game first, then buy it if you absolutely can't get enough, other than that, for the veterans of the GTA Franchise, this will be exactly what you want.",3.0

"Bought this game day 1 since the 3DS hardly had that many games, kind of disappointed by this game with lack of replay content.  Sure you can try to beat your own high score and such but after awhile you realize this ""game"" should of been included with the next Resident Evil game that comes out for the 3ds later on.  This game is pretty much a ""beat your own high scores and brag to your friends about it"" type of game.

Don't buy this game unless it's 10-15 bucks, seriously.",3.0
"First of all the running game is pretty fun, and the passing game is pretty well done now.  Even the AI seems better and you get what you deserve vs the CPU.  BUT this 'Infinity' physics/ tackling engine is an absolute horror show. If you see 10 tackles in a game that actually looks realistic you'll be lucky. And I won't even count guys flopping to the ground like rag dolls after a play is over or arms being bent in impossible ways.

Bottom line is the tackling physics and animations in this game are embarrassingly bad and stuff you'd never see on Sunday's in the NFL.  It's like grenades are going off around the ball carrier and guys just go flying all over the place on impact.  Or the RB and defender hit head on and they both go down like they've hit a brick wall or been shot in the back. Hardly any momentum of the RB is taken into account.  It's painfully unrealistic looking and it ruined the game for me.  It's inexcusable for such a key component such as TACKLING in a football game to be this much of a disaster and look like a joke.  EA... just go get the Euphoria physics/tackling engine that Backbreaker uses already and stop the madness.  For a football game... bad tackling means a bad game. NFL 2K5 has better tackling STILL which is mind boggling really!  Stop wasting time on Kinect controls and the social network BS and work on improving the actual game engine!  Such baby steps each year is pathetic man.
How can you have tackling this bad in Madden after all these years of development?  Tiburon is in over it's head is the answer.",3.0
"I don't get it, I really don't get it at all why there are 20 reviews here saying this game is 4 to 5 stars. Reviews everywhere saying it's the best racing game they have ever played!? Is it the only one you ever played? Quite frankly I found this game to rather boring and repetitive with not much involved in a limited options of driving around and crashing into things. Sure, I may not be a red neck, heck, I am not even American, but I do enjoy Demo Derby games, Monster Truck games and racing games in general. This one here however, it's far from the best racing game out there, and far from the best the PS2 has to offer.

You goal is to move up in the ranks of the Demolition Derby world, you start at 100, and need to make it to #1. You start off at your house where you can save or swap vehicles, then you can drive or skip to a junkyard to buy new cars, eventually unlock a spray shop to paint your car or buy upgrades, which are almost pointless, and then you can sometimes do a drag race, but for the most part you are drag racing to the event, and then competing in either a circuit race, a figure 8 race, which is a normal race but you have a high chance of smashing into another car on the jumps, then there is a race where a certain amount of cars go one way, and a certain go the other way, then there is some normal races with jumps, a few checkpoint sort of races, and a few more, but for the most part, every race feels the same with a different background image really.

If you love Demo Derby racing, and can't get enough of it, then you may want to spend hours on end doing these things over and over and over again, but for me, that is pretty damn boring, especially in the atmosphere this game provides. Even when using cheats to unlock more money and turbos, I still couldn't get into this game. I don't think this game competes with ""Destruction Derby Arenas"", which is not so much based on a real demo derby event, but it's still more fun, and I still say the best game out there where you can destroy your opponents in cars is ""Sideswiped"", surprisingly  on the Nintendo DS.

The graphics are nice, they show off the full potential of the PS2 graphics, both nice in car detail, roads and backgrounds. The controls are ok, and the music is, well, if you're like me and like Rob Zombie, then a few songs are great, but if you hate punk music or those annoying alternative artists who try to mimic The Sex Pistols voices, then BLURGHH.

It's the reply value that bothers me. I was bored within an hour of playing this. Being the only one here on Amazon not to give this game 4 or 5 stars, you may think i'm just being a troll or something, but seriously, read into who actually loves the game and who is just saying, ""My kids love this"", which translates into ""I didn't buy them a game they hated""... sure, I don't HATE this game, but I don't love it either, and I don't think I can be bothered playing it anymore when everything just feels like your going around in circles, competing in the same event a million times with tracks that are either circuits or circuits with hills, there is just not excitement or adrenalin rush to be found. Quite frankly, I found Hot Wheels to be a much more enjoyable game.",3.0
"First off folks, don't let the whole ""wired"" deal turn you off from this controller. 10m of wiring is plenty to string over the coffee table and to the sofa on the other side. The controller itself has a great deal of silicon parts like the joysticks and the handles for comfort and grip. The buttons are all the same as you would find them on a PS3 controller. The configuration however is more like the XBOX controller. Normally during our parties, we always have a XBOX head who finds the microsoft controllers more comforting. More power to him, since this Power A controller is perfect for that.

Now this particular controller comes with the Metal of Honor badges and the overall design of the controller which I love. I also like the options of turning on the lights.

Now what I don't like is the fact that we could not get the fan to work ONCE. We tried the red light, blue light and on several different ports. No dice. Not sure what the problem is. Maybe we have to configure it in the controller settings, but if you're here for the CONTROLLER, get it.

"BUYER BEWARE! DO NOT give your hard earned $$ to MicroThieves.  I owned the Original Xbox and presently have the 360.  It is a very good system. But when I buy my next system, it will be a PS4.

You do get 1 free game a month via a download. But then they rape you on the cost of the DLC.  Most times I can get a new copy cheaper at Amazon.com., with the DLC included.  The same goes for their monthly ""50% & 75%"" off sales for select games. Again, you can buy a hard copy, with the DLC, almost anywhere else for LESS $$!  The pricing for older and old games is outrageous!  EXAMPLE: Prey- MicroThieves download: $25.  Amazon.com new: $16.  Game Stop used with scratch protection: $3.  REALLY?  The game is 8 years old. EXAMPLE 2- SKYRIM  DOWNLOAD: $30 for the game and another $45 for fhe DLC. AMAZON.COM new with the same DLC: $30. I could give many more examples, but you get the point.

"...I bought this game today 21 July 2010. The main selling point was that you can create your own racing tracks and customize your racers and vehicles. The first thing i notice is that the load times are very long. Second, for a game that has so many options to customize its content why doesnt it offer you the choice to change around your controller options?! They put the gas pedal on the R2 button, big mistake!. because of the design of the R2 button its hard to keep your finger pressing down without applying ALOT of pressure cuz your finger slowly slides off the button which makes your hand ache after a few minutes. so that alone makes this game unplayable in my eyes. Third, its hard to tell what powerups you pick up from the track. They use very creative symbols for the powerups but that also makes it very hard to figure out what it is especially when your zoooming around a racetrack! Just keep the symbols simple! Because of these 3 reason i didn't even bother to check out the rest of the game! Ill just go back to playing Mario Kart Wii....

Second was the over all controls , you need to be a circus juggler to jump from button when the action gets fast.

"There should be a law, and I volunteer to organize a protest to get things rolling.  Did no one involved with the movie Minority Report pay attention to Activision's most recent games?  Such as Spiderman: The Movie?  Now don't get me wrong....I gave Spiderman 5 stars, but Minority Report is NOT Spiderman.
Minority Report, the movie, is a stunningly beautiful, story-driven mix of action, drama, and suspense created through ethical dilemmas.  Minority Report, the game, is a fun, combat-driven game with incredible rag-doll-enemy effects, cool futuristic weapons, and a fair dose of jet-pack insanity.
""What's your problem?"" you're saying.  ""It sounds to me like you liked both the movie AND the game.  So quit your whining, you pathetic, left-over carnival prize, before I...""
Now wait a second....I didn't say I liked the game.  It's fun, but I don't like it.  The combat is great, but I found myself just playing the same level over and over, trying out different moves, instead of going through the other 40-or-so equally repetitive levels.  And I kept being dissapointed with the lame, badly-animated cutscenes.  (An even greater loss than Tom Cruise as John Anderton, is the loss of Colin Farrel as Danny Witwer.  The voice talent that replaced him put me in physical pain.  No, really.  Miss Cleo could have delivered a more convincing performance as the cocky CIA agent.)  And the story isn't even the same!  Not even close!!!  It's as though the folks at Activision had a meeting and carefully decided to screw up what could have been one of the greatest epic action/adventure games ever.

"Any time I can play through an entire game without dying on Normal difficulty, I think something's up.  This game is EASY!  I finally died on very hard, but only twice before beating the game, playing as an Alchemist (this games version of a wizard).

By no means am I an expert at gaming, though I am an avid Diablo and Fate fan.  I figured that this game, developed by people who worked on both projects would have a lot in common with them...what I didn't realize is what an exact clone of the Diablo playing style with the graphics of a game like Fate this game would be.  Skill trees look the same, skills are basically the same, although more limited in Torchlight, including only a bare minimum of spells.  This is another big disappointment for me - there is NOTHING new or original about this game, not even the music.  You get all the basics of Diablo - set items, uniques, rares, scrolls to identify, transport back to town, NPCs in town who are very generic, and you have to use the transmuter in much the same way you used the Horadric cube in Diablo 2.  In fact, the only difference I noted was that it only takes 2 of each gem to upgrade, as opposed to three from Diablo.

With all this said about the game, I did play the whole thing through twice.  It's fun, but I think it's just way too generic and way too easy for me to recommend it too highly.",3.0

"This has all been done before. Whatever inspiration The Godfather movie may have provided mobster-game designers over the past decades, the boat for this genre sailed long ago, and The Godfather game seems like a desperate attempt to catch up. It plays like the counterparts it may have inspired, namely the GTA series and Mafia. The slight differences in game play are negligible for the most part, so the only thing the game has going for it is that it is the genuine article. In other words, the main reason to buy this game is if you are really into The Godfather movies; it offers nothing substantially different than any other game in the genre.

There is, however, one innovation that turns out to be a colossal failing of the interface, and that should NEVER be used again - AUTO-TARGETING. Let me explain how this ""works"":

In most shooter games, the player moves the cursor toward the target, then the cursor changes into a crosshairs or lights up etc. to indicate a good shot. If you want to lock onto a target, you may press a button or click a mouse key, but the player controls the aim. In The Godfather game, the interface SELECTS A TARGET FOR YOU when you click the mouse button. Try to imagine the horror of this. The computer inevitably picks the wrong target (civilians, dead bodies, non-hostile NPCs, concealed targets when wide open targets are available). CYCLING between targets simply DOES NOT WORK. You are more likely to reselect the same target you just dropped than another target you want. This leaves you in the awkward position of firing repeatedly at a non-target far away while being shot at close distance by the guy in front of you. Yes, you are given the ability to manually aim, but this doesn't work either. Your manual aim is done from (literally) the hip. This makes using cover pointless if you want to aim for yourself because although you point the cursor at the head of your enemy, you are unable to shoot over the box you are behind because it is at waist height! The use of cover and shooting around walls is very important because you have no body armor in the game, but the flakiness of the autotarget feature and the limitations of manual aiming makes this part of play very frustrating.

The developers totally wasted the Mature rating their game garnered. Yes there is ""intense violence"", but not gore: no amputations, decapitations, exploding or burned bodies, splatter, and barely any blood spray. In this regard, GTA has it beat. There is also no sex or drugs, just a few f-bombs here and there.

And for God's sake will someone please turn that Godfather music off? Nope - can't be done. No skipping through most cut-scenes either so you may want to have something else ready to do while you sit through them.

The game is fun, but so is GTA. There is nothing particularly fresh here. The mobster genre is just exhausted, and introducing an old-classic doesn't revive it. Note that gameplay is beautifully stable and glitch free, kudos on that.",3.0

"STORY-

The Raposa, a bunch of fuzzy storybook creatures, are having their world destroyed before their very eyes. A Raposa turned evil named Wilfre is out to turn everything to shadow and take over. Mari, a young girl, begs for help from the Creator, the person who designed everything in their world. The Creator was said to have abandoned the Raposa long ago, but he finally responds to Mari's desperate plea and agrees to design a hero made from a mannequin to save the storybook. It is explained that you must collect pages from the Book of Life to restore the world to its former beauty. Henceforth, you control the hero who must rescue the Raposa from evil.

BATTLE SYSTEM-

This game is a typical sidescroller, and you have only a few simple attacks to get through these levels. Jumping will be your most effective tool throughout the game, and although you get customizable weapons which shoot objects, you will resort to bashing enemies on the head most of the time. There are several bosses scattered throughout the realms that you must defeat to progress. While these fights are varied enough, the normal enemies you will encounter are less than endearing. It can seem almost too easy to kill yourself at first, either by running out of ammo in a tight spot or by getting eaten alive by shadowy bats and fish. Despite the hardships new players may encounter, this game soon turns into a standard action adventure that won't challenge the mind or the fingers.

GAMEPLAY-

Drawn to Life, as the name implies, centers around the `drawing' aspect of the game. There are several times throughout each level where you will have to use your painting skills to get through. In fact, the game basically kicks off by having you design your very own hero to save the world. This may sound appealing at first, but the drawing system is more like MS Paint than Photoshop. You can choose from premade creations, but stubborn artists (like me) may attempt to make their own. This will usually result in an odd-looking thing which doesn't come close to what you had in mind originally. Players hoping to have a fantastic hero like the one on the cover of the box may be sorely disappointed (there are, as a matter of fact, people who design amazingly detailed Samus or Mega Man sprites, but anything that takes for than ten minutes to design is out of the question for me). You can edit your character at any time by tapping on Creation Hall, but any improvements made will most likely be minimal. Your character isn't on the same level as the Raposa sprites running around, making you feel as though you're a kindergartner on finger painting day. The designers seemed to have recognized this, since most of the things you will end up `drawing' throughout the levels are premade templates that can be filled in with the paint bucket tool. Don't get me wrong; if I had drawn a whale it would have been hideous...but it would have been my whale. The Raposa village aside, the levels are fairly generic platforming territory. There's not much to be said here that hasn't been said before. You can use various customizable tools to work your way through the levels, such as wings, a diving suit and the different modifications of your original gun. The customization of these items make the game fun and good for a laugh or two when observing your crudely drawn clouds, gusts of wind or flowers. The object of the game is to collect all the pages of the Book of Life and to bring back the Raposa village. In each level there are four fragments of a page that must be collected to advance. Other things to `collect' include lost Raposa, secrets (which give you new patterns, sounds or abilities) and shadow percentage, which shows how much darkness you've removed from a level. Unfortunately, this game becomes repetitive after a few levels, and a pattern can begin to be seen. Enter a level, collect templates, exit level, fix something and then continue doing this till the end of Drawn to Life. At its heart, Drawn to Life is an average platformer with a few extra tidbits thrown in there to make it enjoyable. I must admit, it's gratifying to see my own hero (dubbed `Mac') jumping, swimming and snowboarding his way through the varied worlds.

VISUALS, CHARACTERS, and CHARM-

The graphics in this game don't exactly fail to impress, but they don't boggle the mind, either. All things considered, Drawn to Life feels like a game that could have been produced on the GBA were it not for the 'drawing' aspect of the game. It's entirely possible that this game was simply an excuse to show off the touch screen's capabilities. The colors are often bright and vivid, and the Raposa are adorable little furry creatures. The style of this game seems to appeal more to smaller children who adore cute things. As mentioned before, the character YOU design will most likely not be 'cute' by anyone's standard but your own. Most heroes that are drawn from scratch tend to have some messy edges, sloppy coloring and indistinguishable features. Although you only start out with Mari, Jowee and the mayor in your town, you will gain more and more as you advance through the levels. It's fun to see the different Raposa you've picked up throughout the worlds, since each one has their own unique personality. Despite this, the characters are fairly 2-D in more than one way. Most of them are static characters with flat (if not vaguely amusing) personalities, and some you will rarely talk to at all. To be fair, you probably *will* grow to love the weird little furballs throughout the course of the story, and although the plot is clichd, it is also strangely endearing.

OVERALL-

Drawn to Life is a generally average game with shiny packaging and emphasis on 'drawing'. If you were expecting to whip up fantastic creations at a whim, you'll be disappointed with the lopsided creatures you design yourself. A tired, overused story and fairly unoriginal characters don't help this game's plight. All in all, you've got yourself a decent platformer-sidescroller with some creativity and customization thrown into the mix. It's enjoyable, but brings little to the table that hasn't been seen before. Try borrowing from a friend before purchasing.",3.0

"I have this game and bought it at Gamestop, but I played this game for 2 hours now and seems like a really fun game so far. But all I have to tell you is that Natsume made a big mistake of the concept of using the stylus for the entire game which makes the controls really annoying.

Graphics
Typical Harvest moon graphics, you pretty much the same as the other Harvest Moon for DS

Sounds
I love the music in the Spring time pretty good and upbeating. I pretty much like all the Harvest moon music.

Gameplay
Great concepts, you have to get money to buy a new bridge and get more people on the island. The more you plant and gain more money and get more shippments, the more people will come.

Controls
By far the worst part, but yet the most important part. I know I complained about the stylus, but you use it for your tools, moving around shipping and pretty much everything. The Control pad and Buttons are only good to select crops or your weapons, but it is easy at this point to use the stylus.  L and R buttons are pointless, it makes your character run, but you have your stylus do it for your automatically.

Maybe I have not got use to the stylus or controls part, but I like using the D-pad to move and the buttons to farm.  It is sort of annoying because you farm much slower.  Meaning you have to go to the square and tap the stylus and then move again and do it again.  Now it was easy just using the D-pad, but it is a pain with the style because the character does not move where you tell him/her to do.

Also, you can not use the cheating method of getting something out of your rugsack easily you have to go tap the menu and then put it in your read box and then ship it. Then it asks you the question do you really want to ship it.  I am not so sure if you loose friendship points if you litter or not.

Overall:

Natsume would have hit the mark if they implemented the controls like the other Harvest Moon games.  If I known the controls were bad, I would have not bought the game nor the game guide because I loved every Harvest moon game I bought from them for the DS and gameboy, N64, Gamecube and etc..",3.0
"The sheer, overwhelming popularity of ""Assassin's Creed II"" is what finally compelled me to buy it. Coming into it, having seen gameplay clips and much praise about ""how much better than ACI it [was]"", I expected something at least average. Unfortunately, I have been spoiled by the ease-of-use offered by the control schemes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infamous/dp/B000ZK7ZOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infamous</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratchet-Clank-Future-A-Crack-in-Time/dp/B00275A7LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prototype/dp/B000WQWPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prototype</a>. Honestly, the controls are a mess, but the experience is well-done.

1. SOUND. Undoubtedly one of the most immersive and atmospheric games on the market. The background voices of the crowds, the shopkeepers calling out their wares, the heralds, the doctors, people commenting on your climbing abilities... It all adds up to make for a realistic experience, smoothed out by a breathtaking, Hollywood-quality musical score. Standout tracks include ""Ezio's Family"", ""Earth"", and ""Venice Rooftops"", all of which lovingly combine modern-sounding synthetic rhythms with ageless symphonic, both ethereal and beautiful. (5/5)

2. GRAPHICS. The textures on characters are nearly flawless, the amount of detail in the world around the player is amazing, and the contrast of light and shadow is nicely done. The day-to-night and vice versa transitions are also wonderfully done. The performance capture on the characters is fantastic, and the facial animations rarely venture into the ""uncanny valley"". Still, it's very obvious that the game uses ""ragdoll"" physics rather than some of the higher-end and more realistic physics engines. I still have trouble believing that the game uses the Havok engine. (3/5)

3. LENGTH AND SIZE. With Venice being the largest of them all, the different locations are immersive, wonderfully rendered, highly realistic, and a lot of fun to play around in. Though the game itself is somewhat short, with Sequences 12 and 13 only being available as downloadable content (there are no Trophies for these, so it's still possible to get every trophy without downloading them), and the framing story being a bit uninteresting, the amount of side-missions and treasure-hunting to do around in each of the worlds is enough to keep oneself busy for days or weeks at a time. From the marshes to the mountains to the cathedral in Rome, the sheer size and historical value of the game is sure to entertain and amaze. (3/5)

4. NARRATIVE. Personally, I didn't enjoy the framing narrative of the Pieces of Eden (as I feel the 2012 conspiracy has been much overdone), but the narrative within Ezio's story itself is intriguing. From Leonardo da Vinci to Machiavelli himself, there are so many characters - both real and original - to flesh out the game and make it feel like it really took place. Overall, the internal story is very well-done and engaging, and despite the framing narrative, the ending sequence was quite interesting - and a little bit creepy, not to mention that I found it vaguely offensive in spite of the disclaimer shown at the beginning of each gaming session. (4/5)

5. CONTROLS. The controls take some getting used to, and even after getting used to them, are still rather broken. The context commands are difficult, and the parkour movements are so clumsy it makes one want to crush the controller in sheer frustration. Hopping from point to point is a nightmare, as sometimes Ezio will plunge off a roof for no apparent reason. Climbing is at first a nightmare as well, as often Ezio tends to jump off entirely, sometimes to his death. Context commands outside of combat are okay, but in combat, the motion-captured movements are so clumsy and slow that it makes you glad the enemies are incapable of moving any faster than you. The lack of Sixaxis support for Leonardo's flying machine is blatantly obvious and would have likely made the sequence (sequences, if you download Sequence 12) easier for the PS3 version. The camera is also rather awful, and all these combine to make for a somewhat nauseating experience. (1/5)

6. CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE. Being interrupted, at least early in the game, every two to three minutes by a cutscene that cannot be skipped just serves to make the game less enjoyable. There's no doubt that the motion capture done on the characters is very well done, but instead of integrating the story into the game, the game is integrated into the story. In other words, this plays like a very well-done but rather clumsy big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. At times, it feels as though it would have been better off as a film. (2/5)

OVERALL: the controls are broken regardless of one's skill with them. However, the rest of the game is well done and, for the most part, nicely enjoyable. Total Score: (18/30)",3.0
"I'm not going to insult this game, because it's not TERRIBLE. However, it's not the kind of game that you get addicted to-it's a pretty basic racing game. I wouldn't suggest buying it until you try it out first, to see if it's the kind of thing you would like.",3.0
yeah it sucks for the tekken guys in this game. I played it once and just put the controller down because it's soo much to learn on the street fighter side. after practicing I got the hang of it.....then went over to the tekken side of the game and boi they like don't have any cool moves to show off it freaking sucks playing with them. This game looks good but if you're not one of those guys that stay up till 3am playing with the same guy over and over trying to master every move than this game will get old quick. Not as good as Ultimate Marvel VS capcom if you ask me but its close. rent if you a fan of coolness because you have to be a ultimate trained master to enjoy all the cool moves and kick some as.,3.0
"Gabe and Tycho said it best.  It sucks that you have to play hundreds of hours to make computer Tiger Woods like Tiger Woods.  You have to unlock everything before the game becomes any fun at all.

When I buy a golf video game I shouldnt have to work harder than I do in real life at golf.

In real life I can hit 300yd drives.  In Tiger Woods Golf how many hours and wins do I have to stack up before a driver will pass 275yds????  I can hit that with my 3WOOD!

"I didn't read up on any of the reviews for the Wii U before buying, but my classic Wii had broken and needed replacing so I went out and bought the pack with Zelda.

I look on the box and see it is a Zelda Download code, so great, have to download the game, but that shouldn't take too long.

I get the Wii U out and after getting it installed into my home system, I start the Wii up.  Find I have to setup the network, then setup a user account, check to see if any of my old user account information could transfer over, etc.  An hour later I had my Wii started.  My 8 year old son was very impatient to play Zelda by this point, but I told him I had to download it first.

I finally try to go to the store, have to wait for a system update, another 20 minutes or something, finally get into the store and have to download Zelda and the E-Book included.  I download both, it starts with the 270 MB or so E-Book and takes forever to download it, and find that Zelda is 1.7 GB.  We decide to start reading the E-Book and let Zelda download in the background.  An hour later we check on Zelda and it hadn't done anything and had an error and quit.  It resumed after we checked on it.

Long story shorter, 4 hours later we were able to get into Zelda and play, because Nintendo must have the slowest download servers on the planet.  Why can't they put the 50 cent disc in the box?

That aside, the neutral rating on the Wii U is because it is the slowest console I have ever used, switching between screens is on the order of 10 seconds, where it was very quick on the original Wii.  Amazon and Netflix constantly lock up and crash the Wii U necessitating a trip up to the console to hold the power button for 4 seconds.

The Wii U controller display is always on, even when streaming video to the TV, draining the batteries so your game pad is always discharged when you need it, or permanently stuck on the charger.  Battery life of the game pad is only okay, a couple hours maybe, which really isn't enough for an afternoon of game play.

Why don't I give it 1 star?  It is still fun to play if you can put up with all the issues.  The included Zelda game is fun, not one I had played before, and looks good on my high def TV, but clearly not up to the standards of other game systems.

The worst part is I tried to set up an account for my son and Nintendo requires you verify this with a credit card and they even have the gal to charge for this.

Verdict: C, Nintendo really messed this one up",3.0

"SEGA Superstars Tennis is bright graphically, somewhat dull in most other respects. Had it been designed for the 360/PS3 exclusively the graphics would probably have a lot more detail than they already do; it feels like it has a case of Xbox1/Wii-itis. It's good fan service but as a game seems more like a $39.99 title. ""Travellers Tales"" style production values mixed with Virtua Tennis 3 controls; which isn't a bad thing just a bit generic. Certain courses seem to have either slowdown or a slower framerate, not sure which but it's a bit annoying. Overall the game is fun but a bit shallow, it's basically what I expected but had hoped for a lot more I guess.

7/10 so far, better than the past couple of Sonic Team games at least.",3.0

"Finally, after SIX FRIGGIN YEARS, we finally get to play as the big guy himself from the Matrix trilogy!  That's right, put your hands together, because you play as...Mouse!

Just kidding!  Unlike the last matrix game, this time you finally get to play as the savior of mankind, Neo.  Was it worth the wait?  From my point of view, yes.

Before we go any further, I'd like to give everyone a warning about the game.  WHEN YOU SEE A WHITE SCREEN AND TWO CHAIRS COMING TOWARDS YOU, SKIP THIS CUTSCENE!  IF YOU DON'T, THE GAME WILL RUIN THE ENDING FOR YOU!

There we go.  I apologize if I gave you the impression that I was shouting, but I wish that someone had told me this before I played the game.  More on this later.

At first glance, Path of Neo simply seems to be a reworked Enter the Matrix, except that you play as Neo, and with better graphics.  In a way that's true, because Path of Neo (PON) is a third person game where you run around shooting lots of guns, getting into lots of hand to hand combat, and doing cool matrix moves.

What all is different here from Enter the Matrix?  Better graphics for one.  While lots of people don't seem to think the graphics are bad, they really aren't.  They are better then Enter the Matrix and have a higher level of quality.  There are lots of moments where I went ""Wow"" when seeing some spectacular scenery.  But, as many have pointed out, when you get up close and personal, the graphics can get pretty blocky and unimpressive.  Overall, I'd say the graphics are pretty good, but not earth-shattering.

But gameplay always takes superiority over graphics.  And while it stumbles along the way, PON for the most part succeds.  If you haven't guessed already from the title, you play PON from Neo's point of view.  You start out as wimpy Mr. Anderson, running from cops and armed only with a push move.  As the game moves on, you slowly begin to unlock powerful moves one by one, further transforming yourself from a wimply desk worker to an ass-kicking trenchcoat fighter (who knows kung-fu!).

The meat and potatoes of PON is it's fighting engine.  While the last game was a half and half mix between firing weapons and doing button mashing, PON places a bigger emphasis on hand to hand combat.  While you can get into big gunfights if you want to, more often then not you'll be getting up close and personal with your feet and with your fists.  Herin lies PON's greatest strength.  The hand to hand combat system is a lot better and a lot more satisfying then Enter the Matrix was.  While you could breeze through the last game simply by mashing buttons, you have to actually work and memorize combos to get through PON.

But you don't have to worry about seeing the combination for a move only once, then try to memorize it.  PON has a nifty feature to help you out.  When you get into hand to hand combat with an enemy, the game oftentimes suggests what buttons to press by showing the button in the left corner of the screen.  For example, start punching an enemy with the triangle button, and the game will show the square button, suggesting that you should press that button to disarm the enemy.  This feature is extremly useful, and helps you learn the various moves quickly.

And oh boy...you get some incredibly powerful moves througout the game.  By the end of your journey as Neo, you'll be smashing jaws, punching people twenty times in five seconds, and smashing your foe's skulls into the ground while you stand on them.  Shiny has put virtually all of Neo's moves from the movies into the game, and it's great fun to do them yourself, including his ""run up guy's chest and kick him in head"" move to ""Slam both fists into an enemy, sending them flying across the room"".  Pulling off these moves eventually becomes a breeze, and when you get really good at it, you will really feel like you are Neo, because you can take down any foe you come across.  Late in the game, agents won't be able to get even close to you without flying across the room from a well placed kick.

If you don't feel like doing hand to hand combat, you can take up gunfighting.  Neo will come across a large array of weapons during his path as the One (though the variety of weapons is nowhere near as big as the last game).  You get pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, bombs, even grenade launchers (very useful against helicopters).  All of these weapons get the job done, but trust me, you'll have much more fun punching your foes!  Though I have to admit, flying through the air in slow motion while firing in every possible direction is quite cool!

Because you are the one, and because you are aware that the matrix is an illusion, you have the abillity to focus yourself and use the illusion to your advantage.  Focus returns from the last game, but it's slightly tweeked.  Focus is essentially the ability to move faster, punch harder (much harder) and use exclusive moves that are physically impossible to pull off.  With the touch of a button, you can stop bullets, dodge bullets, leap high into the air, take out up to four foes at once, and so much more.  You'll even be able to activate code vision, which allows you to see those famous green lines that make up the matrix.

While the game does contain virtually every action sequence from all three movies (sorry guys, you can't have sex with trinity in Zion), it expands many of these scenes.  For example, at the end of the first movie, Neo stopped bullets, destroyed Smith, and glared at the other agents.  In the game, you stop the bullets, but then run through the rooms in the hallway, laying the smackdown on the agents.  Likewise, after Neo beats up the Merovingians thugs (Sadly, you can't kill that french a**hole.  Why?!), he has to journey through the guy's dungeons to reach Morpheus and Trnity.  It's a blast to fight Smith, participate in the Burly brawl, and take to the skies in the explosive final battle from Revolutions.

There are several scenes put in exclusivly for the game that are not in the movie.  Most of these scenes take place in the timeframe between movies 1 and 2, telling you some of the things that Neo did between the movies.  In one truly brilliant level that should have been in the second movie, you run around T.V. filled hallways while Agent Smith ominously taunts you from the screens.

Sound and audio work well too.  Laurence Fishburn (Morpheus) returns to do new audio for his charachter and does a great Job.  For everyone else we have imitators who do a really good job (but Agent Smith sounds nothing like he was in the movie).  The music is...well, music.  Almost nothing from the movie's soundtrack made it in, but the new stuff is simply average.

There are also a good amount of jokes in the game, poking fun at movie critics (""Oh I get it, the black suited guy is the savior of humanity!""), video game critics (""Video games are teaching our children violence!""), and video games themselves (""I got the high score on Time Crisis"").  My favorite joke comes from Agent Smith.  When you get cut off from him, he keeps talking to you ""I know you're in there Mr. Anderson!  I can...smell you!""

But alas, PON does make a few foulups along the way, mostly with control, repetitivness, and the final battle.

The control is probably the biggest problem that you'll face in PON.  It's a very strange setup which takes the better part of an hour or two to get the hang of.  Gunplay in paticular is terrible.  You press R2 to pull out your gun (which is selcted with the left and right buttons), use the right analog stick to select your target, then press square to fire.  During all of your gun battles, you'll also be moving with the left analog stick, jumping through the air and using focus as well, meaning that you'll be pressing more buttons as well.  So you'll be running around, focusing, jumping, targeting, and shooting all at the same time.  It's frustrating to get the hang of, but thankfully, it eventually becomes second nature.

The repetivitvness is another problem.  All but two of the game's missions eventually boil down to ""Run around and beat everyone up"".  This is fun, but the game suffers from a lack of variety in the missions.  The only exceptions are the opening stealth level and a turret shooting level.

The storytelling in the game is a joke.  The game does feature clips and scenes from all the matrix movies (and the animatrix as well), but the editing is in a fast cut/music video style, which just doesn't work.  I was able to figure out what was going on, but the storytelling in the game is very sloppy and doesn't work.  Seeing all the movies is necessary before you play the game.

Some sections of the game are also quite short.  The burly brawl sequence lasts less then five minutes, not even enough time to beat up the Smith's you want to.

The biggest issue I have with the game is with the final battle, and the ending.  Before you worry, i'm not going to reveal what they are.

The final battle from Revoltuions is the game's final level, where you fight Smith on the street, in the air, in the building, and in the crater.  But after that battle is over, the game has you do one final fight that's not from the movie.  It starts out with a cutscene of the Wachowski brothers coming onscreen and explaining why they changed the ending of the game from the movie.  In the process, they tell you what the final battle is before you play it, giving away any suprise that you might have had.  This is an enormously stupid mistake that ruined the battle for me.  It's like the director of the sixth sense showing up on screen five minutes before the end of the movie and saying, ""Well, I had this in mind for the ending, but I decided to make it so that Bruce Willis was a ghost the entire time.  Enjoy the suprise ending!"".  I can't see how the wachowski brothers did this.  If you want the final confrentation to be a suprise, you don't give it away before people play it!

So when you see a white screen with two chairs coming towards you, skip the scene.  Trust me, you won't miss anything.  I wish someone had told me about this.

And the battle itself? Well...uhm...uh...it's really one of those things that you really hate, or that you find fairly amusing.  It feels like it could be in the movie, yet it wouldn't work.  In stort, I expected to find the battle in a superman comic book, rather then in a scene from the matrix saga.

The claim, ""An all new ending"" is a lie.  The ending is just two clips from the ending of revolutions put together, lasting about fourty seconds.  Then the credits play.  And the ending that is givin to you is enormously unsatisfying.  Here, I do need to give a small spoiler, so if you want to stay completely spoiler free for the ending, look away!  ******The game doesn't tell you, show you, or even hint at what happens to Neo after the game ends.  It should be no suprise that he surivives the final battle with Smith in the game, yet the game doesn't show you what happens to him.  It's INCREDIBLY dissapointing********

So in the end, your reward for all your hard work is a fizzled, half-baked ending that is a big letdown.

But I don't want to paint a poor picture of PON.  When it's fun, it's really fun.  It's heads and tails about Enter the Matrix, and is every matrix fan's dream come true.  If you want to play as Neo, and if you are a big fan of the movies like I am, then you'll have a lot of fun with this game.

I should also say that PON is one of those games that you should rent before you buy.  And even then, don't buy it for full price.  Wait until it sells for about twenty dollars, and you'll get a much better deal.

If you really like the matrix triogy, then you'll most likely like this game.",3.0
"The Controls
People love hating on the way this game controls, and that is a fair criticism. But you should cut it some slack for being a port from PC platform so the controls are not as polished as a game like Robinson. I also think that a lot of the hate comes from people who are using six axis instead of move controllers. If you have a PS VR and no move controllers that's on you Buddy! Spend the money and and get the full VR experience.

The problem with the controls is  you can really only look around in a 180 degree window, if you want to turn beyond that you have to point the move controller the direction you want to go and click the move button. Once you get used to it, it's not so bad. The infuriating part is that this is not the case for the entire game, there are lots of areas where you can freely turn your field of vision 360 degrees. They lose a star from me for not taking the time to update their port to give you the ability to look 360 degrees throughout the game. Other reviewers also take issue with the fact that you can't spin freely with the controller, instead, when you turn it pops your field of view around incrementally, that's really not a bad thing, If you've played Rigs and instantly gotten nauseous like I did you will totally understand why the Devs chose to do it that way. For some reason your arms feel too short, often times you can't reach an item, you reach for it and it highlights so you can still pick it up, but it really spoils the immersion.

The game

It's kind of Meh, not really inspired ""Go here, get this, do this with it"" There's a lot of dialogue, the graphics don't have the polish that Robinson does, The character models almost look last gen, but the environments look pretty good.

"This game is  a bit better than Mask of the Betrayer however it is still not finished. This game was rushed and is full of bugs the most annoying is the merchant system. You can not ship anything that is not ore, timber or skins if you do you get ore timber and skins in the warehouse or nothing at all and that is if you ship from highcliff. If you try to ship from some other town you get nothing. Worse still you can not put anything in the warehouse without shipping it.

The overhead map (world map) is very painful to navigate on since you need the skills of a druid, ranger and thief to gain any real use out of your party leader. which can make having a party of fighters or mages a real pain. I find it dumb that the overhead map (world map) is still fogged over even during day time night time i understand day time walking in a field  makes no sense. Yes light sources and dark vision help a small amount. I also find that having to search for objectives blindly is kind of foolish if the npc knows where the objective is maybe they should point to it on your map and when you are on the over head map you should be able to click it and walk to the objective with out having to search an area to stumble upon the objective. Mind you that is for some missions not all missions.

This game has a lot of patches in it's future. Well at least they fixed it so that you can not beat the game in under 3 hours like MOB. Thanks in part due to that this game is more a bunch of mini-quests than actual main story well that and you will spend a whole lot of your time fighting encounters than actually Adventuring into huge dungeons or any thing of the sort.

"I am a huge fan of football, and I love to play them as well. I always enjoy playing football games and being able to pull of spectacular runs and big plays. However, the football genre has been growing stale with EA owning the exclusive rights to create NFL games. It has really discouraged any competition from rising, but Backbreaker attempts to break this mold. It might not be as good or as polished as Madden, but it certainly brings new ideas and helps football video games feel fresh again.

Backbreaker features a game engine known as the Euphoria engine. This makes every play unique as no two tackles are ever the same. Animations are created on the spot as none of the animations are pre programmed. This creates some really strong hits and a great physics engine, but it also creates some goofy animations that just look laughable. It also has a camera angle (which cannot be changed) that is behind the shoulders. This gives much more weight to the hits and brings everything up close and personal, but it also obstructs your view on the field and what you can see.

For the 11 on 11 football, Backbreaker falls a bit short to it's competitors. The controls are much different, but intuitive at the same time. Running the ball feels authentic as you are able to juke, spin, hurdle, stiff arm, and (my favorite) truck your way to the end zone. All of this is done on precise timing, making you feel very in control when running with the ball. Passing has thankfully been patched up, allowing more accurate throws and better route running. The problem with passing, however, is the fact that the receivers will often drop passes. Even in open areas, they will drop the ball if they are even lightly tapped. Also, changing receivers is a pain since the camera is behind the shoulders, making it difficult for you to see the whole field.

The game features over 50 teams each with unique attributes and stats. The offline modes, however, are a mixed bag. There is a season mode which you can pick which teams and how many teams are in the league. You can scout and draft players, but that is really it as nobody retires, there's no free angency, and no contracts to deal with. There is also a Road to Backbreaker mode as you take a created team of low attributes in an 8 team league and take them to a 32 team league to win the championship. This mode has you earn points to buy better players in free agency, but it also doesn't offer much in replayability. The tackle alley mode is a blast to play as you battle through 100 waves trying to get into the endzone without getting tackled. This mode really shows the glory of the euphoria engine and it's physics. It is also two players competitive, which is allot of fun to play with a buddy.

Another great thing going for this game is the customization. Creating a team features it's own logo creator which is very advanced and limitless while also having a very in-depth uniform editor. It certainly takes a long time to make a team since there is allot you can customize. However, there is no create-a-player in here and all you can change on existing players on your created team is the skin tone and the jersey number. This really takes away from the immersion as everyone looks like a person from a tech demo.

Overall, this game has allot of thing going for it as well as some flaws which hold it back from it's true potential. Without any worthwhile mode, you might not play this game for a long time. The physics engine is amazing, but the 11 on 11 football has it's issues with passing the ball and some funny glitches that happen at random. If you're looking for an alternative from Madden, this is the game for you. For everyone else, I would tell you to give it a rental and see what you think about it.",3.0
"Pros:
+A Good Storyline
+Nice cast of characters
+Good soundtrack
+Fairly good voice acting
+Beautiful artwork
+Lots of customization thanks to the job system

Cons:
-Limitations of items adds more frustration than challenge
-In battle voices are annoying
-In battle graphics aren't great
-Sometimes sound effects are off and slight hitches in framerate
-There really isn't as much freedom as there appears to be; in many missions you must do it the way the game suggests or you'll end up having to restart the mission

The Hex Battle System of Wild Arms 4 and 5 was a sign that Wild Arms would be a good candidate for a tactical RPG.  So we get Wild Arms XF.  Unfortunately, the jump to Tactical RPG just isn't fantastic.  Especially because it has to follow such well done Tactical RPGs such as Jeanne D'Arc and Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness.  Wild Arms has some things going for it, but it suffers heavily in the gameplay department.

Wild Arms XF begins in the middle of the action.  You're introduced to Clarissa and her brother Felius. They're both confronting a man named Rupert, who has stolen their mother's sword and plans to use it for some evil doings.  Rupert gets away and so Clarissa and Felius follow Rupert to the continent of Elesius where a case of mistaken identity gets Clarissa involved in a political struggle over power and rule. The story as you can imagine is filled with a lot of political happenings and jargon.  Yet for what it's worth the story actually isn't bad.  The problem, however, is whether or not you'll be able to get the story to progress.

The game makes good use of the series Hex Battle system in a tactical way. Like every other Tactical RPG out there, you'll move and execute attacks.  Like Final Fantasy Tactics, there's a job system active in Wild Arms XF.  However, these aren't the same old ""Knight"" and ""Monk"" type of jobs.  They're jobs like ""Elementists"" who cast elemental magic spells and Fantastica that use support spells.  You'll start the game with four basic classes.  In addition to that, each of the story mode characters has a class completely unique to them.  You're able to learn abilities from each of the jobs and use them with other jobs upon doing so.  If you're familiar with the job system of Final Fantasy Tactics, then you're already more than prepared to tackle Wild Arms XF.  At least you would be were it not for the games shortcomings in the gameplay department.

Wild Arms has generally been a series that tries to separate itself from the crowd.  Needless to say XF tries to do so as well, however this is in the worst way.  Your characters have a stock of HP and MP, but they also have what is called VP.  VP stands for Vitality Points, and it drops with each turn.  When your VP runs out, your HP starts dropping each turn.  This little tactic was thrown in as a way to make you get through battles faster (or for the sake of being more realistic, I don't know).  However, it becomes more annoying than anything else.

What's even worse about the gameplay is the layout of the stages and the missions themselves.  All the missions have certain objectives.  Most of the time it is to defeat all the enemies, but on occasion you'll get special missions such as to free villagers from jail or to escort villagers across a map.  These missions however, aren't as fun and can sometimes be a test in frustration.

Another major issue with Wild Arms is simply that there isn't as much freedom as the player thinks there is.  Before each missions begins, you'll get an overview of the mission itself and hear suggestions on what you need to do.  In most RPGs where suggestions are thrown at you by the characters you can usually get by fine without using them.  Wild Arms XF, however, almost demands that you do.  In many cases, if you don't, the mission doesn't just raise up a little in difficulty, it actually goes sky high.  Some missions can't even be completed without taking their suggestions.  It's alright to give suggestions, but it seems downright wrong to punish the player for not taking them.  Luckily, you can always restart a mission.  And you'll probably have to.  The game doesn't just encourage you to use certain classes in a mission, it actually demands that you do.  Using certain classes feels more forced, especially early in the game.

An even bigger problem is probably that some missions seem more like they're dependent on trial and error rather than actual strategy.  Not luck, just trial and error.  Wild Arms XF clearly has a right and wrong way to do things but there isn't much variation in how you can do those things.  It's takes the game's suggestion or bust.  While some may like this idea of trial and error, memorization and brain teasing, others may feel restricted that there isn't much freedom to go about the mission the way you see fit.  It just seems wrong that not doing what the game suggest means you could fail a mission or have to restart.  It brings about an unusual imbalance to the games structure.

There are also little things in the gameplay that can make it frustrating.  The amount of times your attacks will miss some of your enemies is incredibly frustrating.  Another aspect is the limitation of items.  Characters can only equip a certain number of items when going into battle.  This wouldn't be such a big problem if you weren't forced to mow through those items so fast.

At the very least, however, Wild Arms XF does present a good challenge.  Much of it is from frustration, but you'll be surprised at the amount of thinking that is required to win each battle.  Unfortunately, each battle feels like a test, and it makes Wild Arms XF far less fun to play than other Strategy RPGs.

On the other hand, the game does have some amazing artwork.  The story is told through cutscenes similar to the ones you see in Disgaea.  Usually you'll see a portrait of the characters partaking in the event talking in front of a background.  These moments are stunning to look at.  There's a lot of anime inspired art here.  In battle itself doesn't look too amazing, however.  It's very colorful and decorated, with a lot of meticulous attention given to detail, but it hardly showcases what the PSP can do.  The game looks like it could've been released on the Gameboy Advance.  It also hurts the game that it doesn't run smoothly.  There are times when there will be slight hitches in the frame rate.  There are also moments when sound effects (notably the character's battle cries) are off.

Despite all that, the game sure sounds good.  There's a ton of good music here.  There's also some voice acting in the cutscenes and most of it isn't bad.  There are some moments when there could've been much more emotion, but often the voice acting isn't all that bad.  If you're not satisfied with the English voice overs, there's an option to change the voices to Japanese.  Characters also have voices in battle.  At first this isn't so bad, but it quickly becomes annoying.  Luckily, you're able to turn these voices off.

The PSP has a fair share of RPGs and Tactical RPGs.  Wild Arms XF is a game that had so much potential to be so much better.  Even die hard Wild Arms fans may not take much of a shine to it.  The game has an incredible story, incredible artwork and an incredible soundtrack, but those things can't make up for the dissatisfying gameplay.",3.0

"If you were a fan of Heavy Rain you'll probably be a fan of this game, just maybe a little less and in a more frustrating way. The storytelling while great isn't really a problem at all, most know the story of Jodie and get the basic premise of her and her supernatural friend just by playing the demo. But yes playing the full game obviously is the only way you can get the full story of course. I had a lot of store credit so I decided to use it towards this game since nothing really interesting IMO is coming out anytime soon. Heavy Rain was a breath of fresh air if you like interacting with an animated movie. This game is much the same. You do get ""some"" and I do mean very little chance to roam around without having quick time actions involved. Does this get old? Well yes and no. The controls are what I would call, using the word wonky. When you first starts especially with fighting, training and dodging it can be a real headache. Shake the controller, which doesn't always respond. Hit x and move the control stick (though which one?) during a slow motion sequence. I think you get the point. Heavy rain seemed much more refined and less hectic in it's controlled movements.

Graphically this game is far superior than about any game I've ever seen on PS3, and even some that i've seen on a high end gaming rig. That says a lot for PS3 and the question do we really need a PS4, with games like this? So basically you run through this girls life interacting with people trying to find out different aspects of the question why? Which I won't get into spoilers etc. Lets just say a lot of it is very engrossing, some of it is just annoying. When you move as the entity Aiden if you ""literally"" get motion sickness then you definitely want to steer clear of this game. Moving through walls, cars, people, and about everything you can while floating through the air while fun, is also very very sloppy. When you have to hold L1 and L2, hit buttons to make things move/or possess people it's not full proof. And sometimes very tedious. One example is when knocking over a vehicle it will pin point where/what you need to hit with a blue dot. It took about 10 minutes for me to finally get it in the right spot to flip it. Frankly because when I would try it just did not work. The same with many other scenes that come at you 100mph and you have to react. If you get it wrong you don't die, the story continues, but that may not have been the action you wanted. Sound more like a pain in the rear than a fun game? Well yes it's mostly true. Also I will mention the acting is superb, also with Willem Defoe as the creepy doctor he's very good.

But there is something endearing about going on the journey, and frankly more engrossing about it than Heavy Rain. I walked away from the game only to have it on my mind a few hours later. So I give it points for that. But overall I still prefer games like Drakes Fortune, The Last Of Us, Killzone, among other PS3 titles. This is a breath of fresh air for those who want a movie based game (to interact with) more so than a controllable game with just cut scene interactions. So don't buy this unless that's your cup of tea. It's not for everyone. Much like games for the wii people seem to sometimes/most times, want to just sit back take the controller and play. So remember before you drop 60$ on it. Am I sorry I did, well yes and no, I played the demo, so I wanted to continue and find out more. Much like the trailer from an interesting looking film. But it's no loss for me. It is what it is, and it's something new rather than the same ole FPS games. Which are getting older and older fast.

In summation, fun yet tedious, exciting yet exhausting, can literally cause you to be sick (don't play if you have seizures or severe motion sickness issues). You be the judge, I'm just a partial jury. Thanks.",3.0

"This review might sound a bit like the one from ""swingoutsisterguy,"" but I share a lot of the same opinions.  Don't get me wrong.  The graphics on this game are very nice, the sound quality is nice, and the gameplay could've been nice if I had been able to figure it out.

The main problem I had with it was I kept getting lost, even with using the map.  I'm sure this game is getting great reviews from others in the fact that the worlds are so large, but it didn't work very well for me, as a beginner.

Also, the gameplay was pretty awkward.  The bad guys in the game would walk right past me, and if I ignored them, they would leave me alone.  But if I started attacking them, which I assume was one of the points in the game, a million bad guys would come out of nowhere and kill me, even though I was shooting like crazy.

I do not get easily offended by profanity in movies and stuff, but I do not think profanity and video games mix, especially in animated adventure-type games.  That's another part of what made this game more unenjoyable.",3.0
"When I first got this game, I was addicted to it. I only wished I could play multiplayer more often (there's no bots).

Listen, I wanna give this game a four. It's just so fun! But there are numorous things that hold this game back from glory. Here's the breakdown:

Good:

.All the weapons you would expect, as well as some suprises

.For the most part, good multiplayer maps.

.Once upon a 2004-2006, there was online for this game

.DUEL WIELDING!!!!!!!!

.Uplink, Golden Gate Bridge, and Funhouse just rock

Bad:

.some glitches (no game freezes so far though, and one glitch is really interesting...see my discussion ""GoldenEye Glitches"")

.Single-player gets repetitive after a while, some levels too long

.thanks to the great planners at EA (yeah right), online has been shut down for PS2 as of 11/17/06 (PS3 launch)

You may notice the lack of ""bad"" things. The reason I give this game a three and not a four is because there isn't anything in this game that another game doesn't do better. But this game is still really fun, and you should rent it (for GC, PS2, Xbox). Peace out :).",3.0

"I'm happy I didn't pay $60 for this game. It isn't a horrible game, there were just a few too many times I felt like hurling the controller at the tv. The shooting was one of the big problems, it was better than Far Cry 2, but still frustrating. Let me ask you something, has there ever been a game in History that was more enjoyable because there are enemies in it that you have to empty several magazines directly into the guy's head just so he'll die? Granted, Ubi-soft is Canadian, and you shouldn't make racing games if you take the bus to work, but I haven't played a Ubi-soft game were you can pull the trigger while aiming directly at someones head and he'll just friggen die! Most video games I've played anymore can't just have simple tasks for you to do. Not easy, just simple. You can't just walk up the stairs of a tower, you have to climb a ladder to this height, then a rope to this one, then take the stairs two floors, then climb an other ladder. It retarded.

After the irratating things, though, it was better to have played it than not to have. If you liked the big open world of Far Cry 2, you'll love this one. There's some cool weapons, and it has a decent story. I'm not sure why Ubi-soft's main charicters always have to be whiny little prison b*@&%es anymore, but it's not so horrible on this one you mind.

"I really, really want to love this game... but I can't.  Part of it is because of the Batmobile.  I know, I know, a lot of you are going to stick up for it, and that's cool, but it was REPETITIVE.  Look, I liked the idea of getting to drive the Batmobile.  I was excited.  Then I got the game, and realized that you have to use the Batmobile for EVERYTHING.  I mean, having it just to drive around would be cool;  having it for a few missions would have been cool.  But, to have it for nearly every mission is way too much, IMO.

Honestly, having Gotham look as beautiful as it looks in this game, makes me want the Batmobile that much less.  The detail in this game is outstanding, but, you only get to see it a few times, (if you're playing the missions, and not just gliding around).  A lot of the side missions felt like just crappy DLC.  This game was advertised as having all the Rogues Gallery.  And it did, but only for really small cameos.  The trailer had me believe that I would be facing each one, like a boss battle.

And that brings me to my next peeve of this game.  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  (I won't say who the bosses are).

You have two of the boss battles in knock 'em down, drag 'em outs, right?  Nope, you fight in the Batmobile's battle mode.  WHAT?

A few other things I didn't like about the game is 1) the developers sorta lied about the Arkham Knight.  If you're a fan of Batman, you'll know after a few minutes who the AK is.  I was annoyed by this, because we were told he/she was a NEW character.  Nope, we got lied to.  Maybe I misread, or was mislead by some articles I read, but this is what I believed.  Did it ruin the game for me?  No, but they had so much potential to have a new villain added to Batman's list of baddies.  2)  (2 and 3 are related)  The Riddler.  Okay, Asylum was cool having you find Riddlers things.  City went a bit further with adding more, and making you think about how to get them.  Origin, well, whatever.  This game has 243 (I think that's right) Riddler doodads all over the freaking city.  I'm not a trophy hunter.  I don't have to get 100% on the games I play.  Others do, and that's your right.  I like that games give you a lot of content for a reasonable price.  Having said that, I don't like that I have to 100% the game to get...

 ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The TRUE ending.  What kind of crap is that?  Why should I have to do missions I don't care about just to get an ending that really doesn't prove that the story has ended.  It seems to me like some developers are still chomping at the bit to make more of the Batman stories.

All in all, I can't say I love this game.  While there are a few ""fun"" parts in the game, the overall story, repetitive missions, lackluster boss fights, and forcing me into 100%ing the game, just makes me not like this game as much as the earlier installments.  If they do make more, I hope they will step up their game.",3.0

"There is a solid platform here, there was a lot of potential that clearly wasn't used here. The game is a lot of fun for the first 2 weeks. After that it gets really repetitive. The same mobs and missions over and over just in different areas that seems to look all alike. Not much when into the bosses into this game they all seem to be bullet sponges with no real mechanics. I would say leveling is probably the funniest thing about this game. Once you hit lvl 30 it's time to get farmed by other players.

 You do all this work and get rewared to a pom pom beanie? Who cares about a white puffy jacket with my walnut pom pom beanie. So once I hit lvl 30 I decided to try out the so called awesome Dark Zone, only to get farmed by other players who seems to put 100 of hrs into this game. Even if you're in the dark zone with a group of 4 players you'll get wiped by some player who is lv 99 dark zone. The problem with a lot of these games are they seem to try to appeal to pvp players and have no regards to pve players. All the good loot drops in the dark zone so if you're not a good pvper don't bother buying this game because you'll get famred by players and lose all your stuff. There is really nothing to do in the dark zone but kill Mobs no quests inside No missions nothing but farm npc and players. Not to mention the Map for the whole game is really small and the dark zone is even smaller. Not much though when into this game as a whole, I don't know how many times I killed an Npc named Alex. This game is nothing like the orginal trailer they first released. They lied.

Pros: Leveling and Doing main missons (as there are only like 7 main missions) Fire fights are pretty awesome I'm not going to lie there. The guns look sick. Building your base up. Modify weapons.

Cons: Same looking areas, same looking mobs over and over. same type of missions over and over. Alot of npc named Alex. Crafting is pointless when all the top gear drops or is bought in dark zone. Getting farmed by players who have no life. I mean how do you kill which has no life? literally!

"I could break this down, but why repeat what has already been said?  Sportduke's review of June 19, 2005 basically says close to what I would have said if I took the time to dissect this more carefully.  I have owned at one time or another every Medal of Honor or Call of Duty game and have beaten all of them pretty easily, all on hard mode.

I do like some aspects of the game.  I usually play stand-a-lone but recently my brother-in-law was visiting and we spent hours blowing each other up in the multi-player levels.  That was a lot of fun!  (Hmmm...maybe the Jack Daniels had something to do with it as well?)

The missions themselves are OK, but on some levels (Russian Front) I found myself running out of ammo, and then getting blown away trying to find the ammo that shows up when you knock off an enemy soldier.  Yeah, crouching and ducking work well, but when you are out of ammo, butting an enemy (who, by the way, has a loaded weapon) on the head with your rifle stock will only get you so far.  I notice the enemy soldiers never seem to run out of ammo!

My squad was basically a nuisance.  I did note that now and then they would actually clear out enemies, but I spent most of my time positioning them behind me to keep the stupid-so-and-so's from running in front of machine gun fire.  Healing them took up precious first aid kits and I really didn't see much value in keeping them alive (I think I did so out of guilt).  At the very final level they walk with you to the bunker, then disappear.  Thanks guys!

The ""adrenaline"" feature was of minor use.  I don't think it was fair that if I lost one of my lives, my ""adrenaline"" went with it, leaving me to start popping at enemy soldiers until I could build it back up.

The lack of save points is my biggest gripe.  I kept getting to the end of the game, that bunker on the final level, where in seconds I would go through all my ""extra"" lives and first-aid kits and still not have a chance.  Then, it would be back to the start of the mission.  No thanks.  I finally beat the damn game, but unlike MOH: Frontline, it's off to Amazon Marketplace for this one.",3.0

"I need to preface this with saying that I love D&D, and I love fighting through dungeons. Any game that lets you set the character's armor and weapons makes me happy.
I really liked D&DH when I started playing it, but it became repetitive after the first few hours. I finished it, but quickly traded it in. Read on for the reasons why...
You are one of a band of heroes raised from the dead to fight an evil warrior you defeated years before. His power is legendary, and it is believed that only you (and your friends, if you are playing multiplayer) can defeat this undead hellion. He has, of course, unleashed a pride of monsters upon the various worlds you must travel to find his lair.
Characters
The characters in this game are good, keeping in tune with traditional D&D classes. I played through as the human Warrior (I mean ''Fighter''), my hack-'n'-slash favorite. You can also choose from Rogue, Wizard, or Cleric. Other than the players, the NPCs are well animated, but their character development is pretty two-dimensional.
Bad Guys, Monsters, and [SPOILER]s, Oh My!
Ok, I won't spoil my favorite part of the game for you. Let me just say that some of the monsters that appeared brought back some great PC/earlier console memories. There's nothing better than beating a monster easily that has kicked your backside before, and there is plenty of this in this game. The monsters are well animated, and have decent sound effects. It would be nice if there was additional variation within levels (rather than just among levels), but overall there are is a wide variety to kill.
In other graphic/sound areas: The NPC voices are good, and well cast. The animations for fighting and spell casting are nice, but are not unique to D&DH.
Will This Gather Dust?
I traded it in after finishing it in one week, so it might be gathering dust at the store -- I don't know! I have absolutely no desire to play it again, because the repetitive hacking and slashing became tiresome the FIRST time through. Only about 20 hours worth of playing time, but I only played through as the Fighter (thank goodness)! There is nothing new in this game, but that may not be a bad thing, depending on your taste...
Overall Recommendation:
If you like Diablo, you'll like this.
If you liked playing earlier D&D games, you'll like this.
If you like pushing one button to attack and another, occasionally, to use a health potion, you'll like this.",3.0
"I was expecting to have a lot more fun with this game than I experienced.  While the games graphics are beautiful to behold, the overall experience was like watching a large cinematic cartoon.  The gameplay controls were somewhat clumsy and I must say, I had much more fun playing James Bond 007 BloodStone as so far as third person shooters are concerned.  At least that game took itself seriously!  I wonder what age group this game was written for...",3.0
"First of all let me point out the fact that Silent Hill is alot of fun no matter how you shake it. Now to my points, lets first discuss how funny it is that people claim how ""Scary"" this game is. In honest opinion this game is not as scary as the reviews would have you think. I'd say it's more disturbing than scary and this points to my only true gripe about the game. This ""Disturbing"" effect wares away after awhile, it does and when it does, out goes the ""Horror"" that you are supposed to feel.

Now don't get mad at me Silent Hill Fanboys! I did say the game was fun no matter how you shake it up... and that's the truth. Silent Hill for it's time was a game that stood under the HUGE shadow of Resident Evil. With respects it cast it's own light for it's fans BUT you cannot compare Silent Hill and Resident Evil as the same thing. Neither is really better than the other... it all depends on what you want to get your heart pounding (And NO Silent Hill is not for a more mature level of player Ha Ha both games are on the same level!) so go for the game if you wish to play a classic or looking for a quick thrill.

Now to sum up the ending of my rant/review I'd have to say the reason this game received a 3 is because in truth the sound and graphics are sub-par. The storyline is at best mediocre and it will have you shaking your head in the end (I had to find a website dedicated to explaining the storyline for this game... yeah that bad!). I know I know... it's dated... blah blah blah... but seriously what scared you more? Harry's funny running graphics or the silly looking demon-dogs? As I've said to friends, it's the initial shock of seeing something you had not seen before.

So thats it... I hope you buy this title as it does deserve a play through. However if your looking for a ""Scary"" and or ""Horror"" game I'd suggest you either pick up Silent Hill 2 or Resident Evil 4. They are scary at times and without the hassle of the almost unplayable, ANNOYING and POINTLESS puzzles alocated throughout Silent Hill.

Oh and one more thing... I saw today Monday April 24th 2006 that this game was selling USED for $78.00!! Ha Ha I would NEVER buy a PSX 1 game for that price! Don't be suckered into that rip off!",3.0
"Battleship for Xbox 360 is not too bad for a film based tie in title. We all know film related games are usually not of the same quality as most games. The game does not really follow any plot from the film, but lets us play some kind of parallel story where you run around the Hawaii Islands with guns and at the same time control the huge American ships that are in the water around the Island. You hide behind a rock and open your interface. There you see the map of the area, your location, the enemy ships, and your ships. You can order your ships to move closer to the enemy to attack them while you shoot aliens in FPS gameplay mode on land.

Battleship XBOX 360 almost pulls it off with this cool concept. Graphics are not too bad. You are treated to visuals of a tropical island and cool alien and earth ships on the water in the ocean. What could be wrong with this?

Simply that the game is not polished and has a lot of bugs. You know how sometimes you want to explore the game area by going to extreme edges of the maps? Well if you do it here, you will find so many invisible walls you'll lose count. When there is supposed to be collision with some rock or cliffs you'll hit an invisible wall because the developers either were lazy, or did not have the time to create proper collision.
The guns are not very balanced. The alien gun and the M16 variant of human weapon just shoot directly. Generally very accurate, but not realistic  hit detection like in Call of Duty for example. You are able to aim down iron sights, but still the guns are too perfect they feel like toys.
The enemy AI is rather dumb. They'll often just bunch together and just shoot directly. There is no strategy in them.
There are also rocks and spots in which you can get stuck and would have to restart the level to continue.
The game is also not very hard on Hardest difficulty.

Still it is somewhat fun to play because of the ships strategy. Some cutscenes are cool, alien ships drop off troops very impressively. Achievements are easy and if you collect them they are valuable.",3.0

"First off i'd like to say that as gaming veteran, this game reaches that standard. However, it's not as fun as it appears to be, or as some of the game-play wants you to believe.

The game is mediocre at best, when you compare it to other FPS's such as BF II, BFBC, COD, HALO Franchise, etc etc etc...

Now don't get me wrong, the combat style of play can bring hours of fun, but it turns into the same old boring and repetitive style of ""Move to the enemy flag, take the flag, move to the enemy base, take the base."" combat.

Pro's: Sound effects are great, killing animation is very realistic, the online ranking system is perfect, and the background can at some times look real.

Con's: Terrible tech support, lags constantly when online (and I have a very expensive and functional conn so I know it's the servers), you can only benefit from this game if you play online, glitches in multiple areas, air combat is lacking in a few key areas, and the list goes on...

If you want a classic FPS, and do not intend on ENJOYING yourself online, then this is for YOU. But, if you really want to have a fun online FPS experience, i'd suggest you move to one of the new FPS's that are out, or if you don't want that, stick with something that is mentally challenging and won't kill you stress wise in the process.",3.0
"My experencies are similar to what other people have written.  When you get the gameplay, the game is extremely fun.  However, there are way too many movie cutscenes.  Some of them are extremely long.  Most of them I ended up skipping through either because I didn't have over a half hour to sit there and watch, or  it just plain got boring.
The difficulty on normal seemed to be pretty good.  It was challenging at times, but not so difficult where you absolutely had to go and get a strategy guide.
Overall, a great game, but the combination of long winded movie scenes and short actual gameplay cause this to get a much lower rating than it otherwise might have had.  Especially if you are willing to skip the movie scenes, you would be much better off just renting this game.  You could beat it in that time period with no problem.",3.0

"Any big name release with a lot of hype will inevitably bring with it some degree of backlash. But which do you believe? In the case of Doom 3 a little of both is probably a good idea. This title nails a lot of aspects necessary for an amazing game experiance. It also has its fair share of irritating (and one would think easy to avoid) faults bogging it down.

In particular, the atmosphere in this game is intensely gripping. the audio ambience combined with the dynamic lighting and enemy use of the dark makes this a pretty terrifying game to play. It succeeds wildly in transporting you inside a sci-fi horror film. Of course it's pretty much a straight nod to the Alien franchise in that way - the story is nowhere as solid (although thank heavens the voice acting is competent.) But inasmuch as Doom 3 instils in the player the visceral sensations of being hunted by bogeymen in the dark, the horror element here is pure gold.

The engine is fairly realistic and all around solid. Apparently the pc version has occasional framrate problems but you will find no such issues in the Xbox version. I went from end to end of this game's campaign mode without a single lock-up or slow-down. The character models behave in 3D space in a surprisingly convincing manner. The bump-mapping is phenomenal and no corners were cut on the visual production. The artistic updates on various enemies and weapons were well done and sensible.

A number of fairly stupid design problems do hinder the overall experiance though. For example, as the game progresses you will start to find unavoidable situations that force you to platform in first person. That's generally considered a huge no-no in first person shooters and was completely avoidable. Also, the level designs are occasionally redundent, particularely early on in the game when the story gives you no real clear goal.

Additionally, the menu system is uncomfortably sluggish. It may not sound like a big deal that it takes 1.5 seconds to go from menu to menu instead of .5 seconds, but when you're really immersed in the gameplay and you just want to customize the D-Pad weapons really quick in the middle of a fight or make a just-in-case save file, it stacks up. Another similar frustration comes in the form of save file load times. Although the ability to save at any place in the game may seem desirable, it results in a lot of time wasted staring at load screens later on in the game when you may need to retry particularely difficult passages or bosses over and over. Some sort of checkpoint system would have eliminated this flaw, even if only implemented in particular trouble spots. Besides these technical issues, there are a number of little spots in the gameplay where goals are ambiguous and general level design works against you in a way that feels distinctly unintentional.

The special edition features are decent. It does come with full emulations of the original two doom games as well as a smattering of somewhat informative interviews and other video features. Still, there isn't anything of mindblowing proportions here so if you're the frugal type you won't be missing anything by opting for the basic edition.

There aren't any especially good arguments against playing this game; it accomplishes its main goal as a horror fps quite well. At the very least it's worth a rental. The flaws keep it from being a hall of fame game but they certainly don't ruin what is mostly an enjoyable and convincing game with a well-balanced fps set up.",3.0

"Never really been a huge fan or Forza, Need for Speed, or the Gran Turismo games, but they can be enjoyable for a little while. Basically games like this are for people who just wanna drive, which can be quite fun, yet takes a special person to really just sit and have a mid paced race. No, its not Motorstorm, or Burnout, its just a beautiful looking game with all kinds of customizable cars to unlock and have fun with. I played the demo, went through it a couple times, had some fun and watched the replay, enjoyed it, then deleted it. I think games like these should be cheaper or just made downloadable on consoles. The graphics are definitely top notch, and some of the best looking on any console to date, hense why it was up for best graphics technical this year. Also when you hit things the dents stay, or scruff up your car which makes for a realistic ride overall. I can only recommend this game to fans of car and driver magazine, because basically you make your dream car, and have a little race with it, thats pretty much it. So for the fans of driving its great, for hardcore racing fans, stick with Burnout, Motorstorms, or even the off road seris of games. Still a decent ride though.",3.0

I was looking forward to this game more than about any other this year.... until just recently when I found out they GREATLY downgraded the PC graphics to cater to the lowest common denominator (underpowered consoles). See this site for the gory details: http://www.gamezone.com/originals/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-betrayed-by-ambition-jtq9

The developer is also on record from the end of last year claiming that the PC version would not suffer any graphical downgrades. We were blatantly lied to. I am going to be demanding a refund from Steam for this false advertisement.

Also, the controls on the keyboard and mouse are unnecessarily complex. If you buy this game understand that you will need to use a gamepad. Another sign of consolitus.",3.0
"I've played to level forty so I can't say it's no fun at all.  It's unrealistic in that there are brutes, men who eat steriods three meals a day, who appear to make the gang fights cartoonish and stupid.  It's juevenille in it's attitude toward women and sex, although some reviews say it's mature.  Being unfit for kids doesn't make it mature.
The driving is fun and the cars handle well.  The flying isn't fun because the aircraft are slow and the controls sloppy.  The boats are okay, but their is a serious glitch that makes them stutter and almost stall at certain times.  Any basic test of the game would have shown that, but they decided to leave it in.
Any time you injure another gang member or cop, you are chased and attacked relentlessly.  They always know where you are.  Two cops zoom up in a car and you quickly shoot them and then run down alleys and back roads, steal five cars and race accross town.  They are right behind you all the way, every single time.  There is no subtlety at all.  Some cars are very fast and some trucks are slow.  Bad guys in a slow truck always keep right behind a fast car.  Always.
If you try being a sniper, the people and cars in the distance disappear - another glitch.
You can buy property which earns money.  In a town the size of San Fransisco you can buy maybe fifty stores, because fake computer stores are just too expensive to put all over the place.  You can go into your stores, but not the other 99% of the buildings. You only earn money by jumping through the game's hoops.  I can't swear to it, but I think that you don't earn what your supposed to, due to the game developers being so bad a math and, well, computer stuff.
You can destroy vehicles and kill people, but don't try shooting out a store window because you can't.  There are ten year old games in which you can,  but not this one.  Also tough gang members can't push chairs out of the way or get over a street curb without jumping.

"I've been more and more video games, thanks to a half-off rental deal, and finally pulled Mirror's Edge out of curiousity and a desire for something beyond Gears of War 2 and Fallout 3 (two games I like way more than this one).  The presentation is unique and it was a plus for me.  Everything from the menus to the levels and characters has a very distinct look about them and I like the cutscene animations, too.

The tutorial is a good level where you learn the basics and the first level I played through was pretty exciting.  Until the last portion of the first level where your boss tells you over your radio: ""get out of there, I don't care how, just get out of there"" To me this is an invitation to get a little creative and see what ways I can get off the building while you have cops storming the building and shooting you.  The catch is that there is only one way off that building.  You don't really have a choice or any alternate route, you have one jump to make to get off that building and that's it.  Oh, you'll die 20 times trying to make that jump, but once you realize that the game is essentially you running on rails and getting punished for it, it loses a lot of its charm.

There is, at its heart, a great idea.  And I can imagine gameplay like this in Grand Theft Auto's world would be sweet (Niko and Johnny are both pretty clunky compared to Faith's smooth moves).  Its a shame the only way they could build up the challenge was to kill the player like its going out of style (if I want to die, I'd go play a multiplayer FPS).  Seriously, this game is a $50 version of Pitfall.  I'm sure whatever sequel comes along will address these issues and I have higher hopes for the future.",3.0

Can't enter in password using this device and it locks out the other controller. So I have to disable my combo and then launch the game. Major oversight by Microsoft engineers who designed this piece of junk.

Bumpers also used in this game for nitro and I have to remap everything, since I lose two buttons. Also no look left and right in cockpit view. Microsoft needs to patch all the racing games to work with this device. On that note, it does provide better control of the cars.",3.0
"When the game started out I was actually impressed and having fun in the world and was excited to play on...then as I progressed the game got boring and boring and boring. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad game but the fact that it reminds me of some other games yet fails to be like them leads to a disappointing experience.

The combat is very similar to the Batman games but just not as fun as when your actually Batman. The stealth and sneaking tries to take a page from AC series but again just not as good as the original. The environment is just so bland and boring. I didn't feel like doing anything in such an environment, whereas in other games the environment makes the player want to explore etc.

The nemesis/revenge aspect of the game is fun in the beginning but boy does it lose its fun factor quick. For me the whole concept actually became irritating and annoying. Imagine this, your fighting one of the captains and you take out almost all the minions and focus back on the captain...suddenly a random minion gets a cheap shot on you and you die. That minion gets promoted and whatnot and is added to your list of people you need to get revenge on. This system while interesting at first just got super boring fast.

Also the mini cut-scenes while fighting got very distracting and sometimes even lead to death since your character was in the middle of a counter.
The side quests were forgettable, the story was ehhhhhhhhhhh.

Overall I regret my purchase of this game because mainly I just found it boring. I am shocked that some websites gave it GOTY. Again not a bad game because technically it works but bored my brains out.",3.0
"I have never played the original Condemned, so starting off with the sequel with already developed characters was a bit disorientating. I had absolutely no idea what to expect from this game, but for 5 I couldn't refuse, especially after the disappointing Resident Evil 5.

In Condemned 2 you play Ethan Thomas, a burnt-out drunk and former special agent. When people across the unnamed city start to go crazy you're brought in to kick some ass and find out why.

The game is set in the ugliest of places, from abandoned hotels, factories, back alleys. Everything is dank and depressing. The graphics are not the best but sure do impress with their grottiness. What IS remarkable though is the gut-wrenching sound design, which is not only the best video game sound I have ever heard but would rival the most superior of Hollywood horrors. If you have a home theatre hooked up to your PS3 then be prepared for a horrifying atmosphere made entirely of sound to flood into your living room.

But...a first person beat-em-up? I understand that the FP perspective makes the game even scarier, but it just doesn't fit a beat-em-up. When fighting bad guys your chances are almost down to luck with skill being nearly irrelevant.

However, since I was very much let down by RE5 I was surprised just how shocking and creepy Condemned 2 was. I was well worth the money and I recommend it despite it's flaws.

Pros:

Disgusting production design that will make you head straight for the shower.

Truly menacing sound.

Cons:

Clunky fight system

"The latest installment in the series is, unfortunately, not the best.  The combat combinations of guns and magic--first ""plasmids"" and now ""tonics""--becomes repitious and tedious quickly, and there is nothing novel to freshen things up later in the game.  For example, throwing fireballs is fun at first, but once it grows old, your only options are to switch to electric or ""air"" versions of the same tonic.  To be fair, a few of the tonics have unique mechanics, but on the other hand, which is less tedious: shooting 50 enemies to death with your pistol, or shooting 50 enemies to death with a lightning bolt.  If the the AI was more aggressive, or the combat was more tactical, it might keep my attention, but as it is I became bored quickly--even with the game on the Hard difficulty.

This leaves the game's sole appeal the story, which is also lacking.  The ending in particular will leave most people underwhelmed, and there are fewer moments of excellent atmosphere than there have been in previous games.  Besides, many of themes are also borrowed from the first Bioshock, which may be fitting, but it also feels stale in places.

Overall, I cannot recommend this game at full price, and I give it a 6/10.  It's not a bad game, but it is mediocre.  If you're a die-hard fan of Levine, do yourself a favor and wait for a price drop.",3.0
"Although very ""cheesy"" to a large degree, I think the game well captured the ""Bond Experience"" with many of the exciting set piece levels within the game.

Also, for me playing a game as a ""super spy,"" going stealth was sometimes a pain to pull off during some missions because the enemies are usually there just waiting for me to ""go around that corner"" or ""open that door"" so that they can get me. The music, character models, hand to hand combat, and shooting mechanics though, were all well done. The opening theme song sung by Mya was the best thing I liked about the game. It's a good game to play, and i'm sure people who play it will have fun with it if they are into James Bond.",3.0

"I'd been eagerly anticipating this game's release for a very long time.  The subject matter, art, music, and voice talent in the game had me really excited.  The demo grabbed me from start to finish, and convinced me that this was a no-brainer kind of buy. It was fun and funny and seemed to be a great hack & slash kind of experience - sort of a Devil May Cry with metal kind of game, with a little tag-team action and some driving.

WRONG.

Most of the action is RTS-style: building resources, commanding troops, etc.  I absolutely hate that kind of game.  Honestly, I'm giving the game 3 stars for the art, music, and voice talent, because I truly can't stand the gameplay.

You may say that I shouldn't give a game a low review if I don't like that genre of gaming - which would be true if the demo wasn't so misleading.  And again, its a fun game if you're into RTS.  If not, avoid it.",3.0

"Left4Dead 2 is a game that many tossed off with mixed reviews. Some hated Valve for making this game instead of creating it as an add-on DLC for the original game.

Thankfully Valve did what they wanted to.

- First and formost improvement is the graphics. In this you will see more viseral damage, more blood, and bodies even fly now when explosions go off.

- Melee weapons. Nothing has been more satisfying than being able to bash, hit, chop, and slap zombies with various melee objects like machetes, frying pans, and baseball bats.

- Multiple paths. While not overly appearant, the ""Director"" can sometimes change up small pathways throughout a map. While not overly revolutionary it does on occasion make for a nice change of scenery.

Another factor of note is the game takes place during the light of day in various campaigns but its a welcome change of pace.

Now for the gripe (and ultimately why I give this game 3 stars on this version. Let's face it, the majority of prefer to play with human beings rather than the AI. Most of us go to play this online. While this game is enjoyable both on the PC and the Xbox 360, the 360 version has the worst community between the two.

On the 360, one console can host two people online. This has lead to numerous unfair ""vote kicks"" as two people can come into the game, start a vote to kick one of the other two players and succeed. This has lead to numerous accounts of griefing and unfair play overall for the game. Nothing sucks more than putting a lot of effort into a campaign only to have a 2-fer join in from one console and destroy the team. The only real way to combat this is to host private matches with friends only.

Some will argue that this does not factor in nor have anything to do with the game itself but I state that it does, since the majority of people who play L4D2 do so online, with other people. Online, the game is only as fun as the people you play with. Online you will all be put into situations and encounters together that you will eventually end up sharing with other like minded fans.

(Example: Running low on ammo and health with two people on the ground dying and one dead, with one left standing and fending off special infected and hoard that has come charing in. You managed to get the first player back on their feet who then goes over to revive the player. Just as the second character begins to 'black out', you manage to just barely save them. That's something the game AI cannot reproduce.)

If you buy this version of L4D2 and don't mind this kind of interrupted risk, then by all means get this game. Ultimately the game is fun on both PC and Xbox versions, the only thing seperating them is the community and the experiences you will have in online play with each.",3.0
"I was pretty excited for this game.  I'm a big fan of the other Batman: Arkham games.  This one just doesn't measure up.  Combat is overly simple.  I never felt the need to go beyond basic punch, counter combos with the occasional cape sweep on those few enemies the required it.  While in the other Arkham games, you'll beat up hordes of enemies, there really are not that many fights in this one.  There are not that many stealth portions either.  And if you flub most of them up, you can just punch your way out.  No puzzles really either.  It's all quite straight forward.  The game is pretty short at 8-10 hours.  In order to 100% the game, you must beat it 3 times.

There are some redeeming qualities.  The game is fun to play, and because it's short, you don't really get too bored with the combat.  The boss battles are quite well done for the most part.  The game looks pretty decent on the vita.

The story has some good elements to it, but really its not very substantial.  Those that know something about the DCU will see the story well ahead and know what is going on (except possibly for the small ""twist"" in the arkham wing), but those that don't know the DCU still won't know what's going on at the end and the story will feel really hollow to them.  The short story here is really just a setup for a future game, and it definitely feels that way.

So all in all, its ok.  Just ok.  Probably worth $10-15.  I would have been pretty upset buying it for full price at launch though.",3.0
"First let me state that I don't actually have a Wii U console. I bought this controller in anticipation of a new adapter Mayflash is releasing for this controller that will convert up to 4 of them to Windows Direct Input (usb Human Interface) devices, similar to their previous adapters for the original Classic Controller, so I will be reviewing this controller entirely on how it 'feels', rather than nagging about compatibility issues across the Wii U and original Wii game library (like the fact the Wii U Pro can't be used with the Virtual Console -- Ummm, lolwhut? Guess they still want to milk their player base by continuing to sell the old Pro controller and $39 Wiimotes for it to connect to). -- I primarily play retro games on PC, so I'm reviewing it with that in mind...

People say this is just a clone of the Xbox controller, but I'd say it's more just a rehash of the Classic Controller Pro with the stick and button arrangements reversed. At times this is comfortable (if you're primarily using the sticks, resting your thumb tips over both sticks does feel very natural and comfortable).

If you were playing with the Dpad and 4 face buttons, let's say you're playing Super Mario World where Y is run and B is jump, and you use a technique like mine (sorry, let me rephrase, every person who's ever had an SNES and played -any- sidescrolling platformer games on it) where you use the tip of your thumb to hold down Y and use the butt of your thumb to hit B, you're going to need to slide your hands a little bit down the handles to get a decent angle.

If you're using the left stick to move around and do this same technique, it doesn't feel quite right, you lose some of your grip in the process of jutting the butt of your thumb out at the B button while also moving the stick (which you're only getting with the side of your thumb since it's so high up there). If you do the same technique on X and A instead, it's not quite so bad. Let me just say, thank goodness for remapping on PC.

Now let's say you're playing one of the Mega Man X type games where your R button is your Dash and you want to do a 'Dash Jump' (gives your jump more momentum, thus carrying you over large holes in the level, or over enemies). You have to move left or right, press R and then B right after. Doing this is actually a little uncomfortable, given the way your thumb tilts on its side as your trying to get your hand arched enough to be able to hit R with your index finger and B with your thumb.

Again, if you remapped and replaced Y and B with X and A, this isn't too uncomfortable. So at least it's a good thing that I will have that option when I use this controller on PC (an option Ninty would've been wise to include back in the early days of the old Wii when you got forced to use B and A instead of the easier Y and B when you played an NES game with the Classic Controller).

Now, as for the controller build, people say this controller feels really light, honestly I think it has a fair amount of heft to it (unlike the older Pro controller for original Wii which felt pretty hollow, probably has to do with the battery pack and rumble). The plastic feels fairly thick and it doesn't feel like it's going to 'snap in half' if I twist my hands the wrong way, as one writer on Kotaku joked.

But this controller --does-- hold some pretty big disappointments, at least for me.

The zL and zR buttons have a stuck out bottom bit which gives the illusion these triggers are spring-loaded analogs, but they're in fact digital. Now, I have no problem at all with digital buttons, I love them and I prefer them, but if they were going to do that, then they should've just stuck with the shape of the zL and zR that were on the old Pro controller for the previous Wii console (or the L2 and R2 of the Dual Shock PS2 controllers, which were about the same shape), those little nubs jutting out at the bottoms just make the buttons feel weird. They also never really depress the same way twice. It's like the rubber behind the button gets shifted around and thus the depression point doesn't always hit the 'sweet spot' on the top of the rubber.

The L and R buttons don't feel much better. I barely feel anything at all when I depress them. It's almost as bad as the 'bumpers' on the Xbox 360 controllers, minus that horrible and all too familiar 'mouse click' feeling.

The YXBA buttons are smaller, even smaller than what they were on the Pro controller for the old Wii, and they lack that resistant 'pop' of the taller, wider YXBA's on the old flat, handleless controller. They're so small and so squishy feeling that they feel like the buttons from a 3DS, even the buttons on the Wii U Gamepad (aka the Tablet) feel better than these buttons and feel like they're a bit bigger and taller too.

One area they did manage to improve is the Dpad, this actually has some good 'pop' to it, not quite as poppy as the old old oooollllld DS's Dpad (which had clickers under each direction like PSP / PSvita), and not nearly as nice for circles as the Tablet controller's Dpad (which is so nice and tall and swivels so nicely on its center axis, it almost feels like the Dreamcast's Dpad), but it's still good and certainly way better than the one on the previous Pro which just felt loose and jiggled around in its housing.

Start and Select have been given digital rubber buttons in place of the hard clickers from the controllers before and it's about damn time. It's too bad they didn't think to do that on the original flat Classic (or do the same to its zL and zR buttons, as it sure would've been nice to have 'real' buttons for those two instead of what amounted to the hard clickers out of a PC mouse - srsly, I've taken flatties apart and they're pretty close to the same mechanism as a mouse button, no joke).

The analog sticks have click-in tops (like PS2, PS3, Xbox etc). Seems Ninty is in the habit of coming up with tweaks they -should have- included on their first incarnation Classic Controllers... the sticks themselves feel loose, weak, they have little to no resistance. Even weaker than the sticks on the previous Pro controller. The sticks on the flat Classics were tighter. When I pull back a stick and let it fly back into place, I wanna hear it make some noise, not just a soft, barely audible 'click.'

The few things I can see good about this controller (not having a wire in the way, not being tethered to a Wiimote, or in my case, a Mayflash adapter base) are positives, but the negatives don't really make me want to use this more than my old flatties (which feel loads more durable and have that 'spring' and 'pop' that I desire). It's pretty disappointing that a controller that was $19, which came out in 2006 can actually feel better than a brand new controller that costs $50.

Now, I'm probably expecting entirely the wrong thing out of the Wii U Pro controller, since it's likely meant for the modern FPS titles and 3D games, and it will probably work just fine for those, but I kind of expected more out of Nintendo. When I held and played around with the Tablet, that actually felt like they put some work and thought into it, everything on that feels fantastic, and of course it should, it's the -main- peripheral they want you to play with and it's a $70-90 controller, of course they'd throw all their quality control into it instead of focusing on 'aging' tech like old-school controllers.

Hopefully the third party developers will start cranking out better feeling controllers, ones that'll still be detectable as Wii U Pro controllers (so they will hopefully still sync up with the soon to be released Mayflash adapter).",3.0
"Lots of recycling from previous game. It's a fun game, but it feels like playing Megaman 6 after playing Megaman 1 to 5. It's just... more of it. Not really worth the day one price, but if you find it under 30 bucks and liked the previous games, snatch it.",3.0
