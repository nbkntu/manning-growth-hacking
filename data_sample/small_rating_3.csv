"I tried this with Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. The wheel is not officially detected in this game or others. It was detected as the older wheel, not the ""speed wheel"". Also a major overlook is no bumper buttons! When I start the game, I have to log into my profile. But I have my Xbox live account protected by a button combination that includes the bumper buttons. Can't enter in password using this device and it locks out the other controller. So I have to disable my combo and then launch the game. Major oversight by Microsoft engineers who designed this piece of junk.

Bumpers also used in this game for nitro and I have to remap everything, since I lose two buttons. Also no look left and right in cockpit view. Microsoft needs to patch all the racing games to work with this device. On that note, it does provide better control of the cars.",3.0
"Well, it seems to be a button masher. Got game really cheap, so i thought i would give it a try since i had heard of game alot, but never played. Positives are it is really pretty simple to play and has some hours a mindless fun. Music is pretty good and i sort of likes the throwback feel. Negatives are, it seems like a game out of the 80's or something. Very simple, combat is pretty bad , weapons generally act the same, extremely repetitive. Compared to demons souls or dark souls not only is combat not even close to as good, nor graphics or complexity nor replayability. Why am i giving this really repetitive old feeling game a decent rating of a 3. Well, it is nice to get away from games that are complex and take forethought. You pretty much just hack and slash. By the way, borderlands is way better than this. I would say get this for around twenty dollars or so and its worth it for a short term diversion. I got it used for around that it i feel that was ok. Mark my word. Game will be really inexpensive very quickly .",3.0
