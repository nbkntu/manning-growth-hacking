"I tried this with Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. The wheel is not officially detected in this game or others. It was detected as the older wheel, not the ""speed wheel"". Also a major overlook is no bumper buttons! When I start the game, I have to log into my profile. But I have my Xbox live account protected by a button combination that includes the bumper buttons. Can't enter in password using this device and it locks out the other controller. So I have to disable my combo and then launch the game. Major oversight by Microsoft engineers who designed this piece of junk.

Bumpers also used in this game for nitro and I have to remap everything, since I lose two buttons. Also no look left and right in cockpit view. Microsoft needs to patch all the racing games to work with this device. On that note, it does provide better control of the cars.",3.0
"Well, it seems to be a button masher. Got game really cheap, so i thought i would give it a try since i had heard of game alot, but never played. Positives are it is really pretty simple to play and has some hours a mindless fun. Music is pretty good and i sort of likes the throwback feel. Negatives are, it seems like a game out of the 80's or something. Very simple, combat is pretty bad , weapons generally act the same, extremely repetitive. Compared to demons souls or dark souls not only is combat not even close to as good, nor graphics or complexity nor replayability. Why am i giving this really repetitive old feeling game a decent rating of a 3. Well, it is nice to get away from games that are complex and take forethought. You pretty much just hack and slash. By the way, borderlands is way better than this. I would say get this for around twenty dollars or so and its worth it for a short term diversion. I got it used for around that it i feel that was ok. Mark my word. Game will be really inexpensive very quickly .",3.0
"I bought the hype and the game from PS store.  I downloaded the game and loaded it up.  The game is fun for an arcade racer.  The only problem is I made to the second city and I was bored of the game.  I have not touched the game since my guy had to go to St. Louis.  I might be missing a lot of great action, but at this point it seems repetitive, seems repetitive, seems repetitive, seems repetitive (little joke).  I really wanted to like this game.  I will go back to it when I get sick of the other games I have and hope it brings a little joy to me.  I played the Need for Speed game on PS4 and enjoyed it, but thought that was repetitive, this game beats NFS for receptiveness. I did not play with friends, so maybe that makes a difference and can not comment on making a ""crew"".  If I bought the disc version of this game, I would have sold it by now, but since I downloaded it, I will give it try a little later and maybe a spark will light The Crew fire.",3.0
Great sound & comfortable but after 6 months the microphone just stopped working. I don't know what it is with Turtle Beach but I've had a couple headphones that just quit working after about 6 months of use. I love Turtle Beach headphones sound but it seem the quality/durability is severely lacking.,3.0
"This is a great game, great Graphics and Soundtrack in that medival times in which Templars went to kill and exterminate the greatest empire on earth. also it has a good modern fictional story linked with this controversial religious times. BUT THE GAME IS SO repetitive, from city to city you do exactly the same things. climb a tower, pickpocket, sit on a bench, kill two 5 templars, rescue citizens,collect impossible to find flags, and kill a ""boss"". thats about all in the 4 or 5 cities. So its a good game but it has a short time until gets to be boring",3.0
"Ok dude this one gonna be a crappy review, I usually give crappy reviews when I get crappy games... I played about 2 hours of it, now now just you wait it was enough to get the just of the game. You spend like 15 mins in the city at first which gives a bad start off for the game this is dead space not resident evil 6 lol. Then finally you get to space and it starts to feel like dead space all over again . Well after things pick off it lends more into a lot of chatter and action where you're just shooting enemies after enemies instead of setting the creepy feeling and wild cutscenes. That's where they dropped the ball, it's like they went Hollywood with this game adding the stupid weapon upgrade build your own weapon mess which you really don't know what you're doing other than mixing random stuff together hoping a new weapon will be made while on dead space 2 every 30 mins you had a new weapon then spending more time upgrading the power of it, so yeah the weapon system is poop on here, along with too much shooting but not enough of the scare tactics to go with it. Sadly the game has suffered from going Hollywood so they feel they could change so much about the game people would still love it since dead space 2 sold well but not that much. Anywho this doesn't feel scary like the first two and it doesn't do anything new other than making a painful weapon system that made me take this game back in 5 days to GameStop. A 3 out of 5",3.0
"Not worth the money, since you can just download patches that include more cars and colors (and these cars as well), while no lawsuits actually care, I hear. I bought it anyway, though. I got the game on humble bundle, like most other people who still play this, so I didn't mind going back and spending ten bucks, since the game was on my wish list anyway.",3.0

"This is a great control, the batteries last long (I think even more than 50 hours without vibration) and it works almost perfect. I would have given a 5 star if the X bottom didn't stay pressed down (sometimes) when I am playing. Maybe is the logitech design that the X bottom doesn't work always right. The orignal ps2 control, in the right, the bottoms( square, triangle, circle and x) are on a flat surface and that's why it works great. But this logitech design, the surface is not flat that's why the bottoms don't work as good as the original ps2 control. They should design a better control, but with flat surface for the bottoms to make it as functional as the original ps2 control.",3.0
Bought for my kids; they like it but don't play it a lot,3.0
"Campaign gets 1 star just awful, I can't even tell you what it was about skipped all the cut scenes just to get through the game. On that note the space battles was the only high point to it until you realize that's basically all there is and you just want to shoot enemies (after all it is a FPS) if you're looking for a good story stay clear of this game.
Multi-player is typical COD.
Zombies is the only reason I gave 3 stars much better than black ops 3 zombies but still tiring.
Overall this is not worth the Modern Warfare that comes with it, wait to see if they release it separately.",3.0
I read they were going to use with with metroid prime hunters years ago but I guess the idea was scrapped I got it just because its cheap.,3.0
"My review of Homefront the Revolution for the PS4

Pro

Interesting story - While the story in Homefront the Revolution can come off as being cheesy I really didn't have an issue with it (I like how they show the 2 North Koreans working in a garage which look very similar to the way the late Steve Jobs & Steve Wozniak did). I like these alternate history story from 2003 Freedom Fighter (in which the Russians won the Cold War) to 2014 Wolfenstein The New Order & Amazon Instant Video The Man in the High Castle (in which the Nazi won World War 2 which for me as a Jewish person is very scary indeed) to the 90s sitcoms Sliders.

Long Campaign - From someone who enjoys games with a strong single contents (there is a four player co-op mode) this to me is a plus. The campaign is about (from what Ive heard) 20 hours long but it can be longer if you are willing to take on the side missions like random events, finding radios & weapons stash and side jobs like kill 5 seekers with a shotgun or take out a certain number of KPA soldiers with a molotov cocktail.

FarCry Approach - For those who like the way Ubisoft approaches open world games then youll probably like Homefront the Revolution. Basically you hack some kind os server (very easy to do) and once is done other areas in the map will open up such as bases and other side things to do. Bottom line is if you like that kind of approach in an open world game then youll probably like Homefront the Revolution.

Guerrilla Tactics - I like how Homefront the Revolution encourage you not to go in gun ho (you can but you will get easily kill). instead you have to take a cautious approach like instead trying to go in the front door of a n enemy base you could
A. see if there is a ramp and if there is one you can hop on a motorcycle and ride the ramp into the enemy base or
B. find a backdoor and unlock it and try to take a stealthy approach to it and try to take down the enemy quietly.

Modifying Your Weapons on the Fly - And finally another neat feature I like that they put into Homefront the Revolution is the ability to add & switch attachment to your weapons. For example if you want to add (or detach) a scope to your shotgun or assault rifle all you have to do is push the up button on your PS4 control to bring up what attachment are available, hold the R1 button and move the left analog stick to which scope you want to use and it will be added on to your weapon right away (you don't have to go to your base to add or remove modification to your weapon). Also you do have the ability to craft certain weapons like molotov cocktail or home made bombs (youll need the material to make them since they are scattered all across the game).

Cons

Too similar to FarCry - Although I enjoyed the gameplay in Homefront the Revolution it really doesnt do anythings that hasn't been in other games like the Assassin Creed or FarCry series or even the Watch Dogs game. It doesnt mean its a bad game it just doesnt do any thing new that all.

Lack of Polish - Probably the biggest issue facing Homefront the Revolution. While the game is certainly playable you can definitely see the lack of polish in this game. First off youll need to download the day one patch because the game without it is almost unplayable and while the the patch does fix a lot of the problems there are still some issue such as getting stuck in one place (this happen to me once and I had to restart the game at my last save), ok visuals (a little bit better then The Divisions but that not saying much), a below 30fps ( probably around 25fps), a somewhat long loading screen and finally Ive notices that every time I exit a shop the game pauses for about 5 to 10 second.

Overall - I have mix feeling about Homefront the Revolution. While I definitely like the approach they made to this game. Its lack of polish is what hold it back and I think that a damn shame thought (not to mention the development hell it went through). While I don't think the game is as bad as some reviewers have said its far from a perfect game and that a shame because I do want this game to do well but I have a feeling there a good chance this game will more then likely flop.",3.0
"it really just didn't help at all, the connection was slow i mean terrible slow  the fights online had so much lag it made me angry  i wish i could of wrote something positive but",3.0
"Sacred 2 doesnt immediately impress you when you first start playing it.  There's a general graphical dullness to the giant world you explore.  For example, you won't see lots of glow and lighting effects that one might see in virtually any other console game.  And the controls and menus are complicated at first and you _really_ _really_ need to spend some time learning what everything does in the game. Almost every button has at least 2 different functions.

But then I really started to enjoy what the game has to offer.  The attack controls start to make sense (you point the stick in the direction of the enemy and then choose the type of attack from the buttons).  The graphics are good and quite varied, though it has to be said as a point of comparison, the graphics in a game like Fable 2 blow away anything we'll ever see in Sacred 2.

Some have complained of a low framerate, but so far this has not been a game breaker.  You can tell the developers took some shortcuts to keep the framerate as high as possible.  The camera hugs closer to your character than one might expect.  You can go to a birds eye view or behind the shoulder, but both viewpoints seem too close. I suspect the developers did this in order to keep the framerate up.  It is something that doesnt break the game but you _will_ notice it while playing.  Archers might find it a little annoying that one cannot always see on the screen what they want to shoot at, but then again that's what ""area of effect"" spells are for!

There's some other small gripes too.  I usually don't care about voice acting but whoa is it bad in this game.  I would rather hear the original German but there's no option for that that I can see.  And the game has a lot of jokes in it but they just aren't funny. The quests are standard quests that one would expect and nothing remotely special.  This is where Diablo 2 shows its superiority.  Diablo 2 had some great memorable enemies and quests.
