"This controller is pretty much perfect.  You can get a good grip on it, the buttons are easy to access, and it is easy to get used to.  The only thing that took me a while to ajust to was the Z button.  In the end, you don't need to worry about the controller.  You should be focusing on which games to get instead.  :)",5.0
"Bought this figure simply because it was half the price I could get it for in the store.

If I knew these worked in the package, I would have kept my whole collection in their original packages.

That's what I get for shopping on-line, and stumbling across the store display way too late.

"The product comes with a USB cable and a rechargeable battery. Instead of buying batteries you can use the usb cable to let it charge for 1 hour or so. The bad side would be as your playing a game it's hard to charge it since the cable tends to come off easily. The battery pack is pretty durable haven't had any trouble at all while playing some games. I recommend people who have an xbox 360 controller to buy this product instead of spending money on new batteries since eventually it will run out.

Overall i give it a 8.0
for durability and long life
the negative is that it's hard to charge and play at the same time cause
the wire pops out each time.",5.0
