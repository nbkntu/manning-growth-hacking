"This controller is pretty much perfect.  You can get a good grip on it, the buttons are easy to access, and it is easy to get used to.  The only thing that took me a while to ajust to was the Z button.  In the end, you don't need to worry about the controller.  You should be focusing on which games to get instead.  :)",5.0
"Bought this figure simply because it was half the price I could get it for in the store.

If I knew these worked in the package, I would have kept my whole collection in their original packages.

That's what I get for shopping on-line, and stumbling across the store display way too late.

"The product comes with a USB cable and a rechargeable battery. Instead of buying batteries you can use the usb cable to let it charge for 1 hour or so. The bad side would be as your playing a game it's hard to charge it since the cable tends to come off easily. The battery pack is pretty durable haven't had any trouble at all while playing some games. I recommend people who have an xbox 360 controller to buy this product instead of spending money on new batteries since eventually it will run out.

Overall i give it a 8.0
for durability and long life
the negative is that it's hard to charge and play at the same time cause
the wire pops out each time.",5.0

"I played this game for 10 hours straight today and wow... I am absolutely blown away.

This is my first persona game and I was pretty hesitant about it. I read all the reviews and they said it was top knotch so I went with it.

I usually don't like turn based but WOW. Everything in this game is amazing and the story just hooks you in wanting to play more. My girlfriend watched me play and she said it's a playable anime and an adult Pokmon game haha.

Before this game FF XV, horizon zero dawn, and Nioh  were my main games ( if you haven't played Nioh you should) but this game takes the cake.

Anyways, if this is your first persona game buy it because you will absolutely love it.",5.0
"I got this free from Xbox Live Gold, expecting it to be junk being that it was free but this game is actually a properly nice game as in I'd pay money for it if I had to. It's exactly the sort of game that was missing from Xbox, it kinda reminds me of some Nintendo games I miss.

It's very different though, and I love the fact that you can play different characters, have daily goals to meet, and a giant amount of levels to play.

The flow is very nice too, you'll love all the things you need to figure out. That part never gets boring because they have a lot of different looking areas from bright and green to cave like from moving walls that'll crush you to moving blocks and ropes you need to hang on to!

I really think this game is a classic and I'd highly suggest it to any age group.",5.0
excelent like always!,5.0
"Unlike the Halloween Edition of Eye-Brawl, this fella's in-game aesthetics match the toy.  Not only do you get a festive edition of one of the cooler new Non-Swap characters, his ""Jolly"" hat is added to your hat collection and is actually a very decent piece of headwear for your other characters (stats: 12 speed, 15 armor, +40 hp).  Already owning the normal Bumble Blast, I decided to choose the other set of powers for Jolly Bumble Blast so I could enjoy both of this character's play-styles.

But really, if you're even remotely into Skylanders, this guy is a no-brainer.  Snap him up quick, before he sells out or the Holiday season ends!",5.0

"Here's what I consider the holy grail of gaming headsets:

* Surround sound
* Cloth headrest and earmuffs (not that thin weird material some companies like that looks great and shreds after 2 months)
* Solid construction
* Volume control as part of the headset
* Good sound quality
* Good mic quality
* DOES NOT REST ON MY EARS. Maybe I have big ears but a lot of headsets rest directly on my ears and it's uncomfortable after a while.

This is apparently impossible to find. If you know of any, let me know (but then, you probably wouldn't be shopping for these). I've tried a number of gaming headsets and they all fail pretty much 2 or more of the above. This headset only fails the top one: it's straight stereo. Granted things like the Logitech G35 aren't true surround sound in that they use software to simulate it (it's technical) but I think it's a good improvement over stereo. But all of the surround sound headphones I've tried, including the G35, were of inexcusably bad build quality and just fall apart in one way or another all too soon. I don't know why companies spend so much making a great sounding and feeling headset and then screw it up with thin parts that easily break/disintegrate.

So, so far I'm happy with this purchase. The cloth liner should last longer than that Logitech G35 junk. The build is a mix of plastic and metal but the stress points seem solid. Mic quality is good and the mic pickup is very good -- had to turn it down whereas most headsets make me maximize the mic volume. The ear piece is large, encompasses my ears and doesn't press on them -- no discomfort after a couple hours having them on nonstop. Sound quality is perfect to my ear.

Just note that it's not surround sound and you need functioning mic/audio jacks on your computer (as this is not a USB headset).

I'll update this review if I have any build quality issues but it LOOKS solid enough, in a ""but don't sit on them"" sort of way.",5.0

"I just got this game and after playing for a couple of hours I can say that Need for Speed Series is back on track. I was around for the original Need for Speed and Hot Persuit series, those were so much fun, if they could oly bring those back.

ProStreet and Carbon were complete disasters, extreamly disapointing, I had to stop playing after my first time.... this one is at least 4 times better than the lader.

The graphics are crisp, but many daytime sceens look washed on my HDTV, I thought something was wrog with my TV. lol. But that's how the game is. But that aside, gameplay is designed for super highspeed, the stearing ratio is tight, meaning that if you just tap the controler, you'll hit a wall, but at high speeds, you need that tight streaing ratio. The cops aren;t that dumb like some say, they don't stop chasing you.... I got caught.

Some say the frame rate gets choppy, I have't seen that yet.

Overall gamplay and the fun factor are high.. the game is fast paced, not like the last 2 games that were out. I would say if you a NFS fan, this is the one to get.

EDIT: This game is better than I describe, I haven't been able to stop playing.. The cops caught me many times, and it's true that with the first car it's easy to beat the challenges, but the challenges get harder, where you need to upgrade your car and buy power add on's as well to win.... Frame rate is fine, absolutly no freezing..Great Game, I think the folks bashing this game, don't actually own it!",5.0

"This is a not an add-on to the Minecraft game.  It more like an interactive movie set in the Minecraft universe.  Basically you watch videos, and every few seconds or minutes you will be prompted with a few options for what your character should do or say.  Most of the choices you make are what you say, but sometimes you are asked to choose where to run, which monster to fight, or which of your friends to help.

I sat next to my 7-year-old daughter as she played this.  As we are both big Minecraft fans, it was a very fun experience, and it is certainly more meaningful and the story is more compelling if you've played the game.  She was able to read most of the text herself, but did sometimes need help.  The text is only displayed on the screen for 5-to-10 seconds before you must make a choice or the game will make a choice for you (usually for your character to remain silent).  My only problem with this game is that this was too short of a time for either of us to read everything and make a good choice.  Other choice games I have played that were made by the same company gave you more time.  There are two tricks to this that might help.  The first is that the game usually gives you four options each time: The top option is to say or do nothing, the left option is usually a passive choice (nicely ask for something or support someone), the right option is usually an aggressive choice (demand something or fight), and the bottom option is in between.  The second trick is that it doesn't really matter what you select as all choices either have very short term effects (such as another character becomes momentarily angry with you) or longer term effects that all lead to the same destination.

You can die in the game if you make a wrong move or fail to act, but all that means is that you go back a few seconds to try again.  There were only a very few times that the puzzles or action sequences were difficult enough that I needed to help my 7-year-old daughter.

There are five episodes, each lasting 2-to-3 hours.  I had no problem downloading all of the episodes (there are all currently available).  As each episode is around a gigabyte, you might want to start downloading all of the episodes well before you intend to start playing the game.

Surprisingly, there is some mild swearing in the game, such as ""We got screwed"", ""Crap"", ""Damn"", and even a joke about ""dropping the F-bomb"", that may bother some parents who don't want their kids to hear this.",5.0
"this game is fantastic! extremely realistic. it will rival any game xbox has as far as graphics go. this isn't a fast paced game. you have to take your time & think about your next move. just like chess. not an easy game, even on recruit. but very enjoyable. the charecters move very life like. i have not tried it with the headset, but i'm sure it would be easier with it.",5.0

"I don't plan to turn my review into a referendum on the makeup of the WoW virtual society, as I've seen in many previous reviews. Yes, many player attitudes and play habits have changed since the early days of the game, but that was already happening well before this expansion, and there are many more factors than just game mechanics involved.

So let's talk about the gameplay here:

* I've long thought that WoW has missed the boat in not implementing instanced player housing. I'd love to be able to buy a cottage, or a castle. In Mists of Pandaria, there is a baby step in this direction ... the farm you build. It's fun, and I always pet my dog when I get there and before I leave. It is also a very helpful way to get materials for all your professions without grinding or spending tons of gold in the AH.

* Daily quests are taken to the limit in MoP, and I like very much what they've done with them. Each area with daily quests has a wide assortment of potential quests, from which you get a subset each day. So you have ""easy days"", and ""groan days"". :-) And at 20 gold a pop, you can accumulate some serious cash in a hurry. When my Paladin hit 90 and paid for flying in Pandaria, he was down to 1800 gold. Just over a week later ... and only from doing daily quests ... no AH sales ... he was up to 7800 gold.

* Why do you need all that gold? Well, outside of buying gear in the AH, there are a lot of mounts you can purchase with exalted reputations, and they cost a good bit of cash. The reputation grinds are made easier because at Revered, you can buy a writ from each faction that doubles your future reputation gains with that faction ... account wide! And those writs only cost about 42 gold.

* Vanity pets and mounts are now account wide, so you don't have to buy or rep grind with every character to ride certain mounts. Some mounts do still require a character to rep grind, like the Cloud Serpents. However, with the rep writ, that really only takes a few days of dailies.

* For miners, the new continent is a bonanza of ore. It's everywhere. It isn't uncommon for me to do one set of dailies and have two stacks of ore just from opportunity swoops ... no special trips out grinding it at all ... a time sink that was a serious pain in many previous levels of the game.

* Most parts of the new map are literally gorgeous, and often make me want to stop at a scenic overlook and just admire the vista ... similar to the old look down on Dalaran's force field when it was still north of Southshore. There are remarkable numbers of little details that are entertaining and fascinating ... such as the pool on the south coast where two panda children are throwing snacks to a giant goldfish, which ""pounces"" on each morsel as it hits the water. LOL

* The ""easy join instances"" and raids got me doing that again. Some have complained about the effect this has had on some large raiding guilds. I can tell you that I don't miss waiting around for an hour at raid time to find out if I ""made the cut"" for that week's raid, or pocket Napoleon raid leaders cussing out anyone who accidentally hit the wrong key. I did PLENTY of big time raiding, including a spell as Guildmaster of a decent raiding guild, and I'm just fine with the LFRs. I can log in, join the queue, and inside of 15 minutes I'm in a raid. No, it has nothing like the comradeship of my old raiding guilds, but it doesn't waste my entire evening trying to get one raid accomplished either. I DO have a life outside of the WoW world. LOL And I have real friends in the real world too. If I make them in WoW, fine. If I don't, just as fine. I run instances FAR, FAR more than I ever could before, and am much less frustrated in the time leading up to a raid.

* The Cross Zone stuff? I'm up in the air about that. You often ""see"" things while on a taxi that just aren't there after you land ... especially frustrating to a hunter who thinks he has a lead on a rare pet. LOL Other times, it is a help, as more players in an area keep the monster population to a manageable density.

* Unfortunately, this expansion does keep the game on its long, long slide to ""hit the easy button to win"". Mages and warlocks literally CAN NOT run out of mana anymore, but strangely hunters and monks frequently run low on energy. Mounts are available at low levels and for a pittance compared to what they cost when I started the game at launch (and I had played various levels of the pre-release beta too). Travel is much easier. Experience point levels have been lowered to the point where you can easily level characters just by doing the daily cooking and fishing quests in Stormwind and Dalaran. LOL

However, overall the changes have made the game much more accessible and much less frustrating for the casual player ... that is, people who have important things to do in the ""real world"" ... like work, household maintenance, and interacting with their families! LOL I can log into the game now, spend 45 minutes waiting for and participating in a raid, maybe get a nice gear upgrade (maybe not), then be done and get back to life. In the ""good old days"" it could take much of that time just to travel to where you needed to be, without ever actually starting to do anything ""productive"".

I'd given up the game for almost three years because I just didn't have the time or the patience anymore to do all the ""waiting"" the game required before you got to something you felt could enhance your character. It is much improved in that regard, and thus has my business again ... at least for a while.

If you're an ex-WoW'er, you should give it a try, especially now that it has been out long enough for the expansion price to be discounted.",5.0

"Lets start off with how I never buy products unless it is a Razor. I am an advent gamer, coder, also a college student so my life is on a computer. I have all razor products from keyboard, mouse, headset, Orbweaver (left hand keypad), to even the headset stand and mouse pads. Due to some tough times money became a struggle and my keyboard and mouse needed replaced. (mind you my mouse broke 3 times from razor and i am NOT rough on my computer at all.) So I started shopping and price checking. Would cost me over 200 dollars for a mouse and keyboard from Razor. I decided to try an off-brand. Saw this one and said to myself ""the cost inst too bad"" so I tried it. Mind you I am very picky on my computer products. This mouse came and I tried it and loved it. The feeling was great in your hands, the buttons on the side feel very solid. The mouse does have a driver but its just to change colors and map the keys. Below the scroll bar has arrows to change the sensitivity of the mouse which I LOVE! When I play overwatch or other games, turning it up is simple and when I want it slower for web browsing and homework, I can simply turn it down. It also has weights in it (in case it feels too heavy) but I never took them out. Didn't seem to need too. Been using this mouse for about 3 months and It still feels brand new. (My old razor one's scroll bar and top buttons (not clickers) would give out after 3 months). I am on a computer alot so that might be way the old mouses gave out but for a gaming company on products vs this company...UtechSmart is way better in my opinion. I won't ever waste precious money on a high-dollar company when their is companies like these guys who have way better pro\ducts.

Also to those who wonder, the keyboard I got is Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Blue Switch. And like I reviewed before, this keyboard is better than all the others Ive had. So take my word for it, this mouse is deff the way to go for all gamer. Not just ones on a budget but just in general. I spend 10+ hours a day with college, games, and coding. This is high recommended.

Just wish they sent me a company sticker so I can represent it to all my gamer/coding friends.",5.0

"Having enjoyed the first 2 games in the Assassin's Creed series, I was interested in seeing what new game play Black Flag brought to the table. The first 2 games, although very fun, suffered from a lack of variety in the smaller side missions. (Follow this person, steal this wallet, eaves drop on conversations, rinse and repeat) The stories were always compelling, but the game play lacked some variety. What both were very good at was eventually, after ranking up, making you feel like the baddest man in town. The combat system was engaging and fun to master.

This latest game in the series suffers from some of the same issues of game play when your character is on land. The mechanics of the missions are still lacking some variety. Still, Ubisoft has made the land elements a little more epic and complex, so improvements have been made. Especially fun are the raids on the fortified warehouses. They involve stealth and outright combat and can be truly challenging.

Once Edward Kenway grabs the Jackdaw and hits the ocean, this game really shines. You start with the bare minimum of armor and offensive weapons and then gradually build your capabilities until your ship is also the baddest vessel on the water. The whale hunting, naval combat, legendary ship battles, storms and fort assaults can be played repeatedly. I cannot stress how addictive this part of the game can become. It is truly brilliant open world game design.

The online multi-player section of this game tried for big things with the cooperative and PVP play. It is unlike any multi-player game I have ever played. Although they provide tutorials on how to score well, most people just run around like maniacs. The online gameplay is so nuanced that I think it was lost on most people used to shooting everything that moves. I stuck with it just to get the Platinum trophy for the game.
