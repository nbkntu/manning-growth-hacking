"The game is great, 5 stars, but anyone paying $350-$400+ dollars for the Wizard's Edition is insane.  The only thing that is really nice to have while playing the game is the hardcover version of the Wizard's Companion.  But is that really worth an extra $300+ dollars!!!  Especially when you can download a pdf of the complete English Wizard's Guide for free, and then bring it to Kinko's and have them spiral bind it for $20.

As for the cute doll and artwork, understand this is not a collectable that will go up in value, a year from now you will be able to buy a Wizard's Edition for under $100.  So for now buy the regular game and either live with using the in game Wizard's Companion or get the pdf for free and view it on a tablet while playing or print it out for now (heck, an online binding service will make a hardcover version for you for less then $100) and then buy the full Wizard's Edition a year from now for a normal price.",1.0,0.6666666666666666,positive,negative
"We had this on pre-order for 2 years. Forza 5 was already out. Since then Forza 6 an 7 came out. What we got was nice visuals,and massive chaos in racing achievements in you as driver versus game challenges. Game is structured around expensive steering wheel controllers. When doing the challenges the car is controlled by the game to a release point. When the car is released so you can now control it,the car is pointed in a negative direction that cost you time in correcting,the screen is full of graphics that block your view of the track,and your supposed to beat a perfect challenge in a time based win time of bronze,silver,and gold. Only after much time with the PS4 controller will you finally achieve a gold. Most of all achievements are earned this way. ""NOT"" much racing happening. Your rank earns what tracks you race on. The game can't tell what cars you already have,so expect to get very dissatisfied with many repeats of awarded cars. Even pre-ordering bonus cars,are duplicated by regular(as if you didn't pre-order) cars. Forza never duplicates any cars in your garage! I know people who have 6 of the same car awarded by game play in their garage! The lack of intelligent programing is so obvious it will disappoint you. This is not Gran Turismo from PS3 or even PS2. Sony was all about shafting it's race car group of players!",1.0,0.13888888888888887,neutral,negative

However, this game is frustrating because it has no pop up/pull down or whatever you want to call it, map. No map! Just the radar circle thing at the bottom of the screen.

"I am a real big fan of all the Soulcalibur games until Soulcalibur ledgens was introduced. first of all let me make one thing clear this is the worst Soulcalibur game ever, if you are planning on buying this game please don't pleassssssssssssse don't. Don't be a victim like me who fell into that trap, because of the game name title soulcalibur I went and buy the game; that was the worst choise I ever made in my entire life. I think that soulcalibur should stay the way it once was as an head to head fighting game. I hope that this review some how reach Namco/Bandi message board, so these game develpers can see what crazy mistakes they have made. All other soulcalibur are great but i can't say the same for Soulcalibur ledgens. Oh yeah let me talk about the wii nunchuck & remote, it's a good innovation but not for a game like soulcalibur, what were the developers thinking; the Nintendo wii has a classic controler which would have work well with the versus mode. This game need to be taken off the shelves for further modifications. Namco/Bandi please keep fighting games where they belong and Adventure games where they belong, I think that this was a bad step for you. I know all the fans of soulcalibur would agree with me, and for all who were having thoughts about buying this",1.0,-0.03333333333333335,neutral,negative
"Was good for a week, then the home button malfunctions. Controller still works but when I plug it in I am asked if I want to shut down and when I turn the system off it turns back on.

"How completely stupid. You can't choose which user to install games for and they don't really get ""installed"" because you have to keep the loader on your system or the CD in the drive. I tried installing many of the games (yes you have to choose one at a time and you get no idea of what the game is about until you install and launch it) only to find when I took the disk out of my drive and removed the shell application from my desktop that nothing was actually resident on my hard drive! What a waste of money, no matter how fun the games might be. Better to download them individually from game sites-- costs more initially but you actually get something useful for your money.",1.0,-0.2,neutral,negative
"Don't be fooled.  This game is simply a collection of past horror games.  EA thinks they made an original title when all they did was take pieces of different sci-fi/horror games from the past and put them all together into this title.  Doom 3 + Half Life 2 + Zerglings from Starcraft = Dead Space.

But if you don't really care about that or the fact that this game is more rent-ware from EA just like Spore or Crysis Warhead, enforced by the not-uninstallable and hated SecuROM software that limits the number of installs you can perform by phoning home to EA to irreversibly use up an activation, all to ""protect you from yourself"" then go ahead and buy this game.",1.0,-0.4,negative,negative

"I am not one to put a huge review so you will have to wait for those. I will just add some things I am thinking.

Glitchy Glitchy so much so that talking is garbled mixed in with someone else talking. So much so that an NPC ears pop out of his hood then go back in just to come back out again. Everyone walks like they have a stick up their behind.
The talking, when it does happen correctly does not flow.

AND the writing, I had to get up from my chair and stick my face to the screen to even read it. The combat is horrible because it is so far away that I am kinda guessing what I am doing. The graphics are horrible, nothing like the trailers...but, I am coming off from playing Destiny so my eyes might just be in shock that it looks like the took dragon age 2 and painted over the NPCs. I couldn't tell you about the story because I couldn't get passed all of this to even get to the meat of the story. I think I would rather watch the trailers then actually play the game. Hugely disappointed beyond words. I waited 4 years for this.

Btw, I have a 47"" tv. I feel sorry for you that have a smaller one. You will just have to guess what it is saying or wait until Cassandra is talking and poof, she just disappears and the camera is watching a tree that was behind her. I am not normally a huge graphics person per say but dang, at least have the game work enough for me to get to the story then maybe I can suffer everything else. And another thing, I will never understand why Bioware takes our favorites like Morrigan and does not put them in the game as a party member. Varric? I dunno maybe some like him. Bioware had a winner with Origins and then took the recipe and MESSED IT UP. Just garbage since.

I watched some gameplay on youtube for xbox one. It was much better. If the game does not play well on older gen then it should not be released for it. I wasted $70 and could have put that towards a new gen platform that actually plays the game as it was indented.

Update: I bought an Xbox One...game plays 100% better...do not buy this for the 360 unless you want to deal with glitches and terrible everything",1.0,-0.14814814814814814,neutral,negative
"Let's face it. Nintendo only made one good system. That was the Game Boy Advance Sp. I have to admit that the graphics on this are pretty good especially on Nintendogs. But the Psp has better graphics and better games too. Also, the Psp can do more than the Ds. I see on point in the touch screen. You have to be in the same room as the other person for the pictochat to work. And even if you didn't, talking on the phone is much better. Well, Psp rocks!

"It's amazing to me how ACCLAIM can make a game like Warzone on the N64 and PS1 and make it a decent wrestling game. The only thing some people complained about was the controls being that of a Mortal Kombat style game, which they ignored and kept anyway when they release the games follow up of WWF Attitude. That game looked so promising and the graphics looked awesome, but once the previews where over the the released game was playable, it was possibly the biggest let down of wrestling fan gamers lives. They then lost the rights to the WWE franchise and picked up ECW, in which they pretty much did not update a thing, they just made the ECW arena and wrestlers and added a barbwire match, and that was it. It's a no wonder ACCLAIM are not legendary amongst wrestling games. So here they are, some years after their WWF and ECW release, and a promising new game excited fans called Wrestling Legends. It's gonna feature Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart, the Road Warriors and so many huge name legends... but what do we get? It's a revamped version of Attitude/ECW! Just with some graphical enhancements, and worse controls!

I swear to you, if you have played Attitude, you will see how simmilar this game is in graphics and maneuverability. Everyone hated that your player wouldn't lock onto his target and start punching the air... well, here it is back again! This game may as well be called ACCLAMES ATTITDUE REVIVAL because it seems they are using the same pathetic coding they where using all those years back. I really don't get how other companies manage to make controls basic and smooth, but ACCLAIM always seem to stuff it up in just about every way possible. Moving around and connecting with hits have such bad targeting in this game, and moves, man, why is there so little amount of moves you can have with a wrestler? Seriously, you have about 10 to choose from in each match, and they decided to put an ""excitement"" meter in the game where the crowed react to seeing new moves you haven't done yet, and it drops when you repeat moves... ACCLAIM, why didn't you just give people the choice to be able to actually do a lot of moves, instead of use the same old c@ppy programming you used for ATTITUDE where you kept doing the same moves over and over again because others where useless or got blocked all the time, and you expect people to be forgiving and not notice that all you did was reduced the move abilities and added a meter to say, ""hey, try doing a different move that the controller is too stiff on to be able to execute""

Ah Acclame, you haven't done it again.

I don't particularly ever want to turn this game on ever again. So I can't tell you how many matches there are, or what options you can do, because after 5 matches fighting the same guys in career mode, and winning the belt, I still was going back and forth between Texas and somewhere else doing ugly looking shows against the Von Eric family all the time... which I learned my lesson with previous ACCLAIM wrestling games to not bother finishing it, as ACCLAIM have no imagination when it comes to these sort of things, and you just do the same thing over and over a million times until you are presented with something boring like unlocking 1 wrestler, and having to do it over and over again with other wrestlers just to unlock them all... no thanks ACCLAME, not doing that ever again to be rewarded with nothing in the end, especially when it's so boring after an hours play, and you expect people to play it for days to weeks doing the same no variety matches?

WRONG WRONG WRONG, its like  they took a crappy model of wow and a crappy kotor replica with new paint and scotch taped it together! i bought the advanced game 79.99 the security key and the 60 day play card all that was cuz it was star wars and even they gave you crappy bonus save the lil scooter and training droid. it takes for ever to patch 20-30 gigs of content and everything is unbalanced the jedi story sucks which i was like wtf, yeah sith is fun killing stuff but its a boring story line while the jedi was supposed to be crazy suspenseful and with twists and a natural edge on the sith. the graphics are not even realistic theres barley and character customization like pwi etc.. and they all look the same and korriban looks really wack and its just all unbalanced moves characters and the companions look all the same for the same class and just all that money they ask for its not even worth half of it. Yes it just came out and ik it has glitches and bugs that will be fixed but im not even counting that the only way this game will survive is to scrap the whole engiune and model and thats not happening ur basically getting a crappy kotor and mmo with just voice acting.

"It's so sad because this is really a great game with so much fun for multi-generational play. Unfortunately you can't play much of the game without throwing more and more money in to it.  What an obvious and pathetic money grab from Activision!  All of the game is right there on the disc yet if you want to actually play it you must buy figure after figure which are at least $10 a pop an higher.  Also, even though the little USB portal has a certain little cool factor it gets REALLY annoying having to change characters all the time to play certain phases of the game.  Plus, what's going to happen when that little portal ceases to function or the figures no longer register with the portal?  The game will be useless!  But I don't see why Activision felt the need to come up with such a convoluted system.  Oh yeah, money, that's why.  There are also bugs in the program.  If you get to a certain level and talk to a certain character then you must start all over at square one.  Also trying to coordinate the Wii controllers with the characters is very much a juggling act.  There is no simple way to assign a controller to a character so frequently family members are having to switch around controllers and getting tangled up in the nunchuck wires.  This game is kind of a great idea that turned in to a hot mess.  I say if you have $600 to spend to fully enjoy the game then go for it. The base kit cost is just the beginning.  Otherwise you're going to feel the squeeze from your kids and Activision to get any enjoyment out of the game.  To be clear, the starter kit is HIGHLY inadequate to enjoy the game. You will be spending MUCH more money in the end.  Shame on you Activision and this will be the last game we buy from you.",1.0,-0.05000000000000001,neutral,negative
"-----My opinions----

I started playing the 2k series at 2011 but its was 2k12 that got me hook to this game. I just bought the game 2k13 at gamestop for $65 including tax( what a rip off, $60 for a game is overpriced and the tax literally heighten my anger) and I just want to return it asap. I feel my money is getting wasted. In nba 2k12 I reached all star lvl not to say im a pro but i play this game often. Im just expressing my views of the game no offense to anyone, Im a casual gamer and I hope this will help those who are debating about the game make a decision.

My list of pros and cons for 2k13:

Pros:
1) somewhat better graphic,thru i really didn't notice any major improvement or difference
2)Update roster (kind of the only reason I buy)
3)online play is more stable now

cons:

1)Minor control changes here and there (the ally hoop button change to a bad spot,sub,view,etc)
2)Notice the gameplay is not as fluid or rapid as 2k12 (idk if its just me or what i notice the players run really slow compare to 2k12?)
3)Too many Jayz ( don't get me wrong I love his songs but I don't want to only listen to one artist for the whole time I will be playing this game)
4)Last years covers is way better than this years (Im cool with d rose and durant, but BLAKE GRIFFEN? He is the most overratted dunk champion of all time and literally have no skills besides dunking) (FYI: LAST YEAR IS WAS JORDAN MAGIC AND BIRD....3 )
5)Too many decorations, not as real as the last one.
6)Shots selections are weird, felt like 2k make this game very complicated now (certain buttons activates certain more,etc)
7)SINCE I DIDN'T ""PREORDER"" THIS GAME IM NOT ENTITLE TO ALL STAR BONUS ETC,WHICH IS COMPLETELY BULLS BECAUSE I PAY FULL RETAIL FOR A BRAND NEW GAME AND IM STILL NOT ENJOYING THE WHOLE GAME.

CONCLUSION: If you want to buy this game I strongly suggest you go try this game at your local game store first before buying it. Be prepare to not have the all star bonus stuffs even thru you pay good money. Your best bet will be to wait till this game's price drop, its almost holiday season. This game will go on sale.",1.0,-0.21923076923076926,negative,negative
"Capcom is all about milking the franchise, so it's no surprise that SUPER Street Fighter IV is launching 13 months after SF IV. A few ""new"" characters, lots of tweaking, and rock bottom low price to get you to buying this weak update. If they needed to tweak:

 - The impressive new roster includes classic combatants from previous Street Fighter games like T. Hawk as well as all-new characters such as the mysterious and deadly female fighter, Juri.

- Super Street Fighter IV adds new Ultra Combos and advancements to the state of the art online matchmaking and online game play introduced in Street Fighter IV with numerous additional features

 - Super Street Fighter IV takes many of the groundbreaking features introduced in Street Fighter IV and refines everything to deliver the ultimate vision of Street Fighter to fans the world over.

"I picked up this game months after release, and I'm frustrated to say that it's still completely broken.

I've started the game 8 times, each time with different characters, before/after restarting the console,.. I've tried everything.  It crashes at the end of the first chapter (aka, when you're supposed to start the game), and when you log back in, all of your items are gone and end up in an empty world.  So, then you start over, recreate your character, do the whole tutorial missions over, and then it'll crash again at the end of the chapter.  Rinse / Repeat.  I just wasted hours of my time attempting to play this game with a friend-- it was broken for BOTH of us, in different homes, on different systems.

It's a known bug on their forums, and it's shameful that the game still doesn't work this long after release.  For the first time ever, I'm going to attempt to get a refund on the game simply because it doesn't work.

"Blizzard used to be such a great company. Things have changed. They don't really care about customer input. Some will agree with me, some will not. Here are my reasons why I won't be buying this or possible future blizzard titles.

Diablo 3 requires a constant internet connection at all times. Drop your connection, drop your game, start from your last save. Blizzard claims that they want their online auction house to work so they have to require online. From what I remember of D2 you had to have separate characters for online and offline. This would a great idea for D3 because they would still do their silly auction house, where people will get ripped off by the ones and zeros that Blizzard puts out for people who want to pay out more. They're going to turn it into a ""pay to win"" style game.

Online always means no mods. The only way you'll ever get mods for this game is if you get a pirated version of this game. It's pretty sad. Games like the elder scrolls had amazing mods and didn't have the hilariously stupid drm.

NO LAN. again I'm going to say it. NO LAN. you'll have to have excellent internet for you want your buddies to be able to play together. I like to be able to banter with my friends in the same room. Not all of us have or want to pay for fast internet. It's so sad to see developers stop support for LAN

Blizzard merged with Activision. They don't care about customer input. They're pretty arrogant of their prices. They're still trying to sell the original Starcraft for $20. IT CAME OUT IN 1996! Let it drop. All their other game keep their prices as well. In my opinion Valve has a lot better thing going for them. They'll release a game and keep the price high during it's prime marketable time and then they bring in to a reasonable price. Blizzard doesn't listen. They deserve 0 stars if I could give it to them. I like the old blizzard back in the day when they cared about customers.",1.0,0.26262626262626265,positive,negative
I did three betas for this game and as a long time mmo player and beta tester i can only say that this game is a insult to the genre. It is dumbed down garbage and contributes nothing to online gaming. Its a massive step backwards for mmos. 15 dollars a month? Yeah right. This steaming pile will be free to play by the end of 2014. And not in a succesful way like say rift is. My only hopes for mmos now are star citizen or everquest. Game producers need to actually start giving us our moneys worth. A 2000 computer can do so much more than these pathetic games they are continually rolling out. Pc gaming is supposed to be high and gaming.

"First of all, yes I'm aware of the minimum system requirements, I'm running an Intel i5 3.3 ghz, on Windows 7 64bit, 8gb of ram, EVGA Nvidia Geforce 570 GTX with all new drivers installed and verified, including a bios update. I've contacted Ubisoft to troubleshoot and they've verified my system should be running the game fine. System temperatures are running within the normal operating ranges (verified with Everest, as well as Speccy). I also have a Corsair H80 GPU Liquid Cooler. I'm running on the lowest graphics settings, although I shouldn't have to, since my build runs Tera, Skyrim, BF3, all at the highest resolution.

The problem is, every 5-10 minutes, the game (after running smoothly without a hitch for those 5-10 minutes), crashes unexpectedly and inexplicably to the desktop. I can still hear the background voices and sounds of the Boston streets, but the program just stops responding and I have to Ctl+Alt+Del and end the program.

I bought the darn thing on PS3 just to play the game, and am pursuing a refund on the PC version. I've been on the Ubisoft forums, and there are a few who experienced the same issues. I'll install on a 32 bit windows system later on and see if I have the same problems. Really disappointed since I was looking forward to the game and it seems like it'd be fun.

I paid under $5 and I feel ripped off. The game is slow! Graphics are outdated. Overall it's just boring! The most fun I had while playing the game for all of 10 minutes was renaming my villagers stupid names.,1.0,-0.6,negative,negative
"I had finished Ratchet Deadlocked and okay maybe not the best but still, its got some intersting stuff to it, but this? No. Abso-!@#$%^&-lutely not. The disappointment here cannot be described. The game had too few weapons, some were useless, and the game was just awful. Nothing good came from this game. Nothing. This game looked like someone was just not committed to the R&C name. This is what happens when someone who is NOT the original creator makes a new game in a beloved series without knowing what they are getting into. This and Secret Agent Clank are both total failures. 1/10 and it gets the 1 only because this is not an original console title as it was on the PSP first. Still you expect something good with Ratchet and Clank on the cover. NOT THIS TIME!",1.0,-0.2857142857142857,negative,negative
"This game was 10 years in the making and what a disappointment. We are a year after release and the game is still a disappointment.

Pro's:
Pretty much none, if you really had to reach for one I guess you could say the graphics were ok.

Con's:
- Little content on release
- No depth to the game or characters
- No character customization
- Still can't even dye legendary or set items
- Very limited stash
- A year later and they have only added minor updates like monster power, paragon levels, brawling
- They released an article showing ""how much work they have done"" on diablo over the past year, and had so little work to show for it that they had to include the PTR data and multiple versions of each release they did to make it look like there was far more content added than there really was.
- game economy is in the trash, gold is worthless once again.
- Constant glitches, hacks, and gold spammers again
- last round of glitches allowed billions of gold to be duped by players (not the first time, and certainly not going to be the last).
- Game is still unstable crashing on occasion and lagging for many people still. Once again the game crashed on my Hardcore monk without a single mob around and yet he somehow still dies.
- Customer support is a joke, Blizzard has proven time and time again that they could care less about customer satisfaction. Any time they have issues they simply take down the boards and all support lines so people can't publicly complain. I guess if they can pretend they don't see it they can pretend it doesn't exist.
- Crafting once again is nearly worthless.
- Items are worthless, I have level 60's of every char and have played hundreds of hours and found hundreds of legendaries and yet the best item I have found was mediocre at best. Almost everything you pick up off the ground is nearly worthless.

There are so many issues with this game it's a joke. This should have been a major title for Blizzard and they not only dropped the ball, but they popped it and set it on fire. This is the last straw for me. I refuse to purchase any future Blizzard games as they have proven without a doubt that they simply don't care about their customer base. Don't waste your money on this game and for gods sake don't waste any money on the real money auction house. Show them that you demand better quality games by hitting them in the wallet where it hurts since money is the only thing they care about.",1.0,-0.4842105263157896,negative,negative
"Some people are giving this game good reviews. I can only say that they must be five or have never played a video game before. This game has an interesting idea, but fails to execute. It is boring the story is stupid and the graphics are sub par. This game is perhaps worth [...] not too much more. On a positive note the trophies are really easy. Pause the game and get a trophy. I am embarassed to have this game in my collection. Stay away at all cost this game is a hazzard.",1.0,0.3333333333333333,positive,negative

"I know this collection is a bargain price, but there is just one major problem. That is the difficulty. The games are by nature difficult, but you pretty much have endless continues. It's kind of like Mario Brothers in that once you used the warp zones and stepped on the turtles you could easily beat the game. The only difference here is you can continue anywhere and you are not running out of quarters.

Another thing that is missing is strategy. These are all action games that the enemies and obstacles are in a pattern. Once you very tediously mastered the pattern you win. But you will not have to master the pattern because you can just continue.

The only games that are worth playing are the Street Fighter series. At least there is strategy behind your moves and combos. And though you have endless continues you still have to win the fight.

I recommend you don't buy this series and leave retro games to roms. I'm an older gamer and while I grew up playing games like this series and have no clue why I thought it was fun. The are some classics that are good like the original Zelda, Pac Man, Mario Brothers. I just prefer a modern shooter, role playing, strategy, or simulation.  The elements behind these action games have already been exhausted and its time to play modern games.",1.0,0.1176470588235294,neutral,negative
"I love mini golf so when I saw this I had to check it out.  I am very glad I rented it first and didn't just blind-buy it because we played 6 holes and turned it off, never to play it again.  The most fun was picking out your outfit so that says a lot.  The controls just don't work (especially your swing strength) and the holes aren't fun.  I like seeing where the hole is and putting to get the ball in...that is mini golf.  This had too many antics and obstacles and was more frustrating than fun.  Big disappointment, but not as much as if I had bought the game first.",1.0,0.2857142857142857,positive,negative
"Disgraceful game to sonic's title the speed of light he's supposed to be fast not slow if anyone wants an excuse to like Sonic the Hedgehog 06 this is it this game ruined it all. I'm not even gonna bother touching this game as a true Sonic fan I'm gonna wait for Sonic Boom Fire & Ice because they're supposed to bring his speed back in it. If you've played Sonic games over the ages you would see why many people are complaining about the nerfing of his speed and combat system. Apparently Sonic Team thought it would be better to nerf the speed because of modern kids and they think kids are stupid but they're not.

If money satisfies anyone they need to do a better job at the storyline development and bring back the older Sonic the Hedgehog if they want to attract real paying customers. You gotta remember games are also about the business of the company not that I'm saying they don't care but they need money to succeed in there operation to satisfy the gamers. For one they still have not made a Silver the Hedgehog game even though they made one with Shadow the Hedgehog that would bring in good money to the company if they did a game like that I would surely play it. If you are looking for a sonic game to avoid please avoid this one at all costs you're gonna regret it!",1.0,-0.5,negative,negative
This game sucks just like project car.  What ever happened to making simulated racing games like Gran Turismo and Forza Motor Sports Racing games rather then making disappointing arcade simulated racing games such as this game without upgrades for the cars and hard to understand tuning on all cars.  Plus The race line in this game sucks I have never seen a race line that never changes colours until this game and due to that I got rid of this game and got Gran Turismo 6 on a trade in at Game Stop today.,1.0,-0.4444444444444444,negative,negative
"If you want a lot of headaches then buy this game outright. If you want to be smart about it download and try the demo first. Different people like different things, so you may love this game or hate it, gameplay-wise. What is not in dispute though is that the game is definitely buggy. That point has come through in review after review, so do you're self a favor and install and play the demo first. I expect we'll see a patch and a re-release of the demo in the near future, due to these issues. But testing your system out with the free demo will give you the ""heads-up"" as to whether or not the game will be stable enough with your drivers/system specifications.",1.0,-7.930164461608259e-18,neutral,negative

"If you liked the first STALKER you will love the sequel....BUT......

It is just like the first time. The game is LOADED with bugs that cause crashes, you cannot travel to new areas, you cannot travel back to old areas. In some cases you are PERMANENTLY stuck!!!!

I am referring to patch 1.5.04...the latest as of today. You could play, stop when you do all you can do when a lethal bug hits you and wait for another patch...but the next patch might kill your old saved games. This happened with the 1st STALKER.

RIGHT NOW -
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! Obviously GSC and THQ learned nothing from the first mess they created and have given you another load of headaches, bugs, crashes and poor framerates to deal with.

Wait for at least another patch or two and read some gaming forums to check out how frustrated everyone is right now!!

That includes me. I stupidly thought it would be different this time but it is just as bad if not worse!

The game will be great and will be worth buying/playing ONCE and ONLY AFTER the bugs and MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE FIXED!

The game makers should try better to reach as many customers as possible giving more choises of gameplay.

Second game for the ps4 and still unable to play online with one of your friends TOGETHER. You are forced to find 6 people (no less) or play against your friend.
