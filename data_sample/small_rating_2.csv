"I owned this game for a total of one day before I couldn't handle it anymore and traded it in for something else. This is a game that sounds like a good concept, but the end result is short of flat. It does have some neat little quirks to it though. I like the body tool and the way you can customize the sim with jewelry, tattoes, and a decent assortment of clothes. The pets can also be customized and the feature is pretty fun to play with. I had a blast designing the SIMS and their pets... but unfortunately, the game is more that that.

The actual game play was a little hard to manage and it was a little disapointing that the pets are not playable. Of course, this being a play sation version, the graphics aren't incedible but they aren't bad either. Just trying to figure out how the game works and getting a feel for the content was a bit time consuming for me and since my free time is limited, this really isn't the game for me. I love the SIMS series... but this one seems a little weak.
