"I owned this game for a total of one day before I couldn't handle it anymore and traded it in for something else. This is a game that sounds like a good concept, but the end result is short of flat. It does have some neat little quirks to it though. I like the body tool and the way you can customize the sim with jewelry, tattoes, and a decent assortment of clothes. The pets can also be customized and the feature is pretty fun to play with. I had a blast designing the SIMS and their pets... but unfortunately, the game is more that that.

The actual game play was a little hard to manage and it was a little disapointing that the pets are not playable. Of course, this being a play sation version, the graphics aren't incedible but they aren't bad either. Just trying to figure out how the game works and getting a feel for the content was a bit time consuming for me and since my free time is limited, this really isn't the game for me. I love the SIMS series... but this one seems a little weak.

As I said... this is a ""concept"" game... one that sounds good and looks appealing on paper but in the end, it can be more of a chore than a dip into fun times.",2.0
"The fun part about this game is beating up the driver. The negative part of this game is the controls are impossible. You'll make your guy go left and you'll take a super sharp turn right into the wall and then you'll crack up because all the people behind you will just run over your character as if they don't give a crap that he's dying.  Another thing I don't like is the music, it's people screaming their heads off for no apparent reason. You can't even understand them.",2.0
"Grapple is a joke to use.  Half the game is based on playing on the stupid train.  It's very short, it's very very very very repetitive.  Don't buy it.",2.0
"It was a little better than the other two, but was as repetitive as the other two. It pre-ordered the game, it was not worth the 60 bucks I spent on it.",2.0
"Basically, It's one mission in an episodic storyline. It took me about an hour and a half to finish it without collecting all the patches hidden around. Then, they made 6 spinoff missions using variations of the exact same map with weak premises. So, it's a 10-minute video, a 1-3 hour gameplay experience, and some side mission spinoffs.

Everything said, I played the whole thing in under 3 hours and traded it off.",2.0
"i got this game for christmas one year. I played it and it was really fun...... for about three monthes. After i made a great house, met all the people, finished my work, and picked up over 1000 oranges it got BORING.

After i played this game for around two weeks i met a mole that was awfully rude and cruel. He called me a slacker and looser, plus he wouldent let me type the stuff he was telling me too.

The people (animals) in the game are very annoying too. They all say the same thing over and over and over again until you want to bash your head into a cement wall.

another problem is the mortgages, they shoot up to a great height. Its a GAME. and kids that are six don't know what a mortgage is, they barely know the value of money.

another problem is the people who judge your house, half the time its just ""your house is a wreck."" the other half its ""you can do better.""

and heres another problem, you know how i said the game was fun for three monthes? well two of those monthes were during summer vacation, i could have been playing outside but i was inside playing this dumb game

"The Biggest Loser is my favorite TV show, and Jillian Michaels is my favorite part of the show.  I was prepared to love this game no matter what.

I've had my Wii Fit since it first came out, but I've definitely falling into a rut and needed something new.

Pros
1. There is a nice variety of games.
2. It's great that it can calculate your calories burned.
3. Using the Wii Fit Board is optional.
4. I definitely broke a sweat (thanks to all the running)
5. There are clear instructions before each activity.

Cons
1. Too much running - I'd rather use a treadmill.
2. Without my entering my weight, I'm skeptical about how accurate the calorie count was.
3. I carefully followed the directions on several games, but had the same no response that other's have mentioned. I *know* I was doing it correctly.
4. There aren't many spaces available for the tips you unlock...it looks like you'd complete that goal rather quickly...and the tips I did unlock were pretty basic.
5. There was a nice variety of music...but I didn't like any of it.

I'm glad that I wasn't able to pre-order it (I'm in Canada) and instead had to wait and read reviews. After seeing so many bad reviews, I decided to rent it first.  I have a 5 day rental from a local video store and will probably return it early.

Thanks to everyone who posted a review! I'm glad to save my money for something else.",2.0
I just rented this to try out other racing games for wii. Doing the mini games like destroying things and stunts was fun but doing the racing was like it was on pro and it wasn't. I couldn't get past 4th and neither could my brother so the racing was very hard. But the other stuff was fun but after awhile it got boring just smashing stuff over and over.,2.0

"I loved the arcade version and the Saturn version of the 2nd VF. The original was a break through in graphics introducing 3-D models, generated by a computer. However, that is all this game has to offer pretty much the graphics are really outdated and aren't colorful like they are in old school street fighter and Streets of rage games. The game play is the biggest down fall by far!",2.0
"Most of the time I disagree with alot of the reviews on Madden or even Ncaa football because I see a bunch of complaining and whining about stupid things. But this I have to agree with some of ya'll this game has too many glitches and just don't seem to measure up. It was a good idea changing the engine but the animations got really fouled up in the process and it just looks bad. I mean players falling over each other,running into another player and falling down, tackles being made looks like the arms legs and neck are broke. Overall this come out bad. EA put out a well known product and made you wait till they decide to make fixes in patches for the game to start playing like somewhat like normal. Most of the time I spend alot of time playing a new Madden or college football game after its released,this year I been so aggrevated the way they turned out I hardly play either one. If you want a good solid EA title play NHL 13 or FIFA 13. Why can't they just make these football titles better like they do in NHL 13 and stop putting something new in it and taking 3 good things away every year. Leave the good alone and make the lacking better. If you want  a good Madden title buy last years version.",2.0
