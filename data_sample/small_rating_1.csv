"The game is great, 5 stars, but anyone paying $350-$400+ dollars for the Wizard's Edition is insane.  The only thing that is really nice to have while playing the game is the hardcover version of the Wizard's Companion.  But is that really worth an extra $300+ dollars!!!  Especially when you can download a pdf of the complete English Wizard's Guide for free, and then bring it to Kinko's and have them spiral bind it for $20.

As for the cute doll and artwork, understand this is not a collectable that will go up in value, a year from now you will be able to buy a Wizard's Edition for under $100.  So for now buy the regular game and either live with using the in game Wizard's Companion or get the pdf for free and view it on a tablet while playing or print it out for now (heck, an online binding service will make a hardcover version for you for less then $100) and then buy the full Wizard's Edition a year from now for a normal price.",1.0
"We had this on pre-order for 2 years. Forza 5 was already out. Since then Forza 6 an 7 came out. What we got was nice visuals,and massive chaos in racing achievements in you as driver versus game challenges. Game is structured around expensive steering wheel controllers. When doing the challenges the car is controlled by the game to a release point. When the car is released so you can now control it,the car is pointed in a negative direction that cost you time in correcting,the screen is full of graphics that block your view of the track,and your supposed to beat a perfect challenge in a time based win time of bronze,silver,and gold. Only after much time with the PS4 controller will you finally achieve a gold. Most of all achievements are earned this way. ""NOT"" much racing happening. Your rank earns what tracks you race on. The game can't tell what cars you already have,so expect to get very dissatisfied with many repeats of awarded cars. Even pre-ordering bonus cars,are duplicated by regular(as if you didn't pre-order) cars. Forza never duplicates any cars in your garage! I know people who have 6 of the same car awarded by game play in their garage! The lack of intelligent programing is so obvious it will disappoint you. This is not Gran Turismo from PS3 or even PS2. Sony was all about shafting it's race car group of players!",1.0
"Despite my having a high-powered PC, the game installs but doesn't run. The menu on the upper left side is frozen and doesn't respond to any kind of cursor movement. I reinstalled it three times to no avail. Junk!",1.0
"No Yao Ming, Michael Redd, Tayshaun Prince etc. Don't waste money buying this.",1.0
"Love this game series. Love playing GTA Liberty City and GTA Vice City on PSP & PS2. I have played them both to completion on each system many times. Love them. Nothing better. However, this game is frustrating because it has no pop up/pull down or whatever you want to call it, map. No map! Just the radar circle thing at the bottom of the screen. Then you're given timed missions with (did I mention) NO MAP! Driving around blind, frustrated and running out of time - I turned the game off and havn't returned and I don't think I ever will. NO MAP!",1.0
"Got these today expecting what the image showed-Pelican brand trigger attachments. I don't know what these are, they don't look like the image. These came in a generic ziplock bag, made of extremely cheap plastic, and they do not fit the controller. I'd send them back if it was more of an expense. Garbage can.",1.0

Cable stopped working after a few months. Only way for it to work now is to waggle the cable and its very annoying. Do not recommend,1.0
"I am a real big fan of all the Soulcalibur games until Soulcalibur ledgens was introduced. first of all let me make one thing clear this is the worst Soulcalibur game ever, if you are planning on buying this game please don't pleassssssssssssse don't. Don't be a victim like me who fell into that trap, because of the game name title soulcalibur I went and buy the game; that was the worst choise I ever made in my entire life. I think that soulcalibur should stay the way it once was as an head to head fighting game. I hope that this review some how reach Namco/Bandi message board, so these game develpers can see what crazy mistakes they have made. All other soulcalibur are great but i can't say the same for Soulcalibur ledgens. Oh yeah let me talk about the wii nunchuck & remote, it's a good innovation but not for a game like soulcalibur, what were the developers thinking; the Nintendo wii has a classic controler which would have work well with the versus mode. This game need to be taken off the shelves for further modifications. Namco/Bandi please keep fighting games where they belong and Adventure games where they belong, I think that this was a bad step for you. I know all the fans of soulcalibur would agree with me, and for all who were having thoughts about buying this",1.0
"Was good for a week, then the home button malfunctions. Controller still works but when I plug it in I am asked if I want to shut down and when I turn the system off it turns back on. It is as if the home button is stuck in the down position. The button don't work either to do anything else, aside from annoy me. I opened the controller thinking it was jammed but it is fine. It is shorted somewhere I think.",1.0
"The PC port is so buggy you can't play it.  It stops at one point and that's it.  None of the posted fixes work.
