"I like RPGs.  I like D&D.  This game, however, was not as good as I would like it to be.  Sure, it's D&D, and it is fun for a little while, but aside from that, it has repetitive music, screwish gameplay, and just horrid graphics (at least for the people and enemies).  I recommend you play this game before you buy, unless you are a hardcore D&D RPGer, or just someone with lots of money.",3.0
"I wasn't to sure about having things laid out for me to play. I am a free form player, and spend a lot of my time building and decorating the homes. But it was a lot of fun to do! I liked the 'chapters' and got to do things that normally you wouldn't do in the other Sims games. I had no loading problems as some people stated. It flowed from each 'chapter' and screen very nicely. I recommend this game if you get bored playing free form. I don't recommend it if you like going to neighborhood views, and building and decorating houses.",5.0

"I initially played Civilization on the PC a couple of years ago, which was pretty fun, but I never got into it wholeheartedly. I was looking for a game that was really just a time killer, and came upon this for the PS3. It's simple yet strategic in the controls and turn-based gameplay. This console version is actually a lot more intuitive than any PC-based versions I've played. The gibberish the characters speak is annoying and the multiplayer function doesn't work most of the time, but if you like boardgames period... it's a good buy. Keep in mind though, it's addicting!

Recommendation: If you like Monopoly or Warcraft II, get it. It's simple, straightforward, and fun.",4.0

"This game builds on top of the previous generation for the PS2, with better graphics, video, camera capabilities and online support.  Some improvements could include wireless mics and better selection of songs out of the box.

My favorite addition is being able to purchase songs online so that you don't have to pay for a lot of songs that you don't want as opposed to buying genre based titles as it's predecessor had you do.

Overall a great and fun gaming experience for a family or a party.",4.0
"I heard about thus game some time ago but never got around to playing it, then one day I was browsing the psn store for something fun to pass the time during  a gaming new release lull when suddenly the name of this game popped into my head, so searched for it there but it wasn't om there. I looked it up and ordered it here the price was low so I figured I was going to be disappointed and I must say I was quite surprised ay how much I enjoyed it I thought it was a great survival horror game i found the story compelling and the game play in my opinion was just as good or even better as some of the ps3 games now I like the fact that you could switch  to any character on the squad at will and that they all had different powers and weapons (Delgado being my favorite)",5.0

"Dragon Age: Origins IS the best rpg on the Ps3, and it's what the system needed.. More RPGs!! I finished my first play through a few days ago so it's still fresh in my mind, and what really kept bringing me back to the controller was the epic story and the feeling of personal involvement. I know many have spoken about the choices in this game. Well I feel that is this games best trait. Here you've got a game where I felt like my choices truely do matter and I will definitely be playing this game many more times through just to see how diverse this game is. I played a city elf male warrior, and didn't think twice about re rolling and trying another class. It's was just that compelling to me. Now at the same time my room mate purchased the PC version of the game, and I saw just how much more tactical control he had. I wish I had gotten this for the PC, but my specs aren't nearly up to par. I already had the ps3 anyways. The battle system was aggrivating to say the least at certain moments, but for the most part it worked fine. I would recommend this game to fans of fantasy and old bioware rpg's like baldurs gate and the likes.

The goods:

Extremely deep story elements and rich history to delve into.. There were parts in this game where I was so wrapped up in the rural dramas going on I had completely forgotten what the main plot of this tale was.. And I consider that a good thing.

DA has some really well developed characters, Morrigan for example, everything about her fascinated me, and the more I found out the more I dug deeper. Each of the characters in the game have personal side quests which I recommend you find. I only did about 3 of them so I will do more in the future play throughs.

Combat in the game plays surprisingly well even though it's on the ps3. At first there were issues with the radial menu, but after 70 hours it becomes second nature. The combat in DA is intense to the point it can become frustrating.. It wasn't ever so frustrating that I couldn't continue, just enough to egg me on to play one more time and try a different strategy.

The art direction in this game was a breath of fresh air. One thing that annoys me to no end is how ugly the characters in western rpgs, here all the models look great! While the graphic engine may seem dated, they utilized it to it's best ability. Good job Bioware.

I purchased all the DLC in this game, and I found it interesting and worth the extra 5 bucks. I'm glad they are making even more which I will definitely support!

The not so goods:

Graphically this game has issues on the ps3, there were certain points in dialogue where there would be no audio for whatever reason, losing chunks of the story.. Other issues were with actual looping of events where they would repeat. I had one friend who said that she had to watch a scene over 4-5 times because it wouldn't stop looping. Finally it stopped and she could continue with the game.. When the battles become large and intense there were issues with frame rate, but it wasn't game breaking at all. I just wish that Bioware would have ironed out these issues prior to release, or even if they patched later like many developers seem to be doing.

This obviously being a port the controller issue is apparent, the definitive version is on the PC, but those without that option the console version is just fine.

Final Thoughts:

At the end of the game there is this deep feeling of accomplishement, and it left me craving more, I can't wait to see where this all leads, and my imagination just runs wild.. I wouldn't spoil anything for anyone, but just take my advice.. If you have the time this game is well worth it. I wouldn't say it's the greatest game of all time, I was just really surprised, and it completely took me away from all the other games I was playing at the time.. And that rarely happens. :)",4.0
"this little gadget is priceless, many say the other versions are better cause they bigger, but that doesn't mean it will gell with your hand.
the dual shock on the other hand is convenient, it's not too small and not too big, its made by sony so no worries their, and the keys are are your fingettips, no sore hands after a couple of hours of gameplay.
also being analog, the harder you press the more the result, this is very obvious in metal gear solid, whereby the harder you press the more bullets are fired.
for me this controller is the best, the other may be cheaper now, but i know this one won't break down in a couple of months.
i did buy the transparent controller last year, but that one just lasted a couple of months then quit working, thats why i trust sonys controller more.",5.0

"When trying to describe the game Okami, several words come to mind....Delightful....Charming....Lovely....Interesting. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that ""fun"" and ""cool"" simply don't seem to cut-it even though those words easily apply as well. I won't go into plot and storyline since many of the other reviews have done an excellent job in detailing. Instead I'd like to tell you why I feel Okami is a must-have game. For those gamers like me who love puzzle and adventure games, Okami is a feast for the soul! Beautiful graphics, charming and witty characters, and plenty of difficult quests to accomplish plus awesome use of the Wii Remote-- This is what you get right from the start. And just when you think the game can't top itself, something mind-blowing happens--Something so unique and imaginative....well....words just fail to describe it. To compare Okami with other games out there is like comparing a fast-food meal off the dollar menu with a three-course meal at a gourmet restaurant. Except that with Okami, you aren't going to pay ""gourmet"" price because unlike other games, Okami is a great value! Basically, what it all comes down to is that Okami is extremely satisfying in pretty much every way....and if you STILL don't believe me, there's nothing else I can say except-- Give it a try! I promise, you will not be sorry.",5.0
"It's obviously not the best console, but since I've bought it I've had a ton of fun with it and consider it a great collectors console. The Sega Dreamcast has a lot of great games like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Soul Caliber, Jet Grind Radio, Blue Stinger, and Carrier to name a few of my favorites. A Dreamcast is definitely worth picking up online or at your local store.",4.0
Awesome series. Good game,5.0
"Save yourself the disappointment. This game is merely a glorified minecraft with spaceships. None of what the developers bragged about is in the game. No factions, no space battles, no diverse planer environments.

Do not buy this game at full price, grab it from the $5 bargin bin or something. It's a blatant example of development teams hyping up their games with fancy self tested ""demos"" and putting in minimum effort to rake in money.",1.0

"Campaign gets worse with higher difficulty. It was somewhat fun at a causal level, but beating it on veteran difficulty was not even satisfying. They just throw more and more guys at you that pop out of nowhere, and it gets very repetitive and dull.

I'd rather have the challenge of strategically working my way through a difficult level then being forced to camp out and take down endless waves of men - fine for one level, but this happened on every, single, level. Just seems like a hack way to produce a new game in a hurry.",1.0
"If Uncharted 4 is the first Uncharted game you've played then, without question, this would be a five-star rating; great graphics, fluid movement, enjoyable gameplay, great voice acting; the storyline was exceptionally delivered; it was like playing a movie. But thats just it, i wanted to play a game, not a movie! Uncharted 4 is just like any other Uncharted; same game play as previous Uncharted, same weapons, almost the same henchmen from the other games, its basically just taking place in a different environment. My biggest issue was the amount of cut scenes and the general lack of actually 'playing' a game; I played nearly two full consecutive chapters without having to fire a single shot (yes, it did help with the overall development of the plot but to me, thats not playing a game).

Overall, I did enjoy the experience of playing Uncharted 4. While its not, in my opinion, a four-star game its better than three, hence my rating.",4.0

"If you are a fan of this game genre, then you won't be disappointed.  The graphics are well done, and the voice acting is fine.  However, the story moves slowly for those accustomed to other types of games.  You basically just sit, watch, and make the occasional choice.  It's a step beyond television, barely.",3.0

"For years, I have heard two things (and I will avoid numerals for this review...).  One...that Final Fantasy 7 was the best Final Fantasy and had the best Final Fantasy villain.  Two...that Final Fantasy 6 was the best Final Fantasy and had the best Final Fantasy villain.  This is where I've found that there are three camps of Final Fantasy fans (although it applies to most RPGs, but I'm sticking with this series for right now.).

Camp 1: The Old School Die Hard---these fans tend to love the originals because of their nostalgic value, medieval setting, and more majestic storylines.
Camp 2: The Next Generation Die Hard---these fans tend to love the later entries because of their showcasing of technology, dark/bleak setting (a la Blade Runner), and innovative systems like limit breaks and materia.
Camp 3: The Die Hard Final Fantasy Fan (what'd ya think I was going to say?)---these fans tend to respect and love all the games, and maybe dislike just one or two but whose reasons have no relation to Camps 1 and 2.

Obviously, Camp 1 will often claim Final Fantasy 6 or 9 as the best entry (maybe even 4), while Camp 2 will very, very likely claim that 7 is the best.  Camp 3 is mixed, although I've found a few of those happen to like the third game the best.

As much as I respect and enjoy Final Fantasy 7, I gravitate towards the first camp because that's the style that I grew up on.  I like swords, sorcery, and high stakes.  I keep an open mind, but a game like Final Fantasy 4 or Chrono Trigger is like a soldier returning home for me.  Anyways, without further explanation, here's my review for Final Fantasy 6.

This game has a very complex plot and despite its totally separate storyline from 7, it is a wonderful lead-in for that game.  The world has previously gone through a horrific ""War of the Magi"" in which the Espers' powers were misused and brought great destruction (Espers are Summons, essentially).  The Espers were given free will but their powers were sealed, never again to be used by man.  The main character, essentially, is Terra (or Tina, depending on the translation you're playing), a half-Esper/half-human that went through excruciating circumstances before taking control of her life.  There's a slew of characters you meet in the entire game; Locke is a treasure hunter with the Steal technique.  Edgar is the king of Figaro, an engineer, and twin brother of Sabin.  Sabin had forsaken his royal heritage to study Martial Arts.  Celes is a former imperial soldier who also has Esper powers due to their experiments on her (and can absorb magic through her swords).  Cyan was the king of Doma, a kingdom of Samurai, and he seeks revenge on Kefka.  There's also Shadow, a ninja with a mysterious past and has a dog named Interceptor that aids him when he needs it.  There are other memorable characters that include Setzer (a gambler) and a feral child named Gau, but I'll leave you to discover the others (preferably by playing the game, but I suppose I can't stop you from Wikipedia-ing it).

Although it appears Emperor Gestahl is the main villain in the beginning, our main antagonist is Kefka.  While other villains like Sephiroth (7) and Kuja (9) have interesting motives, Kefka has my stamp of approval for being the absolute best villain in the series.  I've got three reasons why.

1. He is the most ruthless villain in the series.  He wipes out the entire kingdom of Doma by poisoning the water (including Cyan's family), captures the Esper god statues and unleashes terror, and shows unconditional contempt for the good qualities in humanity.  He turns on his emperor in the blink of an eye, hungry for the power of the Espers.
2. He is one of the goofiest tyrants I've ever seen in a video game.  Before he marches off to Figaro, he orders his soldiers to wipe the sand from and off his boots (Figaro is in the desert).  He also torments Cyan for his misfortune, repeatedly laughing in his face.  When the heroes confront him before the final battle, he says HATE HATE HATE over and over and over again, shaking his fists in an anime-sort of way.  He also has that funny laugh that makes its way into Chrono Trigger.
3. He has one of the coolest boss themes in any video game, period.

The game takes on a late industrial/western feel to it, largely in part to the artists and Nobou Uematsu's variant score.  Uematsu hit a bullseye in scoring this puppy; from Terra's slow, journeyman-like theme to Shadow's spaghetti western-style theme, to some of the catchiest battle music you've ever heard in your life, to the ragtime/opera suites in the more artsy sections of the game...the music score overall is perhaps Uematsu's most diverse music that I've ever heard in a video game.  There are majestic moments that will remind you of Final Fantasies 4 or 9, but here is where the two camps merge into one.  Magic is dying out in the storyline, and the music reflects that.

Awesome music, adventorous map (there's two ""worlds"" by the way, play and find out...), complex plot, interesting characters (ALL of them having a unique skill) and the ability to have up to four fighting at once, innovative battle systems (there's three points in the game where you split your characters into two or three teams, depending on where you are in the game, and you can switch between them and fight a lot of battles), gameplay longevity without ever getting boring...I have not found any fault in this game, and while I do find it to be a long game, it does have a replay value to it.

So who do I recommend this to?  Because of its difficulty level (which isn't impossible, but it may be troublesome if you've never played an RPG before), I might suggest trying Final Fantasies 4 or 7 first, but if you happen to be in the third camp that loves both of those games, I guarantee that you will enjoy this game.  It is the perfect lead-in to Final Fantasy 7 by aesthetics and setting alone, and I can't think of a better way to intrigue both the medieval Fantasy fans and the more modern Fantasy fans.  I also guarantee that you will love the characters and love their backstories.

Saddle up, turn on the nostalgic dial, grab your weapon of choice, and march into battle for one of the greatest adventures that Squaresoft (er, Square Enix...) has to offer.  I see no reason why you would dislike this game.  Perhaps the best Final Fantasy game in existence, with FF4 and FF9 in close proximity and FF7 following those.

Recommendations:
1. Chrono Trigger (classic SNES game)
2. Super Mario RPG (SNES, the perfect beginner's RPG)
3. Final Fantasy 4 (worthy RPG for the first-time fan)
4. Castlevania Symphony of the Night (a combination of classic RPG elements and Super Metroid-style gameplay)",5.0

"What captures right away the eye are the wonderful landscapes: colors, grass, sea, the sun that moves through the horizon with all its spectacular effects.
Now, what happens in the game: you begin out as a Mecc, a tecnologic warrior that has to help out some strange alien little wierdos called smarties in their combat for existence against the evil sea reaper race.
As the game goes on you will control from one to five meccs, then control a beautiful reaper woman who allies with the meccs and in the end you will become the allmighty Kabuto...but I won't tell you who that guy is, even if it's easy to figure it out.
The game is divided in chapters, 5 for each kind of character you are going to control (mecc, reaper, Kabuto) and the missions are interesting and fortunately not too easy.
Best part of it: the fly sensation. The meccs have a jetpack and the reaper has an incredible ""turbo"" power that actually make them fly or jump granting you an exceptional almost real ""speed and fly"" sensation.
Bad part of it:
1) no in mission saves, if you die you start the whole mission over again.
2) bugs, sometimes the whole game blinks out of existence and you end up staring at the desktop after losing an hour and a half on a mission...and as I said, you couldn't save. So, ok, let's do it all over again.
Overall: Great ideas, wonderful grafics, very original plot and characters, original game structure...but it could have been realized better.",4.0

"I was initially excited about playing GOW3 after playing through the full game and beating it, I was left feeling not completely impressed with such a major release of an exclusive ps3 title such as GOW3. When comparing this game with other heavy hitter titles out there such as Uncharted 2, MGS4, Batman Arkham Asylum, Heavy Rain, MW2, this game fell short of beating any of these titles. First of all the story, what story? Kratos is not posed by a threat his only problem is he wants to find and kill Zeus thats it. Second the graphics, GOW3 is inferior in the graphic department when compared to Uncharted 2, MGS4, and FFXIII.Making the characters look like they are made of porcelain does not equal realism.  This game is still plaqued by bad camera angles as the other games in this series. The voice acting is poor also, with Pandora having the worst voice in the game. Her speech actually annoyed me. Kratos has the vocabulary of an angry 6 yr old, speaking in short agressive sentences, using short words. The game did have a decent soundtrack to make you play more. The biggest thing that I left disappointed about was the action. I understand that this is a Rated M game, but being barbaric does not equal being a great action game. Overall IMO this is an over-hyped cash cow for Sony.  My ratings below:
Story-5
Graphics-7
Voice Acting-6
Action-8
Soundtrack-9
Overall rating-7",3.0
"I have been a fan of the Need form Speed series form a while now and this game only improves on the prior success of the series.  The game as plenty of fun game play both on the racer career and cop career.  I also find this game to be one of the most visually stunning games available for next generation consoles. It also happens to be the first 3rd party game capable of running at 1080p on both the Ps4 and the Xbox One.  The main issues I have is that it tends to take at least three minutes to find a game and start upon load up and often during the middle of a gamer it will drop connection and shift you to a different open world.

"When I saw this only had four stars I had to review it. Since the intimate details have already been drawn out at length several times over I won't go through all that stuff, I'll just discuss what I liked most about this game.

I had fun in this game because it has a lot varied scenarios and missions. It jumps to different characters in a plot and even has a flash back to several years earlier (the infamous sniper level).

And the level that takes place entirely in grainy black-and-white as you fire different sized shells at ground targets I thought I was extremely fun. I forget which aircraft you're in while doing that (I'm sure I'd be corrected anyway).

The plot, as the title implies, is in modern times or ""current day"". The plot lines are similar to a season of 24 (middle eastern terrorists play with nukes along side some Russians). I loved the cinematic style and jumping between perspectives.

I haven't tried a lot of the online stuff, but gaining experience points to customize your character is a rather awesome idea.

"I've been using this headset for a few weeks, primarily for XBOX 360, chatting with my friends as we play.  The headset is built very well, seems quite durable (beefy headband, ear padding is well-attached), and the sound is simply amazing.  The only criticism related to build quality would be the microphone jack.  I've noticed the rubber/plastic surround on the mic mini plug is already starting to separate.  Minor issue, and I don't know that it'll ever impact usability.

The included control module is confusing, to say the least.  Lots and lots of buttons, dials, and switches.  Be prepared to use the manual to figure it all out.  That said, it's complicated because there are A LOT of features and options.

The nemesis system is nice, but its really just a series of randomly generated orc names + titles. Calling it a SYSTEM is patting yourself on the back.

However, it is an interesting change of pace to have captains enter your battle who have different skills and are often much tougher to beat than regular enemies.

"I actually own the ""Stealth"" version of this.  I've got a 2012, and a 2013 model (for two different computers).  There are also non-""ultimate"" versions which lack the backlighting (and possibly the USB hub/audio pass through).

There are reviews on here saying there are problems with the space bar on some earlier versions of the Blackwidow, but my 2012, and now 2013 models are flawless.  Whatever was going on in earlier years, Razer seems to have completely solved it.

The difference between the ""regular"" and ""stealth"" versions of this keyboard are that the ""regular"" one uses Cherry MX Blue switches, and the ""stealth"" one uses Cherry MX Brown.  Blues require more force to press (I think 55g vs. 45) and also make a louder clicking sound.  There are other Cherry MX switches too, and honestly I have no idea which I'd prefer, as no local stores have any mechanical keyboards on display...my bestbuy carries ONE mechanical keyboard (with blue switches) and doesn't actually have it out.

Since I couldn't actually compare in real life, and I was a bit worried about how loud the blue switches might be, I settled on brown.  No idea if they'd be my favorites if I could try everything, but they are excellent, and VASTLY superior to membrane keyboards.

So what are membrane keyboards?  Back in the old days with IBM's original PCs, and up into the 90s, keyboards would typically have mechanical switches.  They'd last a long time, and feel fantastic to type on.  At some point (it seems like in the 90s) companies started figuring out that they could replace mechanical switches with a rubber membrane to save money.  I didn't realize what was going on at the time, but I noticed my new PCs were coming with progressively worse keyboards, harder to type on, mushier, etc.  (Notebooks of course also lack mechanical keyboards and are junky compared to these.)

Anyway, FINALLY a few years ago companies started selling consumer mechanical keyboards again as sort of high-end accessories.  They cost more because they cost more to build...BUT not really that much more, as you can easily pay $60 or more for a junky membrane keyboard.

The difference in typing on a mechanical versus membrane is just night and day.  It might take you a day or two to really appreciate it, but every key press always works the same.  They're not mushy, they don't stick, they just ""feel"" right as you type.  It's easier to type faster, you make fewer mistakes.

Typing on the Razer Blackwidow/Cherry MX Browns is just silky smooth.  It's almost like typing on a cloud...I don't know, I can't explain it, but it's just SUCH a pleasure.  I go from being angry at my keyboard to actually getting a little thrill when I sit down to punch in my password in the morning.

It's simply a night and day difference, and WELL worth the money, considering you interact with your keyboard constantly.  Mechanical switches also last much longer than membrane stuff does (I finally switched to one after the space bar on my TERRIBLE Microsoft board collapsed).  Each switch is rated for 50 million key presses.  (Oh, I didn't even mention, the switches themselves are German.)

When I originally did research on which keyboard to buy, I settled on Razer's Blackwidow because it was one of the few (maybe the only at the time) that had media keys on it.  For me, media keys are pretty much a necessity on a modern PC.  One of the few complaints I could level at this  board is that the media keys aren't dedicated, instead there's a function key you hold while pressing function keys.  i.e. F6 is play/pause when the function key is held down, F1, 2, and 3 control volume, etc.

It's worth nothing, the keyboard works fine without Razer's drivers installed. It works as a keyboard, and the media keys work using just Windows' built in drivers.  I don't like installing extra driver software if I can help it, so I appreciate that.

I'm not sure if the macro keys work without Razer's driers, but I don't have a use for them anyway.

At the time, Das Keyboard lacked media keys.  The current version actually has them, but now there are countless reports of problems with the new keyboards.  They actually sound similar to (if not worse than) the problems Razer USED to have a few years ago.  Hence I ended up just getting this year's model of the Blackwidow Stealth Ultimate, and am once again quite pleased.

(Worth noting I suppose that the 2012 version had blue lighting, the 2013 has green.)

Don't be scared off by this being a ""gaming"" keyboard.  I play and love games, but that's not why I bought this...I needed something good to TYPE on.  As with most PC releated things, ""gaming"" doesn't mean much beyond ""higher quality"" (i.e. Alienware's ""gaming"" PCs have great cooling and are great well rounded high end notebooks that are good for everything-same deal here).  Other than the macro keys to the left of the keyboard, this is a very traditional keyboard.  You could be coming from a 1982 IBM to this and feel right at home.

I've yet to use the audio passthrough, so don't know if that works.  And while this has two USB ports, you don't actually have to plug both in.  They're clearly labeled that one's for the keyboard itself, the other is for the USB port on the keyboard.  I just have the keyboard plugged in, and it and the backlighting work perfectly.

Even the physical cords they use are great-high end braided/material stuff instead of the normal cheaper rubbery stuff.  Not a huge deal either way, but clearly Razer's trying to make a high end product here, and succeeding.

Basically this is a GREAT choice if you're sick of membrane keyboards, need a replacement, or whatever.  The closest thing to a complain I have is the USB ports were a tight fit on my USB hub for some reason, but everything works great now that it's plugged in.

A family member I gave another board to loves it too...she doesn't use it for much more than browsing the web, but still vastly prefers it to her previous membrane keyboard.

"The Inside Out Play Set is a lot of fun, though it is a bit different than the others.

"Jet Set Radio. Viewtiful Joe. Gun Valkyrie. These are games that you'll never hear a mainstream gamer talk about. They are games for the hardcore, die-hard, take-no-prisoners-and-get-no-sleep-till-you-break-the-highscore gamers. They emphasize gameplay and innovation over graphics and accesability. But they are  brilliant in their own way, and so just plain DIFFERENT in their dynamics and control schemes that they make you unlearn what you have learned. This is THAT kind of game.

If you are expecting a typical action game you will be diappointed. If you are expecting highly polished graphics you will be disappointed. If you are expecting greatness that requires patience, practice, and dedication that only the hardcore can muster you will be blown away. The story is simple. In the future a mercenary has been dispatched to destroy the robots on a colony world that have gone awry and started attacking anything that moves. She is one Vanessa Schneider, a skin-tight armored bodysuit wearing chick who is short on words and fast on acrobatic manuevers. Through a series of simple text explanations you are briefed on the situation of each level, and then you run and gun your way through every room in the level until you beat the level boss and get a chance to save your save before progressing to the next level. It all sounds so simple. And it is. And it isn't.

You see, the control system is optimized for acrobatics, not for changing direction. You don't walk. You run (by pushing forward). You don't turn. You change direction (by hitting the Z button to turn around or Z and another direction for a 90 degree turn). You don't jump. You flip through the air forward or backward. And sorry, but you don't run or jump and shoot at the same time. You stand still and shoot, and when the time is right you dodge or jump out of the way (or crouch). Well, actually, you can turn, but it is slow and awkward. You will quickly find that it is far more effective to dodge to sidestep or cartwheel in a direction (right or left trigger) rather than wasting time turning. It sounds odd and it is. It is also genius.

When you are doing poorly this game is very frustrating, as you fall off ledges over and over and keep taking hits and getting killed by the robots' laser fire. The trick is to overcome the limitations, or rather the UNIQUENESS of the control scheme, and make Vanessa DANCE across the levels in a sort of high-speed blasting ballet. When you are doing well, and with practice you will, this game is wonderful. It's like every Mila Jovovich movie was combined into one long action sequence. You backflip and cartwheel and shoot energy blasts, timing your shots and dodging out of the way in the nick of time. You destroy huge bosses in seconds and backflip and dodge through the air, barely touching the ground as you back away from lasers chasing you. Everything moves to a rhythm, and every moment you stand still Vanessa keeps tapping in time to the music, like she's itching for action and can't bear to stand still. The graphics are not crystal clear or razer sharp. They have artfacting and pixelation and jaggies like look kind of like a low resolution video feed. I love it. The rooms of the complexes look incredibly retro and spartan like like they came out of Space Channel 5, all smooth lines and bare walls. I like the purity of gameplay the spartan presentation highlights. No distractions here. And there ARE outdoor segments and a timed escape to break up the repetition (with some great dust wind blowing and searchlights to run from). And of course there is a boss at the end of every level which you must defeat BEFORE saving your progress.

You can upgrade your battle suit throughout the game by cashing in the points you are awarded for destroying enemies in combos (a timer starts whenever you destroy an enemy), finishing rooms quickly, and finishing rooms without taking any damage. All the suits have different strengths and weaknesses (and colors), and collecting them provides some replay value as well as motivation to score well (suits are very expensive). There is also a trial mode of levels to unlock, and all purchased suits can be upgraded for a price.

The key to enjoying this game is to master its difficult controls, to grow to love its unique presentation, and revel in its unique and amazing gameplay. I love action games, and difficult ones are ultimately the most rewarding if you have the patience for them and they are well balanced. I love this this game, and if you feel the same way about action games I highly recommend a rental, if not a purchase.",5.0

"Got this game this past christmas and only recently had a chance to pop it into my Vita and give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised

Never played an Uncharted game before, but I have constantly heard good things about the series. If this game is any indication of how good the mainline series is, I will definitely have to check it out.

Drake is very smart mouthed, but charming. He thinks his way out of problems and chooses the path of least resistance. Lots of fun dialog between Nathan and the other cast members. There are a few times I recall laughing aloud at his comments. ""I think I can see my house from here"" as he traverses a steep cliff side.

Graphics are very impressive for the Vita. Possibly the best example of what the device was capable of. Granted this was almost four years ago and most smart phones can do more complex stuff now.

So what didn't I like about the game?

A lot of the game forces you into these invisible corridors. There is hardly any exploration off the path the developers want you to follow. You think you can hop on a broken pillar or crawl into a hole, but nope. Just nice decorations and eye candy.

My main gripe is every touch control in the game is basically a gimmick. They were created to justify the existence of touch on the Vita. They offer you this asinine touch scheme, but 50% of the time you can ignore it and just use the joysticks. Here are some examples:

Climb a rope by swiping your fingers up the back track pad OR just the joystick
Climb a rock face by touching the footholds OR just use the joystick
Aim your gun by using the gyro in the vita OR just use the joystick

You absolutely have to use the touchpad for puzzles, grenade use, and QTE. No way around those. The only time the Vita had a unique and interesting control was when you use an external light on the back track pad to reveal a map on parchment paper. The coolest thing and you only do it one time.

Now since touch scheme is so unfortunately ingrained into the game, this game is NOT PS TV compatible. Which is a total shame since it would have looked nice on a bigger screen. All those gimmicky touch controls ruined a superior experience for this game.

With the game being sub 20$ or even 10$ if you willing to go used, it is a great value. Probably not so much when people bought it at launch. I would recommend.",3.0

"Okay, so the original Half Life is almost 3 years old now, but you still love it don't you? You play the mods on the Internet. The awesome storyline, the interactive scenery, the scientists that babble to each other and get sucked into ventilation shafts. Great wasn't it?
The best thing about this expansion pack is that it upgrades the original game and Opposing Force graphically - better weapons, and more detailed aliens. And you know what that means? You're going to have to play the first 2 games again before starting on this one! It's worth it!
In Blue Shift, you play the security guard which you meet as Gordon Freeman in the first game right at the start. Originally supposed to be a bonus game on the Dreamcast, the developers have made it into a full game.
This should be it for expansion packs, Valve should take this away for a bit and come back with Half Life 2 based on the Doom 3 engine for example, this is probably the last mission pack they can squeeze out of this narrative. Essential.",5.0

"Just Youtube ""Solstice Intro"".

The opening song alone should make any old-school gamer's heart melt. And the music doesn't let it. It remains good throughout the game.

The gameplay of Solstice is that of a puzzle-platformer. Your wizard's lady-friend is kidnapped and now you need to do something about it. You progress by picking up blocks, jumping on platforms, gathering keys and spells, and so forth. It uses a unique (for the time) diagonal perspective that might be tough to control.

All in all, Solstice is a solid game with a rockin' soundtrack. As crazy as it sounds, sometimes I pop in the cartridge just to hear the opening tune blast through my speakers.",4.0

"I picked this up on sale for $30. I'm probably 10-12 hours into the game. Even after its been out all this time, this is one of the most buggy/glitchy games I've seen in a long time.

Textures pop in and out constantly. At one point, the entire ground textures all turned to black and the lighting somehow became really bright. Stayed that way until I died. Enemy AI is terrible as well. Shot a truck and blew it up with a cop right across the street. He only came after me when I stole another truck behind the burning one.

"I received this special edition Reach Xbox 360 on release day and, after spending a full 12 hours with the game, I can honestly say that Halo Reach is the most feature-packed FPS ever created and it is THE BEST HALO to date period. Many reviewers out there really just bring the score down for minutely small details and flaws such as taking too many shots to kill enemies or comparing it to Modern Warfare 2. However, with this sort of game, you really have to look at the big picture, admiring the package as a whole and how carefully polished each aspect of the game is even though some parts of the game may be slightly imperfect.
The campaign is the second best of the series, following the masterpiece story that was excellently told in Halo: CE. The third best would be that of Halo 3: ODST for personal reasons despite the second and third games' epic scales. While friendly A.I. are helpful on grounded missions, they become utterly atrocious behind the wheel just as with all other halo games. Fortunately, the enemy A.I., especially the Elites, are absolutely nightmarish to deal with on heroic/legendary. Their complex and unpredictable behavior and the sandbox qualities of each level adds tons of replay value to the campaign.
If the campaign isn't enough for you, head on over to the bread-and-butter of Bungie's excellent series, the multi-player, now including tons of customization,options, and a plethora of modes to choose from. A beefed up forge, firefight, huge maps, and the inclusion of armor abilities add a whole layer of fresh to the series.
When starting the game up, I noticed the menu layout was especially striking and sleek. This amount of polish and care is carried over to all parts of the game. Imagine that!
While Bungie has always been super artistic with all of their games, the art, design, and visuals in this game are the best of the series and make you stop in your steps and drool at the amazingly detailed and believable background vistas and back-drops. It's truly a sight to behold and gives the planet Reach its own character. In addition, wildlife makes its first appearance in this game, which is a definite plus in my book.

The system itself is a true collector's item.  From the silver matte finish to the custom halo sounds, even though they are fairly quiet, this system is just screaming Halo and win all over.  The designs on the controllers and the system are also very indicative of the halo universe and bring the console to life.

In the end, Halo Reach is absolutely stunning in every aspect and delivers on all fronts despite few, if any, flaws and poor design choices. If you're a Halo fan and you want to witness a satisfying conclusion to the Halo series by Bungie, don't even think one second and pick this game up ASAP even if you're a newcomer to the Halo series. There's something in this game for everyone! I'd even hand over more than $60 for a game like Halo Reach. Seriously, it's that great.",5.0

"Great game. I decided to get both versions, mainly this version for the Multiplayer, and the PS4 version for the Campaign. Graphically this isn't bad, even at 720p..and the controls are WAY more responsive, and a lot faster than the PS4 version. Especially when it comes to aiming and shooting. The PS4 version is tight, but slower. Not sure why that is. Could be the 900p resolution, but I think it's just slight input lag. So both versions look very close graphics wise. But this version is the best for multiplayer. Also a lot more people are on XB1 playing this than on PS4. I tried it, didn't care for it on there. Also very few people were on. So it's great no matter what platform you choose. I think they should have redone the first Titanfall for PS4, and put it for free with this one. And cleaned it up a bit, and with a higher resolution. For people who heave NEVER played it. This one is better in some ways, but not quite as original. The campaign was greatly needed though, and a lot of fun. See ya!",4.0

I just thought it was too good to be true to get it despite that the fact that they were like hundreds of dollars for a brand new one. And until I saw one for only $23.00 NEW! That's right, NEW just by buying this I saved over hundreds of dollars of buying a new one. I bought it because I wanted a collector's Item so that I can display it in my room. I will NEVER use it or take out the controller cause I want it to stay New and fresh till the day I die!! LOL

That and I already have a controller that's the SNS102 and SNS005 so yeah no need to take it out. And I'm also happy that it looks just like the one on the picture. Only thing is that I just wish it could of been shrink wrapped but doesn't matter. As long as it's new and smells new I'll take it.

"Deus Ex is a first person shooter rpg. It is one of the best games ever made with a long and excellent single player gameplay and with a great replay value. It has a great and lenghty storyline. Set in the future, the world is in bad shape with martial law almost all cities, there is poverty and famine everywhere, now a plague called grey death has broken out. Besides a great story the player will be given options of what to say everywhere and the story changes the way you play. Like in the first mission you have to take over the terrorist in the statue of liberty, if you killed the terrorist leader then after a few missions someone will take revenge. In another you have to save a girl hostage, if you save her you will be rewarded and if you failed the game will continue it does not say mission failed, restart level, and the game has three great endings. You play J.C.Denton an agent in the unatco with his brother paul. Unatco is an anti terrorist agency, a few missions later you will find out what the agency really is. Denton is a bionic man who can be trained to hack computers, pick locks, use powerfull weapons and even move or swim faster with the nanotech upgrades. Deus Ex's level design is fantastic, You can go anywhere and do anything you want. All the objectives have several approaches to complete, there is always a door you can blow it open with explosives, a door with a lock you can pick, a door with a computerised lock you can hack open ect. The world detail is fantastic, you can turn on the shower, operate the soda machine ect, there are also a lot of secrect passage. Be sure to explore all the places and talk to everyone you see and the crosshair shows green before going to the next level.
Deus Ex is very hard game and you upgrade your skills as you play. Players may find the game very frustrating as they will find themselves without enough ammo, multitool or lockpicks, that is mostly because they wasted their inventory. Deusex is a game in which every bullet and other items you use matters. It is also a game to save every minuite, it is better to save before every combat and reload the game if you wasted a lot of inventory items and not only if you got killed. The AI is very bad, but i think it is part of the game, as it is not a game with you as a heavily armed soldier must kill all the smart bad guys and procced to the next level. It is a game which gives you hard choices and second guess every action you do. Only the correct choices will get you past the bad guys even if they are very dumb. Deusex multiplayer is also good, It is a much different experiance from other games, you have to hack computers ect. Deus Ex is built on the unreal tournament engine. I played it on the Direct3D video mode and the game runs very smooth, load times were good. The first version may be optimised only for 3dFx-Glide but this version has a great direct3d code. I played it on direct3d 800x600x32 with detail textures and the game runs fine, opengl support is also quite good. The bad things are, the graphics are not very good, the charecters look very ugly, save games take large disk space. But the great gameplay makes up for it. Deus Ex is one of the best games i have ever played, it deserves the game of the year award. Get Deus Ex, It is the game of the future.",5.0
"It's alright.  The fishing is fun, but the multiplayer stinks.  That was the whole reason we bought it so we are very disappointed.  Multiplayer is only in the main game by having a second person fish along with you.  The second person is not customizable in any way and it doesn't save his/her record.",3.0
"All things considered, this is a great keyboard.  I've used it for about a month now and I think this is the best value in a mechanical keyboard anywhere at this price point.
But it does have one wart of a minor nature, that of the font they used for the key tops.  It's as though they wanted to go with an old military stencil kind of font but which they only partially implemented.  It's hardly a show-stopper because the action of the keyboard is near flawless, unlike the AZIO mechanical keyboard it replaced.  The AZIO had sticky keys and uncertainty in actually getting the letter you thought you pressed.
Not this keyboard though, the SADES K10 has been flawless in use.  But because I occasionally actually look at the key tops to be sure I'm getting the right key, the key top font throws me off a little.  Not enough to be a problem but just distrcting as you do a double-take to make sure your hands are lined up correctly.
Another slight issue is the illumination brightness but that is controllable in 4 steps - it's just that when you press the FN key it appears to transmit that keycode over to machine you're using rather than keeping it local to the keyboard.  But not worth lowering the rating for - a minor nit.
Anyway - highly recommend this keyboard - at this price point it has to be the best mechanical keyboard out there!",5.0

"Are your Sims ready for a vacation?  Do they need a break?  Well now that vacation isn't a trip to the spa it's a trip with a hotel stay and MORE!

"As a Vita owner, it was hard to adjust to the standard 3DS screen. The XL does fine though. It runs good, looks good, and obviously it has a great library of games.

I will however admit that I'm disappointed how old some of the features feel.  The interface isn't very responsive (pressing 'home' takes 2-3 seconds to be acknowledged), the store isn't intuitive at all and the fact that I don't have an account associated with my advice discourages me from making any purchases.  I'm also disappointed with the friend features. I would almost be OK with the friend code concept if you could get an alert when someone adds you.  Instead you have to blindly add each other separately in order to see each other.

My other disappointment is the complete lack of virtual console titles. The GBA had some of the greatest handheld games in history, so I don't understand why a good number of them arent' available to download. Instead they give you old Gameboy and NES games. It's absurd, for example, that both original Zelda games for the NES are available, Link's awakening is available (GB game), and of course there is the Ocarina of Time remake.. But Link to the past isn't available, nor is Minish Cap. One had a SNES version, and both had a GBA version.

So I know this is mainly complaining, but you already know why you want a 3DS.  I could go into detail about how much fun Pokemon X was or how much I look forward to finally playing Shin Megami Tensai 4.  So the above is my justification for taking a star off, the 3DS is great but it isn't perfect in my opinion.",4.0

"Yep, its 2015 and I just finished Genji: Dawn of the Samurai and it was great!!  I have owned both Genji and the Onimusha series for years and have never got around to playing either. This year I decided to boot up the old PS2 and give it a go. I tried Genji first but did not like the effeminate looking Samurai and opted to revisit it later. In the meantime I played through Onimusha 1 and 2 and got hooked to magical hack and slash. It wasn't long before I was immersed, Onimusha is excellent in presenting the environments and stories of Feudal Japan.

Before playing through Onimusha 3, I decided to go back and try Genji again..but surprisingly this time I got hooked! The first thing that stands out is the camera; it is much better in Genji than in Onimusha, enemies are never off screen or attacking from blind spots like they are in Onimusha. Though both games have pre-rendered or static backgrounds Genji has superior views and angles. Most importantly the controls in Genji are much better than Onimusha..though I am use to Onimusha's tank controls because I am an Old School gamer... the fluidity of movement with the analog stick is superior in every way.

One thing clear about the Onimusha series is the production values; the graphics, FMV, story, voice acting, and use of real actors is superb. Amazingly Genji equals Onimusha in that regard as well! I found the graphics, voice acting, FMV, scenery, particle effects to be just as impressive if not moreso in Genji! Both games offer control of multiple characters but Genji includes RPG-like character building where you can customize Yoshitsune and Benkai however you like. Though Genji offers many more weapons they are available much to quickly. Some of them you may not use at all whereas in Onimusha every weapon you get is useful and necessary for progression.

One area where Onimusha outshines Genji is in puzzles. Genji is 100% fighting, exploring, customizing, and interacting with NPC's. There are no puzzles, traps, or environmental hazards to avoid. It is pure hack and slash and the game ushers you on to the climax and conclusion rather quickly. Also in regards to enemies Onimusha offers more variety. There are many different enemy types in Onimusha most of them supernatural or born of dark magic whereas Genji is more rooted in reality, there is a dose of dark magic but most of your enemies are human with the most extreme enemy types being akin to experimental forms of wild animals.

Overall I think Genji is an excellent rival and competitor to the Onimusha series it is unfortunate more Genji titles where not released on PS2. I can tell that the developers put a lot of time, effort, and heart into creating the game. I consider Genji: Dawn of the Samuari to be among the best ""hidden gems"" I've played on the PS2 thus far!",4.0
"I am a huge fighting game fan, but I've never liked the button mashing variety of fighting games.
Until now. Soul Calibur is a fun game that keeps me coming back for more.  From powerful brutes like nightmare and asteroth to fast fighters like Sophitia and taki to everyone else in between, this game is one of my favorites.
It's simple enough to pick up for anyone.  1 button for horizantal strikes, 1 for vertical strikes, 1 for kicks and 1 for blocking.  But the strength likes in it's combo system.  Even a newbie can get some combos by mashing buttons, but someone who knows what thier doing can wipe the floor with all challengers.
In short, Best fighting game ever.",5.0
"I bought this game as part of a set with Hidden Mysteries - Buckingham Palace. I enjoyed the historical information and game play in the Buckingham Palace game; but this Civil War counterpart was FAR LESS FUN and VERY DARK. It was difficult to view whole sections of the screen, because the coloring seemed overly dark.

My biggest frustration was the miniscule size of many of the objects. The game creator apparently found it too difficult to artistically conceal all of the various objects, so he/she resorted to making some of them so tiny that the gamer would need a magnifying glass to actually identify those objects. That shows a lack of talent as a game creator. The objects should be 'hidden' not just reduced to a size that makes them almost invisible. The talent lies in the imaginative way that the objects are blended into their environment.

I got tired of this game is a very short time. I will enjoy the Buckingham Palace instead.",2.0
"How many Fighting games currently compile the GameCube's library?  So far, in it's undersized life-span only one and a definitely adrenaline-pumping masterpiece at that.  Although Super Smash Bros. Melee is a splendid title that bests its processor in every virtual way, it lacks the fundamentals of a hardcore, garishly flashy beat-em-up.  Hudson is going to bring just that beat-em-up bouquet by localizing Bloody Roar: Primal Fury.  Comprised of every bit of Bloody Roar 3 on the PS2, Primal Fury is a slightly enhanced version.  Finished in a fantastic graphical nimbleness, the GameCube's edition easily makes a name for itself.  Eighting, the makers behind the game, brings a whole new dimension to their steadily growing franchise.
Packed with new stages, characters, and extra gameplay modes, Primal Fury actually seems more of a straight-from-the bloody-box sequel rather than a rehash of some marginal port.  If you are skeptical about the GameCube's control scheme, do not cower young mates, for it handles the sweaty brawls particularly well.  For those who have had no account on a Bloody Roar title, the emphasis of it is essentially being a true 3D button-smashing bedlam.  Expect gut-wrenching combos at outrageous miles per hour, plus the techno, guitar riffs ripping throughout the stages.  The difference from the Bloody Roar series to that of other fighters, is that Bloody Roar has a feature that lets players transform their characters into a superior animal form -- a Hyperbeast!  Each character has a specific animal transformation, from an insect to a lion to other ferocious beasts.  When in Hyperbeast mode, deadlier medleys of combos and strength are unbuckled.  Augmenting a nice twist to the fray, this time in Primal Fury, Hyperbeast is no longer activated by filling up on a meter, but can be activated whenever the player fancies.  But, at the cost of the player's health.  A definite strategic element, Primal Fury is very balanced and the change is much appreciated to thwart a brainless remake of the PS2 original.  The fighting system aside, Primal Fury has a rooster of 16 playable fighters, nine engrossing environments, and neck-to-neck combat that has characters on screen look like two juggernauts springing into Rated-R action.  Ideally, playing through the game and its available modes unlocks extra modes.  Within time all areas such as Time Attack, Team Battle, Training Mode, and Extra Multiplayer ones will be freely accessible.
On a graphical mark, Primal Fury is an artistic vortex of seizure-enticing clutter.  Overhauling the PS2's graphical engine, the work on Primal Fury is apparent with its beautifully rendered world.  From the brightly polished backgrounds, such as Chinese temples, an aquarium, a freeway in twilight, a laboratory, and much more, the game is crafted in an aesthetic fluidity.  Heightened with visual upgrading, all the stages and characters have been refined into an expansion of quicker loading processing and a higher amount of detail on the combat side.  Running on a breakneck 60fps like most GameCube games, its a wonder how the system can mange to trap all the scenery and percolate spectacular lighting effects to the littlest facet.  It's truly an environment felt in an extremely slick costume that is veritable to the achievement of  Primal Fury's enchantment.
I wouldn't go as far as to say Super Smash Bros. Melee has a bleak fight against a predominate opponent who is best suited for the GameCube, but I can verbalize how much praise and hurrah Bloody Roar: Primal Fury falls under.  Adding a dazzling fighter in all its combo juggling and loud bone-snapping battles, this game is welcomed onto the GameCube library.  With simplistic controls, a bunch of moves to master, and not to mention a satisfying number of wacky fighters to choose from, Primal Fury is streamlined enough to grab your own bloody copy.",4.0

"Let me start this, with the fact that I am not a sports guy, at all. I don't play sports, or watch sports (although I AM really into exercising).

Okay, back to the main point: the game.

My girlfriend at the time was a softball player, and I got this game to have fun, while learning about the game.
I was not disappointed.

Story mode is basically just for unlocking characters. It is really fun to design your teams, as there is a good deal of customization that you can do team-wise. You can play against AIs, but this game really shines in multi-player. It is a lot of fun to play with friends.

There are two ways to play: wii remote alone, or wii remote and nunchuk. With wii remote alone, it is basically glorified wii sports baseball (fielding is automatic). But if you play with the nunchuk, you get to control the fielding yourself. The controls for this are complex, and there is a relatively steep learning curve. It's totally worth it though, because you get to be in control of all aspects of the playing.

I learned about how the game is played, and it was a lot of fun to play with her as well as some of my other friends.

"I bought this because I am a Half Life fan. I played the first one and decay on the PS2. As fun as it was, I didn't really like the controls.

I got this anthology for $14, everything in great condition. The graphics and controls were better on this version compared to the PS2, and I had a lot of fun finishing the two add ons and learning more about the game's story. I didn't get the chance to play TFC yet, but when the chance comes around, I definitely will. Overall, if you can find this bundle, get it. You'll save a lot of money and get four great games.",5.0

"Being a long-time AC fan, I was hoping for some evolution to the series, especially regarding combat. Unfortunately, combat is one aspect that has not evolved much if at all. While the upgrade system does add to the depth of combat, most events feel clunky and unresponsive, especially when you try to counter an opponent who is relentless. The weapons upgrade system feels like a setup to bait you into spending more real cash on points in order to get your character up to par. The only other option is to grind for money to get better gear which becomes quit repetitive.

All in all, Syndicate feels like a mediocre outing, and I hope Ubisoft can find a way to re-energize this series in the near future.",3.0

"The game has excellent Graphics but is a very borring game. You explore planets alone you need to walk  to explore or drive a space ship that has a stupid AI preventing to crash ( borring) everyone love to crash spaceships.

What I recommend to the developers to save the game:

1. Add civilizations, cities a don't know, morelife not just animals and plants. !!
2. Give us a Rover or a space car to explore the planets. Walking sometimes is very borring, if you to farther then the spaceship is too far away.
3. Planets are very borring, just flora, fauna, flora and fauna again and that's all in every planet.
4. We need action, ACTION. Space battles. Please more space battles, even the space are too borring.
5. Multiplayer
6. Give us action
7. Give us action

"Even though this a fun game the fun won't last then for more then a weekend.  I usually never like games of this genre but this one brought me in.  You can choose between many characters.  Each has their own unique weapon (including a sword, a spear, two daggers, and a big spiked ball) that can be usen in their own unique special move.  It sometimes can be a little hard to find out where the action is.  This is because the map is a little hard to read.  But once you find the action it is nonstop.  Even though you have a whole army with you, you do most of the fighting and this adds even more action because you are trying to fend off about ten enemies at a time.  The graphics are brilliant.  The enviroments are open and you can lead your army almost anywhere.  There is a lot of tapping the ""circle"" button in this game and it can get quite repetetive.  I reccomend renting this game for a weekend when you have a friend over so you can kill the bad guys together.",4.0
