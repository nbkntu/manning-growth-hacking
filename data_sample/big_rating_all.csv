"I like RPGs.  I like D&D.  This game, however, was not as good as I would like it to be.  Sure, it's D&D, and it is fun for a little while, but aside from that, it has repetitive music, screwish gameplay, and just horrid graphics (at least for the people and enemies).  I recommend you play this game before you buy, unless you are a hardcore D&D RPGer, or just someone with lots of money.",3.0
"I wasn't to sure about having things laid out for me to play. I am a free form player, and spend a lot of my time building and decorating the homes. But it was a lot of fun to do! I liked the 'chapters' and got to do things that normally you wouldn't do in the other Sims games. I had no loading problems as some people stated. It flowed from each 'chapter' and screen very nicely. I recommend this game if you get bored playing free form. I don't recommend it if you like going to neighborhood views, and building and decorating houses.",5.0

"The games are very well adjusted to Wii controls, with the exception of a wide screen adapted HUD. The graphics still amaze and the series continues to age well.",4.0
"I initially played Civilization on the PC a couple of years ago, which was pretty fun, but I never got into it wholeheartedly. I was looking for a game that was really just a time killer, and came upon this for the PS3. It's simple yet strategic in the controls and turn-based gameplay. This console version is actually a lot more intuitive than any PC-based versions I've played. The gibberish the characters speak is annoying and the multiplayer function doesn't work most of the time, but if you like boardgames period... it's a good buy. Keep in mind though, it's addicting!

Recommendation: If you like Monopoly or Warcraft II, get it. It's simple, straightforward, and fun.",4.0
"I've tried other thumb grips for my PS4 controllers, but these are by far the best that I've used.",5.0
"Fantastic. I have had cheap chargers in the past but this isn't one of them.
It's not a pain to place them on the charger and it does its job. It's and official Sony product and lets be honest, they don't sell junk.",5.0
"This game builds on top of the previous generation for the PS2, with better graphics, video, camera capabilities and online support.  Some improvements could include wireless mics and better selection of songs out of the box.

My favorite addition is being able to purchase songs online so that you don't have to pay for a lot of songs that you don't want as opposed to buying genre based titles as it's predecessor had you do.

Overall a great and fun gaming experience for a family or a party.",4.0
"I heard about thus game some time ago but never got around to playing it, then one day I was browsing the psn store for something fun to pass the time during  a gaming new release lull when suddenly the name of this game popped into my head, so searched for it there but it wasn't om there. I looked it up and ordered it here the price was low so I figured I was going to be disappointed and I must say I was quite surprised ay how much I enjoyed it I thought it was a great survival horror game i found the story compelling and the game play in my opinion was just as good or even better as some of the ps3 games now I like the fact that you could switch  to any character on the squad at will and that they all had different powers and weapons (Delgado being my favorite)",5.0

"Dragon Age: Origins IS the best rpg on the Ps3, and it's what the system needed.. More RPGs!! I finished my first play through a few days ago so it's still fresh in my mind, and what really kept bringing me back to the controller was the epic story and the feeling of personal involvement. I know many have spoken about the choices in this game. Well I feel that is this games best trait. Here you've got a game where I felt like my choices truely do matter and I will definitely be playing this game many more times through just to see how diverse this game is. I played a city elf male warrior, and didn't think twice about re rolling and trying another class. It's was just that compelling to me. Now at the same time my room mate purchased the PC version of the game, and I saw just how much more tactical control he had. I wish I had gotten this for the PC, but my specs aren't nearly up to par. I already had the ps3 anyways. The battle system was aggrivating to say the least at certain moments, but for the most part it worked fine. I would recommend this game to fans of fantasy and old bioware rpg's like baldurs gate and the likes.

The goods:

Extremely deep story elements and rich history to delve into.. There were parts in this game where I was so wrapped up in the rural dramas going on I had completely forgotten what the main plot of this tale was.. And I consider that a good thing.

DA has some really well developed characters, Morrigan for example, everything about her fascinated me, and the more I found out the more I dug deeper. Each of the characters in the game have personal side quests which I recommend you find. I only did about 3 of them so I will do more in the future play throughs.

Combat in the game plays surprisingly well even though it's on the ps3. At first there were issues with the radial menu, but after 70 hours it becomes second nature. The combat in DA is intense to the point it can become frustrating.. It wasn't ever so frustrating that I couldn't continue, just enough to egg me on to play one more time and try a different strategy.

The art direction in this game was a breath of fresh air. One thing that annoys me to no end is how ugly the characters in western rpgs, here all the models look great! While the graphic engine may seem dated, they utilized it to it's best ability. Good job Bioware.

I purchased all the DLC in this game, and I found it interesting and worth the extra 5 bucks. I'm glad they are making even more which I will definitely support!

The not so goods:

Graphically this game has issues on the ps3, there were certain points in dialogue where there would be no audio for whatever reason, losing chunks of the story.. Other issues were with actual looping of events where they would repeat. I had one friend who said that she had to watch a scene over 4-5 times because it wouldn't stop looping. Finally it stopped and she could continue with the game.. When the battles become large and intense there were issues with frame rate, but it wasn't game breaking at all. I just wish that Bioware would have ironed out these issues prior to release, or even if they patched later like many developers seem to be doing.

This obviously being a port the controller issue is apparent, the definitive version is on the PC, but those without that option the console version is just fine.

Final Thoughts:

At the end of the game there is this deep feeling of accomplishement, and it left me craving more, I can't wait to see where this all leads, and my imagination just runs wild.. I wouldn't spoil anything for anyone, but just take my advice.. If you have the time this game is well worth it. I wouldn't say it's the greatest game of all time, I was just really surprised, and it completely took me away from all the other games I was playing at the time.. And that rarely happens. :)",4.0
"this little gadget is priceless, many say the other versions are better cause they bigger, but that doesn't mean it will gell with your hand.
the dual shock on the other hand is convenient, it's not too small and not too big, its made by sony so no worries their, and the keys are are your fingettips, no sore hands after a couple of hours of gameplay.
also being analog, the harder you press the more the result, this is very obvious in metal gear solid, whereby the harder you press the more bullets are fired.
for me this controller is the best, the other may be cheaper now, but i know this one won't break down in a couple of months.
i did buy the transparent controller last year, but that one just lasted a couple of months then quit working, thats why i trust sonys controller more.",5.0
