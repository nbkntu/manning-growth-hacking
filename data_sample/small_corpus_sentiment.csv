As aforementioned, Hotline Miami succeeds in creating an atmosphere that reflects its 1980s setting. The color pallete and art direction strongly reminisces the 80s, while the actual graphics and pixels are more akin to a creation from the early or mid 90s. Hotline Miamis soundtrack is one of the games major immersion factors. The game predominantly features synthwave music, a fusion of contemporary electronica with 80s synth effects. Artists like Perturbator, Scattle, M|O|O|N, Sun Araw and El Huervo have contributed tracks to the game. The games art style and atmosphere of this game have also drawn comparisons to Drive and Cocaine Cowboys.
At first the battery held a charge for a while and it cycled for a few times while unexpectedly shutting off the system, but I guess that's because the battery wasn't calibrated yet. After about 3 charging cycles this thing just died. My PSP didn't even want to power with this plugged into the AC adapter.
 purchased these cables exclusively to use on my ps2, & it looks fantastic. These cables support up to 1080i if i remember correctly meaning if you intend to use these on a ps3 the picture will look great. As i stated before the cables work & fit properly in a fat & all slim model ps2's. I recommend purchasing specificly ""sony"" branded cables because the build quality of component cables varies wildly.",3.0,0.16666666666666666
-Nice smooth material
There's only one playable character this time, but the game lasts at least 5-6 hours depending on how fast you go. Not to mention that items and monsters are randomly placed each time you play the game. RE3 does improve on the lack of challenging puzzles from the last game by featuring ones that have random outcomes each time. In fact, one puzzle toward the end of the game took nearly an hour to solve! The scare factor isn't quite as high as in RE2, but a new fear element is introduced and revolves almost entirely around the Nemesis when he's chasing you. The first time I played the game, I thought that killing the Nemesis was impossible, but now I know that even on hard mode you can still best him if you use your resources properly. After the game is done, there's still plenty of unlockable goodies to acquire, such as a timed battle mini game, different outfits, and numerous epilogues to explain the story further.
Diablo 3 requires a constant internet connection at all times. Drop your connection, drop your game, start from your last save. Blizzard claims that they want their online auction house to work so they have to require online. From what I remember of D2 you had to have separate characters for online and offline. This would a great idea for D3 because they would still do their silly auction house, where people will get ripped off by the ones and zeros that Blizzard puts out for people who want to pay out more. They're going to turn it into a ""pay to win"" style game.
The graphics are on par with what was being released during that year, if not maybe a little rough here and there. Empire City looks  the absolute same regardless of what part of the map you are in; generic skyline, building structure, etc. Using Cole's super powers is pretty cool to look at, but that's really it, as far as what stands out. The music and overall sound of the game is pretty solid, although the dialog is very cliche and hokey throughout. I find this terribly annoying in some games, and InFamous is no exception: putting effort into making the main character look good (graphics-wise), then obviously half-assing it for every other NPC in the game, whether or not they are part of the plot. I can understand when it's done for NPC's that are there to simply populate the game, but the actual characters that Cole interacts with on a regular basis look horrible, sound lame, and their movements are clunky and robotic. If I were to guess, I'd say that whatever code was used for their movements was taken straight out of the first Resident Evil.
Improved visuals and on-field audio were a hyped part of the new Madden.  Okey-dokey, where are they?  The visuals are the same and, in some spots, not as crisp.  To my eye, on a 1080i Samsung 40"" LCD, it appears they added some more contrast and livened up some colors.  That's it.  The animations and player models aren't any better than 09.  Many folks seem to think so, but I'd say it's likely wishful thinking.  Some of the animations during plays looked better in 09.
"Ok for those who insist this will be a stupid and pointless game, you are dead wrong.

Now the question to me is... Now that I've seen some of the power of the PS3 tapped in MGS4, with character textures, eyes, and facial expressions that look absolutely a-fricken-mazing, combined with a very very solid in depth storyline, combined with deeply immersing gameplay... Is GTA4 really a perfect 10? Am I comparing apples and oranges? I think I am. They are two very different games, with two very different goals. But I think that MGS4 is made so well, that when put next to GTA4, people who've played both would seriously have to consider which to play. I think the only thing MGS4 really has over GTA4, is polish.

The battle system is quite interesting: you have a limited amount of time to use your character: during that time you can do anything (move, fight, use items or magic, etc) but once the time expires you must wait until it is your turn again.

But I still need help.  How do I put stuff into the crates?  How do I collect feathers from ducks when I start to bred them?

I don't need more logs!  Well, those last few points are just complaints.
1st off.  As a mature hardcore gamer.. there was a lot of titles towards the end of the wii that are actually really decent.  Being able to have the backwards compatibility to play all that stuff on my wii u is really fun.  I didn't really want a wii but being able to play those games makes the Wii U just better and has me finding some real treasures that I didn't really know about before.  Cheap games now and some of them are quite brilliant.  If you haven't been able to play Skyward Sword, No More Heroes 2, Metroid Other M, ... the list goes on and on and the best part is it that getting these games is really not that big of a deal at like 10 dollars a piece.  So what if they don't all look super HD, can always just switch back to some Wii U games when its annoying and those games look really great.

Defiance over the last 15 months is a broken game that only crossed 500k units in its sales, and the developer turned everything in it into a MONEY SCAM. Literally. The game rewards you with things you cant use unless you BUY the DLC the reward is associated with. The items you can use become useless every two weeks via a patch designed to downgrade what you have and upgrade what you haven't bought with real money.
On the plus side, the voice actors are dead on perfect, although Genie does sound a bit off...but then again, Dan Castanella of Simpson's fame isn't Robin Williams...but he's damn fine at trying. Also, the game play is solid, with the controls down perfect and the feel, really meshed out. The graphics are decent for such an older game and the storyline fills well, too.

You run through these maze-like levels, pounding the buttons, sometimes stopping to solve boring, switch/door ""puzzles"" (they didn't even bother with boxes). You cannot move the camera; the levels are so linear, your view so limited, that this might as well be 2-D.

"As a fan of zombie horror I've been looking forward to Dead Island since I first saw the trailer online. Unfortunately, rather than the gripping story and suspenseful and exciting gameplay I was looking forward to, the game consists of performing pointless fetch quests for random NPCs while engaging in repetitive and boring combat with weapons that wear down and break unrealistically quickly, even for a game.

5) The music - Eventually they will figure out that it takes longer than 10 minutes to finish a level in these games and make the music a bit more subdued or at least less monotonous. During one espescially tricky level I was ready to kill myself due to this loud and repetitive score.
There have definitely been a few fun parts, here and there.  Some parts where the chaos of battle is thick and you are running around, immersed.  Most of the time the game involves cheap one-hit kills or times of nothing followed by a massive wave of enemies.  Rinse, dry, repeat.  While there is variety in enemies, there isn't much variety in game play.  Yes, the game hits all the standard FPS style levels:  Open space with big combat, open space with big bad guy, enclosed space with low lights and is kind of spooky, enclosed space with lots of bad guys, one on one ""big boss"" battles, desolate towns, and alien spaceships.  All very generic.
"The game looks pretty good, but where are the charge characters? I'm so used to play charge characters that I can't get a hadouken motion or a double hadouken motion to come out, I play pure charge, and on Street Fighter V there are no charge characters, that's the reason why I never played Street Fighter 3 and the reason why I don't want to play SFV either, in this game some characters have charge commands, I think I'll skip this one and wait for SF6, also the game is still in the beta stage, why would Capcom sell a beta game, online drops a lot or kicks you out when playing with friends, the game lacks content, because of this the game shouldn't cost more than 20 bucks.",1.0,0.0
Scouting is fantastic! Enemy forces can be hidden until you detect them. Cavalry comes in handy for this, and it is so nice to use cavalry as the eyes and ears of an army for a change! Sadly, when you create a cavalry screen it clutters the map up. Still, effective scouts! Realistic? You bet.
I'm not sure if I got a defect but mine won't lock into place.  The locking mechanism has no hook like the stock cover.  As a result just touching the cover allowed me to move it.

"Being that I'm a Nintendo fan I did have some hesitation towards this game but still wanted to play it. I'm about half way throught the game now and can't stop playing. It basically combines what is great about the Dynasty Warrior games and fits it into the Zelda universe...and in that aspect they exceed my expectations. The story isn't the most original but I loved the nods to past Zelda games and the fighting mechanics are spot on. Why not the most graphically advance game the main characters are highly stylized and look great but the random warriors and some backgrounds could have used a bit more work; however, with any type of game where you are dealing with more than just a handful of bad guys on screen you have to expect there to be some less than amazing graphics so the framerate can keep up.

There's the lines through the screen, the cheesy 70s ""enjoy the movie"" screen, a completely non sequitur stripper sequence, missing reels, cheesy dialogue, scenes that abruptly end and more cursing than you'll know how to deal with.  In fact, according the Guinness Book of World Records, Overkill comes in as the ""most profane game"" with a recorded 189 counts of the ""F word,"" which doesn't take into account the other multitude of swear words available.  It's not so much as they curse as there's really not much to the dialogue without the cursing.  There's a lot of cussing, I guess is the take away from this.

"We finished playing this game, and found it kind of so-so-ish.
"To me, Resident Evil 4 was a VERY different detour from your usual Resident Evil game.  For one, the gameplay was entirely redesigned to have the camera fixed right behind the character to provide a third-first-person viewpoint that was later adapted in Dead Space, Gears of War, and the soon-to-be Ghostbusters film.  The largest detour from the Resident Evil franchise was the change in gameplay and story from just zombie horror survival to arcade action to not-so-zombiesque baddies anymore.  It was bold and, to a very large extent, sucessfull.  Resident Evil 5 continues this trend but to new heights.
"I only purchased this game because I thought it was like the original Sims 2 Castaway but pc version. I found this game lacking compared to the original Sims 2 Castaway. I hate the story mode in this game. It's forced (You have no choice BUT to take in that freakin Orangutan otherwise you can't progress) and there's only one way to play. It was also way too easy to play and I passed it in three days. The sandbox mode with it's ""resources"" as simoleons and the unavailability to gather individual items and make your clothing, tools and cook random yet fun food was dull. In the original Castaway you could make really tasty ""sparkly"" food, gross smelly ""green stinky"" food even ""diarrhea water drop"" food depending on your skill and what recipe you put together. In the original Castaway 2 there were many ways to play it and it felt like an adventure. You don't have that option with this one. Although I love the fact that you can have babies and add custom content that's the only thing great about it. I really hate the fact that with needs are like the needs in The Sims. Every time you get your hunger up your bladder, hygiene, environment and sometimes social are all down at the same time and it's like that with all other needs. As soon as you get one up, most of the others fall down. I also miss the build mode. I pretty much think that it would have just been better like the original Castaway with the option to add custom content and have a family if you decided to stay because that game really needed no change.",1.0,0.044444444444444446

The graphical style has probably been the most hotly debated part of the entire game (which is odd, because Zelda titles have generally been renowned more for their gameplay than for flashy graphics).  Rather than the texture-mapped pseudo-realistic 3D style you generally see (as in, say, Super Mario Sunshine), the entire game world is rendered with a technique called ""cel-shading"" (a ""cel"" being what traditional pen-and-ink animators call a single frame of animation).  This gives the game a bright, colorful, and at times cartoonish look.  It's a bit underwhelming at first, but as you explore the game world's vast terrain, you can appreciate how much style and personality it gives the game.
I thought that this would have been a fun accessory set for the Wii Sports package, but on reflection, I should have used the money towards an additional controller or nunchuck instead.
n.b. Running on the following system:
The game is also a lot of fun.  Fighting is in real-time, and you can use all kinds of materia that can level up and be combined with others.  There is something unique to this game called a DMW that has three scrolling pictures of characters, and when they line up, you get a limit break and can also level up Zack and his materia this way.  (The downside is the DMW is random, so you have little control over limit breaks and leveling up.)  There are 300 extra missions in this game, but they're all pretty similar, so I was disappointed with that.  They can get a bit boring.

Other times they were more esoteric, like hitting tennis balls to land in the right spots on a ""tag"" on the other side of the court.
