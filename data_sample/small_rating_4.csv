As far as band exclusive games this is the holy grail. I got it because a friend let me play it at his house and was surprise with the inclusion of a Mercyful Fate and that King Diamond is also in the game. I have played using the drums and that makes it double the fun to play.,4.0
"If you want to race on the rough roads with your jeep, this worth it. You can choose your jeep and the course, and go off-roading. You can race the computer of go up against a friend. So enjoy.",4.0
This is a title made by the same team who did the amazing Heavy Rain for PS3 and you can see a lot of their design in this title.  Very well made and worth the price.,4.0
"This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon. If you loved the old 1990's original, you'll enjoy this one as well. Only con to the game is replayablity, which is very limited.",4.0
"Got this game in about a week (labor day was in between) and game was wrapped up good. They did send me the platinum version with all the game content :). Its a second CD, like you have with Forza 3. So I'm glad I don't have to download it all first. First glance: Game looks really good, but I haven't been able to play it a lot though. But overall it's worth the 14.99 :)",4.0
"I struggle to find mice that can pull double duty but the Vengeance M60 comes pretty close. Being disabled (spinal cord injury) with very limited use of my hands and fingers I've had to become very creative in order to play just about any game. So I won't be quoting any fancy numbers just usability in this review. Okay back to the games, yes there are some that are simply point and click but they get boring in a hurry. That's where a good quality mouse comes in. The more it can be customized the better. This mouse isn't without issues and I would never expect to find one that didn't. I just need something I can live with. The M60 comes close and at a price that fits my budget compared to others.

On the plus side it can take a beating (I've dropped it several times unintentionally)and seems to be holding up well. I have it set up pretty close to meet my needs even with what many consider to be buggy software but I haven't noticed anything major with it. In fact it's pretty easy to set up without needing a manual an inch thick. The material it's made out of helps make it easier to grip a major plus for me.

On the minus side I'm not crazy about the corded covering all the manufacturers are using these days. For me if not kept straight or close to it they tend to get kinks in them making them harder to use. I know I could go to a wireless mouse but even the best ones tend to lag and dealing with batteries for me is a pain. About the only real issue is its size. I have fairly large hands and though they don't work as an able-bodied persons do I find that it's a little on the small side. Other than that it is working for me and with time I'll adjust to its quirks.",4.0
"Challenging, bleak, beautiful - The Banner Saga is a tough game to describe, because it is many different things. It is hard to believe that it has been two years since this title released on PC, but it is just as riveting as ever on the PlayStation 4 today as it was then.

Up here in Michigan, we like to joke that it's cold and that we might never see the sun again, but this is the stark reality facing the world of The Banner Saga. A fantasy title with a lot of European aesthetics to it, this world where the sun has disappeared and in its wake left a never ending winter is at times incredibly harsh and brutal, but the interesting personalities and gorgeous visual style help to make this a memorable game for RPG and strategy fans.

While the overarching tale is not the most unique of settings, it does help to set up a world and a tone that the game follows through on until the end. Instead, the characters are really the driving force behind this game's narrative. This is reinforced by decision making that is seldom cut and dry/right or wrong/black or white. There's shades of gray to everything you do, and that sort of compromise means few decisions are easy, and outcomes are not always what one would expect.

The story is also helped by the jumping from one group or character to another. This offers different stories, different vantages on the plot and helps to keep the somewhat slower paced plot engaging when it might otherwise falter. Still, for me the highlight here is the ability to have my decisions actually impact how the story plays out. I am always a huge fan of choice impacting the narrative, and appreciate it when games actually give weight to my decisions.

These large chunks of story are well counterbalanced by the turn-based strategy elements. The actual combat is excellent, and it reminds me of some of my favorite games of old, from Shining Force to the more popular Final Fantasy Tactics. It all works well, with steadily increasing depth and more options over time that really make you consider your next move in the combat. The system itself is a simple enough one, and that makes the control scheme something of a shame, because there are times when the button configurations just do not translate well to the controller. It is hardly a deal killer, and thankfully I was already familiar with the game, so I knew what commands did when executed. That being said, if the controls were a bit of a slog for me, I can only imagine how confusing they would be to someone who is brand new to the title and still trying to understand the systems at play as well.

Thankfully there are varying levels of difficulty that make things a lot easier to newcomers. You can make the combat itself less challenging, but also cut down on the need to rest. Or, if you really appreciate a good challenge, go for the hard setting and watch your numbers dwindle as your people continue their march and encounter new and imposing threats along the way.

There is a lot of fantastic lore to be found in The Banner Saga, and equally enjoyable strategic combat that mixes wonderfully with the different RPG elements. I felt as though my units were progressing, improving, fighting back against the bitterly harsh world they occupied. It is also a beautiful, if often sad experience, with graphics and music that really compliment a game that had me questioning my choices on many different occasions. The interesting characters help to compensate for the pedestrian overall story and the controls do not make this the smoothest PC to console transition ever. Still, there is enough variety in combat and branching of storyline that I eagerly fired up the game for a second time to see how my choices could impact the story on my next playthrough.

The presentation in The Banner Saga is something else. Perhaps the only notable shortcoming is that so little of the dialog is voiced, but beyond that? The visuals are stunning, with absolutely beautiful use of color. It has been a long time since I saw a stark landscape such as this while finding myself impressed with how pretty the game still manages to look. The music is a worthy companion, soft and subtle when it has to be, but soaring and epic at all of the right times as well.",4.0
"I got this for my kids, and its a joy to see the AI wanttobes. They would have better luck on AFV if we'd ever recorded. This is a fun game not only for the players but the ones watching.",4.0

"I got this game a while back, and I still play it. Me and my friends all think this is one of the best Multiplayer games yet. And the Arcade and Challenge modes will keep you busy unlocking stuff 'till the very end! You start out with about 25 characters to choose from, and there are at least 50 more to unlock! I strongly suggest this game if: A) You're a fan of 1st Person Shooters, B) You have friends or roomates that come over a lot and that are hungry for fun games, and C) If you have parties often.",4.0
"What will turn you on:

-Customize your character: Yes, there is only 2 races on this game but you can customize your character to your liking. Unlike previous successful MMO's that limits your class with a particular race, AION succeeds in giving us the freedom to look what we want and play the class we want. Spell casters are not limited to looking like gimpy avatars, you want a BIG HULKING caster? Go ahead!

-In-Game help/ UI: Simply put, one of the best non-modded UI currently. Map system is great; there are locate commands to steer you in the right direction; you can notify allies of Enemy positions with a simple click.

-Gameplay: Very well polished game, no matter what class you play.

-PVP: Well being ganked by a high level is no fun huh? Well unless your in the Abyss you don't have to worry about that much. If your on you own territory, most of the time your safe, you see it takes a rift for the other side to cross over so takes so much time its not worth it. PVP really takes place in the Abyss where both faction vie control of the fortresses in there. PVP takes place in land and in the sky, yes your character can fly! It takes so much strategy to overtake a Fortress, not only do you have fight NPC's controlling the fortress you have to watch your back for the other faction. Simply put, you just can't ZERG it.

-Channel system: Is your area crowded? Can't get that mob for a quest? Go to another Channel! Although some places are limited to 1 channel.

-Graphics/Sound: Simply the best looking MMO to date, the sound and ambiance of the game

What will turn you off:

-Grinding(at later levels 20+): This is a Korean made MMORPG so be prepared to grind. If you accustomed to WoW where it takes 3-4 weeks to get 60, then you might not want this. This is like the original Everquest grind, or just like any other NCSoft MMO's. Its not as bad as Lineage. At earlier levels, 1-20, questing and little grind will be enough but after 20 its pretty much 20% questing 80% grinding.",4.0
"When I ordered this game I assumed it would be the game of hunting missing ships that most of us played in our younger years.  The scenario has completely changed.  Aliens from out erspace have landed and the military is trying to locate them. The play is more complex and other than the word ""attack!"" the two games have few similarities. However, this game has the potential to be exiting and challenging.",4.0
"The brown switches in the keyboard are a joy to type and play with.
