As far as band exclusive games this is the holy grail. I got it because a friend let me play it at his house and was surprise with the inclusion of a Mercyful Fate and that King Diamond is also in the game. I have played using the drums and that makes it double the fun to play.,4.0
"If you want to race on the rough roads with your jeep, this worth it. You can choose your jeep and the course, and go off-roading. You can race the computer of go up against a friend. So enjoy.",4.0
This is a title made by the same team who did the amazing Heavy Rain for PS3 and you can see a lot of their design in this title.  Very well made and worth the price.,4.0
"This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon. If you loved the old 1990's original, you'll enjoy this one as well. Only con to the game is replayablity, which is very limited.",4.0
